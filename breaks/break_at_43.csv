1,"i swear i have seen the edge before  
in fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film  
however , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot  
in doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker  
unfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film  
but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head  
one surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script  
action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence  
even horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all  
the river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s  
the intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day  
the edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall  
i must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes  
this is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world )  
if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely )  
the edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film  
but taking scream's lead , the edge makes fun of the genre's cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively )  
charles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him  
for once , we don't immediately care for the main character  
instead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness  
they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic  
charles' birthday is the same day , and he receives a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob  
as action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect  
soon , however , bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his "" personality  "" 
charles , bob , bob's assistant steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the previews , hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter  
down the plane goes , the pilot is killed , and the three are left to survive in the wilderness  
director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow , and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations  
he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film  
take , for instance , the entire man-hunting bear plot  
this has been done many times in films with different animals , and even bears  
but given the charles' intelligence , and bob's uncertainty , many of the cliches are given fresh twists  
even charles himself seems to have seen these action films before  
my favorite line of the film comes from charles : "" most people die in the wilderness because they didn't do the one thing that could save their life    
thinking  "" 
despite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything isn't as it seems anymore  
i have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise , so instead i will avoid it entirely  
the first two-thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along , and some of charles' survival techniques seem possible , even making fire from ice  
tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear , but whenever the bear is present , the characters lose all sensibility  
i have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water  
why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ? 
i guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while  
thankfully , we already have begun to care for the characters , and so we let this small detail slide "
1,"sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to  
it's not the time or the distance , it's the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy  
yet somehow , the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story  
the wings of the dove fits the pattern  
kate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love  
merton , a newspaper writer , would like to marry kate  
but kate's "" job "" , if you will , is to be a member of the british upper class  
her father lost all of her family's money , but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man  
naturally , a newspaper writer's wages don't count as "" rich  "" 
kate leads him on , but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder , ultimately because he's not marriageable  
kate's american friend millie ( alison elliot ) stops in for a visit on her way to venice  
at a party , millie catches a glimpse of merton and likes what she sees  
kate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie , he might forget about her  
it appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup  
merton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it  
he is still in love with kate , and will accept no substitute  
the three of them , along with a fourth friend ( elizabeth mcgovern ) end up on holiday in venice together , where their interactions are quite complicated  
let's sum up : millie has fallen for merton  
merton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate  
kate loves him but can't marry him , so on the one hand she's trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy , but on the other hand she's jealous of them as a couple  
a clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick - dying , in fact  
at this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies  
millie will leave her money to merton , who will then be rich enough to marry kate  
she lets merton know of her schemes and , since it will help him win kate , he reluctantly agrees  
kate leaves venice so that the two m's can be alone together  
merton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her  
he's not sure he can separate the two  
kate finds that she's not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else  
the brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved  
without revealing the details , suffice it to say that the situation ends badly  
the title refers to the object of merton's vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament  
one is left with feelings of regret and despair  
what started as such a promising relationship was damaged by greed , anger , and jealousy  
an interesting thought struck me after the movie was over , and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of a film noir  
a couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after  
their involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other , and after a few things go wrong , the whole idea seems like an awful life-ruining mistake  
i wouldn't call the wings of the dove a film noir , but the comparison is interesting  
as i have acknowledged before , i am not a wonderful judge of acting , but i liked the performances from roache and elliot  
roache successfully conveyed his character's ambivalence toward millie : near the end , he hugs her , at first staring into space , as if he's thinking about his plan with kate , then giving that up to fully embrace millie  
millie's part didn't require as much range , but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible  
i will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low-traffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion  
their settings are far removed from my personal experience - geographically , historically , and socially  
still , the movies are well made and the stories inevitably win me over "

1,"many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come , the new film by visionary director vincent ward  
most will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors  
but little do they know ( as i so plainly found out ) that this has quite a complex story to tell  
walking out of the theater , i could see the audience's disgust    
one member even had to be awakened after the film ended  
don't believe the previews that you see    
this is definitely not a film for everyone  
this is quite possibly one of the most adult-oriented films to come out in recent years  
kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline  
the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us  
it goes back and forth in time , as if it has no boundaries  
think of the film city of angels  
now add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision  
both films deal with the afterlife , but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office  
costing around $85 million to make , the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it's money back  
but due to it's story , i doubt it will  
for everyone who thought titanic's story was too simple and cliche , here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay , it may not have done nearly as well  
but don't get me wrong    
i hope the film does do well  
it's a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen  
i doubt most of us could have thought of this place , even in our own mind  
what dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals  
the only film that surpasses it is dark city  
full of rich , shocking colors , we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to  
but don't do that , because you'll end up going to hell  
what dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake  
chris "" christy "" nielsen ( robin williams ) is startled by the sudden jolt , but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat  
annie ( annabella sciorra ) spies chris , as well , and both eventually bond and get married  
annie is an artist , whose paintings are colorful , lush , and surrealistic  
chris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself  
they also have two children , marie ( jessica brooks ) and ian ( josh paddock )  
but one day , the two children are killed in a car crash , and it almost destroys annie  
she tries to commit suicide , but fails , and is then put in an institution  
chris copes with the problem by realizing they aren't around anymore , and nothing will change that  
just as annie gets her life back in order , chris is killed while trying to save the life of a car crash victim  
chris goes to heaven , or his version of heaven , rather  
guided by albert ( cuba gooding , jr "

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
it's startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth  
the lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast  
since then , though , disney's animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year's hercules successively proving less and less potent  
with the once seemingly-impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox's anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation , the little mermaid  
while the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top-notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music  
the film's storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince  
what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions  
from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric , she's resolutely smitten , and she's such a pure and endearing character that one can't help but invest their heart with her  
this simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture  
one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters  
this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams' much-heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities  
while it's understandable that animated features lacking the name-recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto's use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia's showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it's unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy  
do we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ? 
is the film's entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ? 
 ( i'm not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan  ) 
fortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , are impeccably cast  
chief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who voices the film's heroine ariel to perfection ; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor , and gorgeous singing voice , ms  benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film  
 ( she's the only reason i'd even consider catching flubber  ) 
similarly , samuel e  wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian , the weary guardian crab  
he easily milks his lovable character's comic moments for all they're worth , and his rendering of two of the little mermaid's big tunes -- "" under the sea "" and "" kiss the girl "" -- have become the stuff of legend  
pat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea-witch ursula , while kenneth mars' booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel's father , king triton  
in large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal , and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef ) , the little mermaid is impeccably cast  
of course , the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken ( music ) and howard ashman ( lyrics ) , who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr  ashman's untimely death  
not only are mr  menken's tunes unbearably catchy , but mr  ashman's charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film's storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character's dialogue , and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film  
mr  menken's score for the film is equally top-notch ; the sequence where eric ( voiced by christopher daniel barnes ) and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse-drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr  menken's fine score  
it appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso-styled "" under the sea "" as joyfully crooned by mr  wright , which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song -- indeed , one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re-release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune -- but my favourite is ms  benson's heartfelt rendition of the ballad "" part of your world "" , an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope ( wonderfully lyricized by mr  ashman ) which , accompanied by the film's most dazzlingly polished animation sequence , packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes  
during the song's reprise , which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in , the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking , and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history  
as of this writing , november 1997 has come to an end , as has disney's limited 17-day re-release of the little mermaid  
there's no question that the primary motivation for , if not the film's reissue itself , at least its timing , was to reinforce disney's dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox's costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture , anastasia  
in every respect , the re-release of the little mermaid appears to be a success -- the film's 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $100 million mark ; the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video , pulling in close to $10 million in its opening weekend ; and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively-marketed anastasia in head-to-head competition , it siphoned enough from the fox film's opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot , allowing for disney's odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away  
but although disney's motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self-serving and protectionist , the real winner is the public  
any reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one , and it's a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen  
the little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney's modern animation renaissance , and one of the greatest animated films ever made "

1,"ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan ? 
you remember , he was the title character in that 70's sitcom , "" welcome back kotter  "" 
always trying to help out the sweathogs , frequently trying to dodge mr  woodman , ever wary of his wife's tuna casserole  
 "" so , "" you ask , "" where is he now ? "" 
mr  kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high-stakes poker  
that's right  
i'm not sure if it's his main source of income , but from what i've heard , the guy occasionally comes away with $20 , 000 at a time  
and there you were , thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off-broadway theater  
you silly goose  
well , gabe kaplan isn't in the movie rounders , nor is the film about the actor come gambler's life  
but rounders is about poker , and gabe plays poker , and i thought that was kind of a neat connection  
sorry about the segue , or lack thereof  
matt damon plays mike mcdermott , a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker  
he's been playing for a while , and more than being proficient , he has caught the bug  
he goes to all the underground games in new york city , knows the regulars , and knows how to win  
in the beginning of the film , he's built up a nice thirty grand nest egg , which he takes to the speakeasy-type gaming parlor where the big boys play  
mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb ( john malkovich ) , an oreo-munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia  
mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker , but instead he loses it all in a single hand  
months later , he's paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck  
when mike's best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students , he wants to pick up right were they left off , working as a team to part others with their betting cash  
although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student , jo ( gretchen mol ) , worm connives mike into playing once more , and mike , bitten again by the bug , slides down that slippery slope , risking his relationship , education , and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life  
to make a film about gambling , a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters  
this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth  
rounders , however , seems to go more for the latter than the former  
the card clubs mike and worm frequent aren't very glamorous at all  
there's a basement , a lodge with elk heads on the wall , a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots  
except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table  
the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it  
we're given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them  
matt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker  
ed norton's worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they're worth  
john turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments  
he's both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro's low-key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich's heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself  
martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike's law professors , abe petrovsky  
while landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one's self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending  
perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just didn't seem to have much presence on screen  
she's a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn't be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon's reactions instead  
a good thing about rounders is that it doesn't get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can't find time for humor  
the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales  
one game in a cigar club had me in stitches  
 "" i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper , "" says one of the players , clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other  
i was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys  
with all the poker being played , rounders had the potential to be very confusing "
1,"the ultimate match up between good and evil , "" the untouchables "" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry  
based on the 1959 television show of the same title , "" the untouchables "" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script  
the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public  
elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order  
however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws  
the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes  
the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws  
the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl  
from this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard  
right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs  
this developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced  
i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone  
the film only gets better from this point  
with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats  
they walk in unison and they only look forward  
as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens  
holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films  
one that comes to mind is "" the matrix "" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world  
wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style , the similarities between these two are countless  
 "" the untouchables "" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film  
the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone's army  
each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others  
elliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film  
he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be  
however , as the film develops so does ness  
his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side  
he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends  
his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in  
sean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables  
malone acts as a mentor to ness  
he teaches him "" the chicago way "" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun  
connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed  
andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer  
as ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him  
charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone  
smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film  
the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen  
also very similar to "" the matrix , "" they are exciting and intense  
>from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed  
the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement  
its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors  
the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective  
although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action "

1,"on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with  
in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his "" giallo "" murder mysteries  
while it's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller  
the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book "" tenebrae ""  
with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems  
the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa  
he brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him  
the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension  
argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business  
tenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here  
it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play  
in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes  
needless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist  
many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork  
they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria  
instead , tenebrae's set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world  
and the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment  
so tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question  
still , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative  
some critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated  
by the way , if you don't want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs  
about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious  
we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal  
he is insane , apparently  
the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife  
he is finally revealed to us as this "" second killer "" in the film's bloody climax  
but argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively  
you see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house  
but thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway  
bad cutting puts the timing way out  
in other words , he's almost in two places at once  
during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring  
by the film's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant  
the injury ? 
he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! 
thus , the revelation of the "" hero "" as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled  
helpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along  
but there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least  
the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa's mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage  
tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies  
for instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike  
we would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren't even introduced too ! 
that's careless filmmaking , pure and simple  
why , you may ask , do i go on about the story's flaws ? 
because when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world  
take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae  
an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town "

1,"jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation  
even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited , the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation  
this is , after all , the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction  
to say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood , since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio , desperado , four rooms , and from dusk 'til dawn  
he was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide  
 ( i'm willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him  ) 
tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films , but never took the director's helm  
nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more , tarantino returns with a film he can call his own  
the film opens up with an homage to the graduate , with jackie brown ( pam grier ) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her  
jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo , which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas  
this makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi ( samuel l  jackson ) who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico  
however , while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u  s  for ordell , jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus ( michael bowen ) and atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , who catch her not only with the money , but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs  
jackie didn't know they were in the package with the cash , but that's of no consequence to the authorities , who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted  
of course , dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish , ordell  
ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) to get jackie out of jail , but while max is immediately attracted to her , jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety , since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police  
sure enough , ordell shows up at jackie's apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good , but she "" borrows "" max's pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell  
instead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol's chamber to ordell's head , jackie proposes a deal  
since ordell wants to get his money out of mexico , jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more , but this time for a more substantial fee : fifteen percent of ordell's half million dollars  
with a gun in his face , how can ordell not agree ? 
by itself , this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film  
however , we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think  
jackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell , but she's also making a deal with the feds as well as with max  
the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham , but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around  
instead , it's actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today's movies  
at least this film has a little imagination  
most of the performances in jackie brown are above par  
pam grier , of whom i had never taken notice before , plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable  
samuel l  jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control  
robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy , trying to do his best   
never mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy's apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course  
he's just so down-to-earth , the nature of his job really doesn't occur to us , even when we're shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison , or when we see the tools of his trade  
in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara , a recently paroled friend of ordell's , and bridget fonda as melanie , one of the girls ordell keeps around town  
unfortunately , de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between , and then they are mostly clipped sentences  
in this film , he's not really de niro , but stereotypical de niro , uttering things like , "" little bit , "" and "" pretty much  "" 
fonda , on the other hand , plays the slightly spaced-out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness , such that even when she is annoying louis , we are taking her side  
as is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand , the dialog is quick and snappy  
it grabs our attention and is actually interesting , and in many respects , this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals ; the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves  
don't count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera , however  
there's a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange , and he's not really sure what's happening , but by composing the scene just so , his realization of what's going on is felt simultaneously by the audience "

1,"do film critics have morals ? 
are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow ? 
naturally we don't want to go into a film with any preconceived notions , which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish  
secondly , and along the same line , we can't prejudge a film because of it's stars , director , etc  the difference ? 
well , in the first one , we'd go into a film thinking it's going to be dumb or it's going to be good , and that would affect our viewing ( that movie sounds and looks dumb , so i'm not expecting much )  
on the second hand , we're simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal "" grudge "" against the film company ( it's made by disney ? 
oh , it's just a merchandising ploy then ) , the actors ( jim carrey's in it ? 
it's gonna stink ! ) , or the director ( who ? 
can't be that good )  
this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint  
make sense ? 
ok , but what about comparing ? 
isn't that kind of along the same lines ? 
when we compare a certain actor or director or even composer's credibility in one film to another they were involved in , is that really fair ? 
sure , in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more , but what about jackie brown , for example ? 
is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction , just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ? 
i think it is , and i'll tell you why  
a good critic should be able to view the film from the "" average joe ( or jane ) "" viewpoint , while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film  
sometimes that can be tough  
 "" the acting was superb , but i was bored "" or "" i loved it ! ! 
it was sooooo cheezy ! "" 
might be used to describe a film  
these are contradictions , and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique  
but which is more important ? 
and which is better ? 
an extremely well shot and acted film that is boring , or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ? 
getting back to the point , my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we're reflecting what the public wants to know anyway  
every average person out there who's interested in this film is likely to ask "" how does it compare to pulp fiction ? "" 
and so , as a critic , i'm already responsible to ask that same question  
jackie brown stars pam grier , the "" blaxploitation "" heroine from the 1970's , who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character  
tarantino's pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta's sudden revival in the movie industry , and with talks of an oscar nomination , the same is likely to happen for grier  
 ( we've made it thru comparison #1 ! ) jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction's samuel l  jackson and comparison #2 )  
ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara ( robert de niro ) , a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years , to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half- million dollars  
trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics , as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed  
naturally this proves an obstacle to ordell's plans and , not as friendly intended as we'd hope , he posts jackie's bail after she is put behind bars  
the thing is , ordell is in this for no one more than himself , and as we learn from his previous actions , he's willing to kill anyone who stands in the way  
jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze  
ordell won't think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she's always done , yet at the same time , a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided  
it comes down to a simple question : would jackie rather face ordell or prison ? 
what ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help : the law , ordell , or maybe just herself  
coming into play is another 70's veteran , robert forster as jackie's bail bondsmen max cherry  
max's obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system , and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance  
also involved is ordell's "" surfer girl "" girlfriend melanie ( bridget fonda ) , a ditzy sun- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand  
fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role , but there's nothing more to her , and therefore , she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters  
de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself  
de niro is a brilliant actor , but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn't need a de niro to play him  
compared to pulp fiction ( comparison #3 ) , the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable  
in pulp fiction , even the small , seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful , complete , and lifelike , whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn't have suffered much with a lesser talented cast , the exception being grier  
tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind , so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth  
sadly , grier too could have received a bit more attention , especially when the story is all about her newly-jarred perception of life  
jackson teams up with tarantino again , but the chemical reaction isn't as awesome as the first time  
jules was the rambling , bible-quoting hitman in pulp fiction , and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off  
and although jackson is really , really good in jackie brown , i don't think he's quite as irreplaceable  
in fact , maybe a new face would have been better  
jackson could've remained tarantino's jules , and a new guy could have become ordell , forever to remain so in our memories  
sadly , these characters are too much the same , except ordell just isn't as impressive , and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules  
another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning  
this is grier's film , so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses ? 
it not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted , but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story  
it is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino's quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style , and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard's novel "" rum punch ""  
for those movie-goers , don't expect another pulp fiction and you'll be satisfied , for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90's film- making "

1,"steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities , because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits , like jurassic park , and "" oscar "" -awarded critical triumphs like schindler's list  
however , in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories  
one of them is close encounters of the third kind , extremely popular and influential science-fiction spectacle  
unfortunately , it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars  
although both films have a lot in common ( ground-breaking special effects , brilliant score by john williams ) their future was different ; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon , and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow  
when spielberg began work on that project , he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit , jaws  
together with other young directors of his "" new hollywood "" generation , like kauffman , carpenter , hill and millius , he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s , when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment  
ironically , it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of "" blockubuster "" philosophy  
but in the mid 1970s , many things were different ; spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie  
although very personal , spielberg's screenplay was partly based on the book "" ufo experience "" by dr  j  allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2  
spielberg was not only inspired by the mythology , but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost , unmatched until the contemporary era of x-files and the roswell anniversary  
that was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo-related incidents as the element of the plot  
the story begins with one of such incidents - team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u  s  navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19  
such events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary ( richard dreyfuss ) , power company worker from muncie , indiana , who later becomes obsessed with his experience  
because of his obsession he loses his job , family and sanity , but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler ( melinda dillon ) , single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction  
in the meantime , the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u  s  government , in co-operation with the french , led by lacombe ( francois truffaut ) begin with the preparation for ultra-secret project  
when the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary , he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area  
there he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions  
two of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there  
spielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects  
the slow , gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents - "" close encounters "" - is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale  
but , instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws , we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder  
throughout the movie the viewer knows that something big , magnificent and wonderful is about to happen , and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end  
the last sequence , with its , even in this age , impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull , would leave many mouths open  
one of the great virtues of this film is its optimism  
aliens , who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in science-fiction cinema , are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is a beginning of something wonderful  
it is very ironic , when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story - howard hawks' thing and byron haskin's war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind  
spielberg's humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era ; the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post-watergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public  
but , even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chain-smoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to x-files and its more cynical and disturbing visions  
there lies the main , and probably the only flaw of this great picture - lack of conflict , and consequently , lack of drama  
the movie has few excitements or even action scenes ( especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock's north by northwest ) but generally , almost everyone - neary , jillian , government , aliens - are the good guys  
despite such shortcomings , the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles  
richard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary , yet nice guy , who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale  
melinda dillon was , on the other hand , nominated for "" oscar "" as a struggling mother , yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as neary's long-suffering wife ronnie  
apart from visual wonders of this film , spielberg's semi-official composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music , this time using the simple melody both as the element of a plot , and as the basis for his score  
the aliens , who are the main subject of this film , were visually very convincing  
too convincing , one of my acquaintances in the ufo-researching circles said "
1,"melvin van peebles' "" sweet sweetback's baadasssss song "" was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement  
it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident  
its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before  
in style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , "" sweet sweetback "" was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter  
van peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built "" sweet sweetback "" from the ground up almost entirely by himself  
because no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself  
the movie ended up costing about $500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby  
van peebles cut costs by hiring non-union labor and taking on most of the film's responsibilities himself  
he wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role  
he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck  
for instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases "" rated x by an all-white jury , "" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film  
he also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling  
the storyline in "" sweet sweetback "" is deceptively simple  
it takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex  
one day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they're bringing in suspects on a politically-charged case involving murder  
however , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu-mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously  
acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death  
the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico  
although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles' camera to roam the darker side of l  a  - the ghettos , alleys , and back-street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked  
van peebles' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored  
at the beginning of "" sweet sweetback , "" he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : "" sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality    "" 
van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration  
of course , with today's abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , "" sweet sweetback "" doesn't seem all that revolutionary  
it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made  
at that time , "" sweet sweetback "" was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it  
distributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles' words , gave the black audience "" a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass  "" 
of course , once it caught on , it caught on big  
 "" sweet sweetback "" is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates "" sweetback "" from other movies like "" shaft "" ( 1972 ) and "" the mack "" ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios  
 "" sweet sweetback "" is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers  
however , even if when viewed from an african-american perspective , "" sweet sweetback "" is certainly not without its controversies  
when it was first released , an article was published in "" ebony "" magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it  
there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of  
others have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives  
still others point to the clich ? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm  
nevertheless , a movie like "" sweet sweetback "" cannot be made without conflicting points of view  
it is a revolutionary movie not because it's about one man's defiance , but because it put front-and-center black issues that had never been dealt with before  
until that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites  
the fact that "" sweet sweetback "" was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply "" the black community "" )  
van peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between "" sweet sweetback "" and all movies that had come before it "

it's title : starship troopers  
and surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4  
i realize that i gave last year's sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour  
after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn't as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review  
starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem  
as a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film  
in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film  
starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether  
while starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : "" the 'star wars' of the 90s  "" 
am i being to generous to this film ? 
perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races  
in essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction  
the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to  
starship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a "" kick-the-aliens'-asses "" style  
id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role  
this new "" star wars "" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs  an alien species  
the alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects  
however , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy  
sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization  
more than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends  
and they should be  
i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film  
this is an "" event "" film , but surprisingly above average  
it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved )  
starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange "" join the army "" ads  
mixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original  
stating , "" would you like to know more ? "" , 
these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously  
however , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way  
after witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw  
we are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards )  
rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms  
however , carmen isn't as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot  
however , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico  
unfortunately , rico isn't interested in dizzy  
this setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch  
carmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up  
and as a result , dizzy signs up  
everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry  
the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships  
in reality , i found myself watching a space version of "" melrose place , "" but with better special effects  
an hour into the film , the war begins  
a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with  
the first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) "

1,"oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with ! 
in a perfect world , "" a civil action "" would be a breath of fresh air  
it's cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isn't  
it's romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham book/film isn't  
and , the capper , it has no distinct ending , and the law in hollywood films is that above all else , you must have an ending  
even if it's based on a true story , a true story which hasn't yet ended , you must supply an ending , a false one , but an ending nevertheless  
hell , "" a civil action "" is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together ( and that includes "" the firm , "" the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic )  
yet it's also oddly and slightly unsatisfying  
weird  
this is , in fact , a steve zallian film , not just the work of a hack , and zallian is the director of the much-admired "" search for bobby fischer "" ( didn't see it ) and writer of none other than "" schindler's list  "" 
in short , i like this guy , and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories  
after all , apart from the obvious it's-a-holocaust-film and it's-a-spielberg-film , isn't "" schindler's list "" just a damn brilliant film , not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study  
 "" a civil action "" is the same way : it's narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study  
and it's here that the film seems to go a bit wrong  
the main complaint of this film is that while , yes , it's an engrossing lawyerly tale , it has no real ending , and that's not necessarily the problem with the film  
it's that it's just kind of unsatisfying  
if this were a great film , it would feel complete , and still end basically the same way  
but this film just seems to end , and i don't want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on : imagine , if you will , being one of those the film is about , looking forward to this film , and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter , just so the many won't bitch about what is , essentially , genuine  
but the fact that it just ends is not , in all actuality , what is wrong with it  
it's rather that zallian has chosen , in the last half hour , to adandon the traditional lawyer story , and chose the other part of his story , the one about the lawyer , one jan schlictman ( john travolta ) , who's shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer , brilliant because he's manipulative and he always wins  
it wishes to make it all about jan in the end , but the truth is , his change , although nicely done , is not full  
we see him suffering from a personal crisis , and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart , but in the end , we don't fully believe it  
and i think that the problem is when he has made his decision , the film choses an odd angle to go at , a noble one , but one that gives the film's conclusion that of incompleteness  
in the opening of the film , we see him doing his old schtick , manipulating courts , winning cases effortlessly , and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases  
in short , he's full of bullshit and we know it  
in the film , he takes a case that is hardly desired : a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river  
point one , it's not of the usual criteria ( jan points out , wickedly , that dead or wounded children aren't nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success )  
point two , it has been through several lawyers  
after turning them down , jan changes his mind ( a muddled scene - he stops his car on a bridge , looks out    is he feeling a sense of overachievement ? ) , and he and his team of lawyers ( tony shalhoub , zeljko ivanek , and accountant william h  macy ) head out to the town to do battle with the town's company  
they spend millions of dollars examining the land , test the water , what have you ( this is where stephen fry , a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in "" wilde , "" pops up thanklessly ) , and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children , and then , unsuccessfully , the workers at the plant  
they also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company , the eccentric jerome facher , played by robert duvall ( more on him later on )  
as we progress , we get so involved in the way the story is being told , which is engulfing everything around it , including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople ( one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland , who lost her child , who begins to have a personal crisis )  
things begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half , as they are up against impossible odds : the judge ( john lithgow ) is not only a strickler , but a pal of facher ; the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify ; no concrete evidence is being found , depsite the money spent to find it ; and they are quickly running out of money  
as macy mortgages everything he can , including their homes and their office , he slowly loses his sanity ( his meatiest role since , oh , "" fargo "" ) , and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist  
in fact , the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par ( owen gleiberman , especially , criticized the film for not being overly-dramatic    i 
suppose like a grisham novel )  
this wouldn't be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is : instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good , he's seen as being still full of bullshit  
because he doesn't take stock in the cares of his partners , and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town , he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out "

1,"vampire films , as well as other horror films , are usually dumb and predictable b-movies , meant to scare us by cliches and simple shocks  
it is therefore interesting to watch neil jordans recent film that is not only visually stunning , but has also a plot worth making movies about  
based on anne rice's novel , "" interview with a vampire "" is a long , dark trip to hell  
the film opens with gothic quire and dark streets of present-day san francisco  
the camera slowly find particular window  
a shape of a young man is visible in the darkness  
 "" so you want me to tell you the story of my life ? ""  
the mysterious man is louis ( brad pitt ) , a two-century old vampire , telling his story to a fascinated interviewer ( christian slater )  
his tale opens in 1791 louisiana , just south of new orleans , where louis falls victim to the vampire lestat ( tom cruise )  
given a choice between death and eternal life as one of the undead , louis chooses the latter , a decision he will forever regret  
everlasting life and eternal youth , promised to him by lestat , turn instead into never ending suffering , damned to eternal hunger for blood and longing for peace  
louis cannot kill with the impunity of lestat , but , to sate his hunger , he must feed , and the blood of animals is not enough  
eventually , he pierces the neck of a grief-stricken young girl named claudia ( kirsten dunst ) , whom lestat then curses with his unholy form of resurrection so that she can be a surrogate daughter to both himself and louis  
for a while , they are one "" big , happy family  "" 
but all things end , and claudia's growing resentment of lestat fuels a bloody confrontation  
when luis and claudia break loose from lestat , they travel to paris , where the euro-vamps santiago ( stephen rea ) and armand ( antonio banderas ) , who introduced them to a bigger world of the damned  
director neil jordan ( "" the crying game "" ) together with the talented director of cinematography philippe rousselot and composer elliot goldenthal has created an incredible atmosphere  
as the film begins , there is an incredible palette of colors , beautiful sunrises , lush golden fields , green forests , inky-blue clouds and blending sun  
when luis is "" born to darkness "" , everything suddenly changes to dark velvet , lit only by the silver moonlight  
the beautiful production design by dante ferretti , wonderful costumes and art direction by malcolm middleton re-create the multiple historical periods in the film  
from the renaissance new orleans and the beautiful rococo paris of the 18th century , to our present days  
the casting is likewise good , involving some of the most famous and beautiful stars of hollywood , ireland and spain  
the controversial casting of tom cruise as lestat is incredibly effective  
cruise is energetic , sinister , charismatic , wild and bloodthirsty  
cruise's lestat likes to seduce young women before exacting his dark red sustenance  
with alarming swiftness , the victims switch from sexual excitement to outright horror , as his murderous purpose becomes clear  
 ""    kill them mercifully , but do it  
you are what you are   for 
do not doubt , you are a killer ! "" 
that is how lestat is teaching luis  
but behind that furious facade is anger and loneliness that he carries through the centuries and tries to smother with nightly rampages  
brad pitt is equally convincing as the "" vampire with a human soul ""  
antonio banderas and stephen rea are effective , but since they play more or less secondary characters , their performances are almost invisible  
the greatest performance in the film comes suprisingly from the young kristen dunst , who manages to create an incredibly emotional and believable character  
the world is changing around the little child , but she does not  
she remains unchangeable - a child for all eternity  
only her wise , dark eyes reveal her age  
ironically the film's only miss is the script  
anne rice's novel is a very interesting read , and her script is rich , colorful and emotional , but it is also tiering and too melancholic , at times resembling a soap opera : 
claudia : ""  "

[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats] 
it's very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic , vivid sense of reality and life  
all stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters' lives , but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do  
therefore , "" gone with the wind "" deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does , in such a crafted , intricate , and entertaining manner  
it's a crowning achievement , not only in filmmaking , but for storytelling itself  
the film takes place in georgia before , during , and after the civil war  
this plays a major factor in the film's success  
to use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy  
it might also seem cliche , boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers  
can a story set so long ago be relatable now ? 
the film confronts all these problems , paradoxically , by not cronfronting them  
it doesn't simply plug in the "" right thing "" at the "" right time , "" it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant  
building a strong foundation is important to all forms of media , without which , what is there to build on ? 
we're given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters , especially our main character , scarlett o'hara ( leigh ) , a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel , a cunning wit , and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time  
she knows how her society works , wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her  
right from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be  
being the most sought-after woman allows her to manipulate men ( and their women ) to ensure she gets her way , whether it be obvious ( i  e  
who will be the one to get her food ) , or subtle ( i  e  
getting married just to spite someone )  
the man she claims to love is ashley wilkes ( howard ) , a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him  
he isn't so arrogant and demanding as scarlett , in fact , he's engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his  
her name is melanie ( de havilland ) , and she is one of the sweetest , kindest , and most likable characters one will ever see  
she and scarlett become very dear friends , but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her , and the love she has for her husband  
her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic - it defines who she is , but doesn't give her much emotional self-defense  
acting a catalyst to the love triangle , and to the story as a whole is the daper , stong-willed , cunning , cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler ( gable )  
he's quite a character all right - everyone listens to what he has to say even though he's got a bad reputation  
butler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior  
he tells everyone the much-needed truth in the rigid caste-like society where freewill doesn't seem to exist , everything is done out of honor and tradition  
for example , in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there's no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out  
this angers them , not for his lack of faith , but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that  
 "" do we have ammunition factories ? 
do we have food ? 
do we have a navy ? 
all we have is tobacco  "" 
all true statements and yet the south still insists he's wrong  
butler is a shifty character to be sure , but he takes such pride in his arrogance it's appealing  
scarlett notices this too when she first sees him , and from the look butler gives her , we know he's not going to stop until he has her  
but scarlett can't get past her need for ashley , and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story , butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever  
and so the story goes on , with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life  
the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband , especially after she is "" marked "" for life when her first husband dies  
this gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story  
some are vital for only a few scenes , but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film  
in most films only a few characters exist for support in background , but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance  
even people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set "

1,"note : ordinarily , moviereviews  org will not give away any critical plot points of a film that could be interpreted as "" spoilers  "" 
however , being that music of the heart is based on a true story and that moviereviews  org 
feels the film can not be properly credited without such revelations , plot giveaways will appear in the following review  
if this bothers you , please note the 3 star rating of the film and stop reading now  
 "" what does it take to play carnegie hall ? 
practice  "" 
it takes two hours for music of the heart to "" play carnegie hall , "" both figuratively and literally  
like the children it portrays , the movie starts from the dark realms of awful cinema and works its way up to a show-stopping performance at the legendary concert hall  
roberta guaspari ( academy award winner meryl streep ) has two kids , a husband who left her and 50 violins she bought from a small shop in the mediterranean  
her life desperately needs a jump start and gets one when she meets a man who introduces her to a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementary school  
she soon finds her job is on the rocks as the men in her life continue to rotate through revolving doors  
that is the pattern-like plot of this production  
ultimately , the film chooses a zero-sum answer to these problems and finds her music career at an all-time high when the men in her life finally vanish  
the first hour of music of the heart is rather painful  
roberta's character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat  
also lacking depth is the film's "" bad guy , "" a narrow-minded music teacher ( josh pais ) who rejects roberta out of principle ( the movie never explains exactly which principle that is ) and conveniently comes and goes from the plot according to when it might be dramatic to have a villain around  
the next 15 minutes of the film are mediocre  
they are highlighted by one child's return to roberta's class ( coming after the great old hollywood scene where he explains be can't be around anymore because "" my mom said    "" ) and a glowing concert  
not knowing the running time , you may expect the credits to role at this point  
but they don't  
instead the film uses the next 45 minutes to finish its journey from bad to mediocre to excellent  
director wes craven , known for his works of horror , uses some old sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing  
one romantic break up scene is highlighted by the classic "" but    
last night    "" 
and roberta's two children also have textbook conflicts with their single mother regarding their father's absence  
the city of harlem plays a strong role in the movie  
roberta's mother is initially reluctant to see her daughter move to that part of town and the film does nothing to combat that stereotype  
the noise tracks for these scenes are dominated by sirens ; predictably one of roberta's students is gunned down and killed off screen  
one thing the film does lack is subtlety  
the fact that a little boy was playing "" we shall overcome "" on his violin after the aforementioned shooting was a cute and discreet reference  
the fact that the entire orchestra begins to play it over and over soon after is an overdone reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience  
 ( of course , in horror films the foreshadowing and between-the-line moments are meant to be overdone , so perhaps he too is just learning to play the game  ) 
even with all its flaws , music of the heart is a beautiful film  
that is not an excuse for the movie's poor beginning  
but as i watched the scenes in carnegie hall , i thought of some of the great acts that have taken that stage  
in december of 1979 a comedian named andy kaufman put on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in theatre history "
1,"many people dislike french films for their lack of closure  
while possibly shallow , i've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view  
there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil )  
stephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker  
he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing  
even the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches  
in the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man  
camille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes  
maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife  
like stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges  
when stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals  
however , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him  
stephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present  
as the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another  
these two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently  
stephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship  
however , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation  
the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher  
however , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing  
consequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays  
in contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier  
however , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world's finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing  
during the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions  
stephane attempts to remain unchanged  
however , we do see subtle hints of his transformation  
one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash  
the development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible  
american movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development  
in its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane  
the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille's and stepahne's characters  
i am not sure why berardinelli says , "" at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil's credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty  "" 
this movie is not about judging stephane's actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are  
i find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling  
this portion of the film is where the "" sense of closure "" could have been successfully accomplished  
unfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters  
while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film  
the synergism of the tension of ravel's music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen  
the directing in this movie is wonderful  
the actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth  
emmanuelle beart's personality is beautiful  
and needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful  
besides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral  
i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of "
1,"here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop  
okay , it isn't quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart  
most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them  
however , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered  
a lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash  
but , the thing is , it isn't  
it's well made , well acted , and quite intelligent  
i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film  
but the species series isn't about the lack of these elements  
it's about how much it can get into one film  
and yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so  
species ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe  
many films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film's needs  
species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars  
aboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut  
patrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed  
well , it would seem that he has succeeded  
landing on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so  
of course , he isn't the first ever  
about a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life  
now , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky  
no life lives on it  
that is , no visible life  
patrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground  
he takes them aboard , and puts them in storage  
unfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship  
just prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings  
they pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can't even remember  
they blame it on a technical malfunction  
back on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible  
as we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet  
however , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is  
patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge )  
eve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien  
however , this time around , most of her "" alien "" urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant  
the project is led by dr  laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable  
since she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again  
and it has  
story-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can't tell me it was strong on story )  
what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay  
in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles  
this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) "

plot : follow the lives of several couples falling in and out of love , finding themselves , regaining a clearer understanding of the people that they are , and who they want , and appreciating the fine emotional art of love  
critique : charmingly effective romantic drama , this film offers insight into various types of relationships , presents us with interesting characters and excellent performances from the cast , and scratches beneath the surface of love and its many complex subtleties  
how do people fall in love ? 
why do people fall out of love ? 
how do people fall back into love , once they've been hurt and left to join the lonely hearts club ? 
all of these questions and more , are touched upon in this film , within several types of variant relationships  
meet a hip , young couple going through their first date  
a divorcee attempting to date again after her many failed relationships  
a married woman "" finding herself "" while cheating on her husband  
a husband letting go of his inhibitions  
an older couple dealing with a past "" love "" of the man , a secret recently uncovered  
a son dying from aids , joined by his mother at the hospital  
there are many nuances to this picture , and many ideas and quotes to which we could all relate , but more importantly , there is diversity  
diversity of relationships helped me and my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels  
some related to the younger couples' issues  
others with the married  
there's a little bit of everything for everyone in here  
and i would bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch this film again in a year , i would relate myself to yet another predicament  
just like love itself , this movie is distinct and appreciated by all on many different levels  
the actors in this film are all also very , very good  
sean connery is solid as the older man with some issues to resolve , as is gena rowlands , as the aging wife with trepidations  
jolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance , while philippe is as pretty-boy as ever  
anderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to re-ignite her love life , opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by former talk-show host , jon stewart  
even dennis quaid manages to step outside of his overacting shoes in this film , and offers a convincing show of a man lost within his own imagination  
the only piece of this puzzle which left me somewhat detached , was the part surrounding jay mohr , the man dying from aids , and his mother , ellen burstyn  
the actors were fine , but somehow , the piece seemed out of place within the realm of everything else  
the ending of this film was also a little too saccharine for me , but i guess that's just hollywood  
this film is actually a lot like your friends and neigbors ( 5  5/10 ) and happiness ( 4  5/10 ) in concept and style , but its complete anthesis in regards to character relatibility and likeness  
the characters in those films were too unique and inhuman for anyone to care , as opposed to this film , which offers rich and believable characters , living real lives and talking about real issues in today's relationships  
all in all , this movie offers many interesting characters , talking and living genuine and engaging love lives , wonderful performances by its solid cast , too sweet of an ending , but an enjoyable and rewatchable movie nonetheless  
little known facts about this film and its stars : according to a story in the london sunday mirror , sean connery asked for only $60 , 000 for his role in this movie , as compared to his usual fee of $14 million , because he liked the script so much  
on top of that , he convinced his co-stars ( including gena rowlands , gillian anderson , ellen burstyn , et al  ) to do the same  
this is director/writer willard carroll second real foray into the world of "" adult films ""  
before this , he had written and produced many children's movies  
gillian anderson stands 5'2  
angelina jolie's full name is angelina jolie voight  
she is actor jon voight's daughter  
she has trained and performed at the lee strasberg theatre institute

1,"capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg  
joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs  
it lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure  
the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious  
i had a good time  
 , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
here goes my credibility  
this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority  
i liked the third jurassic park film  
i even liked the second jurassic park film  
in a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton's novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle's novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle  
jp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , "" for the boy who's half man or the man who's half boy  "" 
that is what all the jurassic park films are  
expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house  
the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon's mines had under-written characters also  
jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs  
the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting  
some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds  
that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require  
i feel i got my money's worth  
the story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica  
this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park  
they hope , no doubt , to get a look at the island's dinosaurs from a safe height  
the height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not  
the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended  
flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide  
he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs  
but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go  
doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h  macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs  
they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn  
he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once  
right  
guess what happens next ? 
jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2  
first it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm  
sattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first  
curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance  
one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time  
they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films  
of course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species  
not only are they more intelligent than in the past films , they are also more sympathetic  
in this story they are not just killing machines , they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition  
this time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized  
each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs , of course "

1,"some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese's raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the '80s  
since there are still a number of '80s films that i haven't seen , i don't feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i'll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level  
bio-pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry , dull textbook account  
it's rare that a movie with the moniker "" based on the life of ? "" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining  
raging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre  
the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the '40s and '50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen  
for all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying  
historically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion's share of the details culled from la motta's own autobiography ( which was co-written with joseph carter and peter savage )  
however , although la motta is credited as the movie's "" consultant , "" he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout  
the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ? paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage  
sex and violence are inextricably linked  
the title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull  
in the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them  
outside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled  
the two people who spar with him on life's canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother/manager , joey ( joe pesci )  
these are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses  
he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence  
raging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up-and-coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class  
over the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch-rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match  
meanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15-year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife  
vicki becomes jake's greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain  
his own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him  
hence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ? perhaps even his brother  
 ( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : "" are you f * * king my wife ? ? ? "" ) 
in the late '40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall  
he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing  
two years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray  
by the late '50s and early '60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ? a broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine  
raging bull is the other side of rocky  
sylvester stallone's tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976  
it won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production  
but , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring  
while scorsese's primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man , he never backs away from showing the seedy , ugly underside of a sport where gambling , greed , and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working  
rocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased  
there's little i can say here that hasn't already said about de niro's performance  
in a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding  
the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering  
and , although there's a lot of travis bickle ( de niro's character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him  
this is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting  
as the younger jake , de niro is trim and fit  
as the fat , older man , de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form  
how many actors would go that far ? 
the best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance  
cathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work ( although neither won )  
their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro's "

1,"nosferatu the vampyre ( germany 1979 ) 
a film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson 
this extraordinary re-telling of bram stoker's "" dracula "" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore  
inspired by f  w  murnau's 1922 silent film of the same name , herzog's film is a work of exquisite bleakness , an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards  
the original full-length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u  s  distributor anchor bay entertainment , and in gorgeous widescreen prints  
until now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video , and only in europe  
both of these re-releases restore the film to its full length , but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue  
apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent , and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed  
the german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one  
everyone knows the story of dracula  
or do they ? 
his story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly won't hurt  
jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count ( played by klaus kinski ) who wants to buy a house in harker's hometown  
upon seeing a photo of harker's wife ( the radiant isabelle adjani ) he instantly falls in love with her  
locking harker up in his castle , he sets off on a long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him  
upon divining his identity as a vampire , adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises  
that is a story familiar to millions , but herzog has elevated stoker's tale into the realm of - and i use this term a tad reluctantly - cinematic art  
nosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film , shot through blue-ish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised  
the film's surreal , dream-like quality is utterly mesmerising  
there is much to enjoy , but i'll limit my praise to a few key points  
holding the film together is kinski's remarkable performance as count dracula  
past screen portrayals , including bela lugosi's famous turn , have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp  
but kinski    oh boy , this is something far more compelling  
aided by a startling make-up job , he portrays dracula's vampirism not simply as pure evil but as some sort of loathsome disease  
this man is dreadfully lonely  
he lives in utter solitude , shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust  
kinski's portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting  
when he dies , you almost feel as if this man's tortured soul has been freed at last  
then there's the unforgettable soundtrack , largely composed by german group popul vuh  
it is so eerily beautiful and evocative that it's quite impossible to imagine the film without it  
popul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancient-sounding kind of spacemusic using piano , chants , and exotic instruments  
when i first saw this film some years ago i was so impressed i tracked down and bought a number of their albums  
the one i still listen to the most is "" tantric songs "" , from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken  
it's a testament to the music's depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is with them  
the album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies  
this is a timely re-release by anchor bay  
after francis ford coppola's unscary and woefully overblown version of bram stoker's tale in 1992 , it is a joy to go back to herzog's film and see the amazing things he has done with what is now a century-old story  
to some aficionados , nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made  
without a doubt , it is an unmistakable classic of the genre "
1,"most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts  
my family , for the most part , hates him and his movies  
i think he's very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years  
so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of  
unrestrained by physical boundaries , allen's humor comes shining through  
those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen's intelligent observations of life  
those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one  
in 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they'd never seen before  
toy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present  
many critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture  
antz , however , has upped the ante considerably  
disney's a bug's life isn't due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal  
by beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience's thirst for computer-animated films  
but don't let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared  
in the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios  
in 1997 , it was the volcano duel  
in my opinion , dante's peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality  
volcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations  
in 1998 , there are twice as many competing films  
first was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it's cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact  
but now , it's even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks )  
who will prevail ? 
time will tell , but i'm sure that mr  mouse has nothing to fear  
this may sound like i didn't like antz ; on the contrary , i'd put it up there with toy story  
but due to it's pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn't appear in disney's version  
some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film  
sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd  
the humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended  
this is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents  
antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen's shtick and franz kafka's metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug  
z ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker  
 "" when you're the middle child in a family of five million    "" he comments about his neglected childhood  
one night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life  
in walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown  
bala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader  
after discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there's a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony  
in order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants  
but to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her  
he and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed  
the queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony "

1,"deep rising is one of "" those "" movies  
the kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us  
it does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god    screw that , it says boldly , let's see some computer generated monsters rip into , decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors  
heh ! 
them wacky monsters , gotta love 'em  
of course , since we can rent about a thousand b movies with the same kind of story , hollywood must give that little extra "" oumph "" to get people in theaters  
that is where deep rising fails , which is a good thing  
confused ? 
let me explain : 
despite all them flashy effects and big explosions , deep rising is still , at heart , a good 'ol b movie  
luckily , it's a very good b movie  
the worst cliches in movie history are a b movie's bread and butter  
therefore , things that would destroy a serious movie actually help us have a good time while watching a movie of lower calibre  
of course we know there's a big slimy creature behind that door , that one person will wander off to be picked off by said monster and we always know which persons or person will make it out alive  
we just don't know when or how horrible it will be  
i went to see deep rising with my expections low and my tolerance for bad dialogue high  
imagine my surprise when i discover that deep rising is actually , well , pretty darn funny at times  
a funny b movie ? 
well , that's new  
these flicks are not supposed to make us laugh  
 ( except for a few unintended laughs once a while  ) 
and before you know it , treat williams , wes studi and famke jansen appear on the big screen  
hey ! i know them guys ( and gal ) from a couple of other movies  
cool  
familiar faces  
so far so good  
our man treat is the hero , he'll live  
wes is a staple of b movies , he is the token victim  
we know he'll buy the farm but he will take a few creeps with him on the way out  
famke is the babe , 'nuff said  
there is also a guy with glasses ( the guy with glasses always dies ) a black person ( b movie buffs know that the black guy always dies , never fails ) and a very funny , nerdy guy  
 ( ah ! 
comic relief  
how can we possibly explain having to kill him    let 
him live  ) 
after the first fifteen minutes i felt right at home  
i know who to root for and who i need to boo too and a gum to chew  
 ( please kill me  ) 
suffice it to say that for the next hour and a half i jumped out of my seat a few times , went "" ewwww "" about a dozen times and nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing  
i'm a man , we nottice these things  
all in all , i'd recommend deep rising if you are looking for a good time and care to leave your brain at the door   "
1,"with the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up , loading their guns , kissing each other and uttering what sounds like "" rock and roll ! "" 
 ( actually , it's "" lock and load "" ) , you can't help thinking tarantino  
and of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery , the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie & clyde to natural born killers  
but if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction , exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run , normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon  
 "" inspired by true events "" -- we've heard that one before , and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated    
or so strangely poignant  
for this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality , who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged  
beginning with their final arrest , the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris ( luke perry ) , a policeman , and pam ( ashley judd ) , a factory worker  
they fall in love and marry , but pam's increasingly erratic behaviour ( going on spending sprees , slashing herself with a knife after an argument ) begin to trouble the solid and stable chris  
when chris gets sacked , they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up  
then , chris begins to rob banks    
luke perry accomplishes the not-inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer  
moustached , with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation , he is perfectly cast as the long-suffering husband  
 ( it's another of john mcnaughton's coups of casting-against-type , after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory )  
but it is the character of pam who commands centrestage , and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness , making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person  
if the performance falls short of greatness , however , it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema , whether it's in betty blue , tom & viv or georgia  
as in those movies , there's the danger that the performance seems mannered , a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece  
judd doesn't entirely avoid this pitfall , but pam's 'craziness' is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more 'normal' chris  
when pam reacts to her father-in-law's death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones , chris' face is the picture of pained restraint  
of course , it's the question of what is 'normal' that is asked in normal life  
mcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity  
it is the rational chris that loves guns ( "" shooting is about precision , control "" ) and the 'crazy' pam that loves astronomy and yearns for a dog ( who is then called chaos -- "" chaos and you and me    
we're a real family "" , she notes wryly )  
it is chris' methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber ( his well-planned disguise as a bearded , roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness )  
in the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery , a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background : "" buy-more "" -- the perfectly respectable consumption-crazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases , and both of them into desperate situations  
it's not a perfect film  
some of the dialogue is a touch too banal ( perhaps intentionally ? )  
the use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pam's crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film  
indeed , as in mcnaughton's seminal film henry : portrait of a serial killer , it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism , the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre , that gives this determinedly unflashy , moving film its great strengths  
mcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet , coolly 'realistic' method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer  
the suburbs , with their miles of white-fenced houses and identikit malls , take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness  
in its very different way , this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malick's badlands  
while pam shares the yearnings of malick's heroes to escape from ordinary life , chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a 'normal life' - their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies  
but these are dreams defined by , constrained by , and even doomed by , the limitations of the 'normal' , conventional world  
pam's final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs , where wild bushes grow -- symbolically the frontier , the outer limits of her society , but also quite literally the end of the road , where there is nowhere left to go but to the final tragic denouement  
the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video  
 * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 
 * * * pretty good , bring a friend

1,"making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed , especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece  
when it comes to living up to expectations , a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure  
for a sequel to live up to or even surpass the original's greatness is very rare indeed  
and whereas "" babe : pig in the city "" misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe , it is a worthy companion piece  
more than that , it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like "" the godfather : part ii "" and "" the empire strikes back "" as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" picks up precisely where "" babe "" left off  
having won the sheep herding competition , farmer hoggett ( james cromwell ) and his pig are elevated to fame status  
a series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs  hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city  
in doing so , the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" flourishes where so many sequels fail  
most sequels simply rehash the events of the first film  
not "" babe : pig in the city ""  
this is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first  
also , by not being content to utilize most of the old characters , this film gives us many new ones to enjoy  
in essence , it doesn't attempt to copy itself  
instead , it strives to achieve an originality of its own  
and it succeeds  
that's not to say the familiar is absent  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film  
along with babe himself , ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride , as does mrs  hoggett ( one of this decade's best and most underappreciated comic characterizations , hilariously performed by magda szubanski )  
the three singing mice also make the journey , chiming in with their cute high-pitched vocals  
the story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice  
from there , we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne's soothingly deep narrative  
composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these  
but these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting  
while staying at the flealands hotel , babe encounters a veritable ark-full of new animals  
monkeys , kittens , and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new "" urbanites "" that babe befriends , as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter  
each character is distinctly unique , some of which are imbued with personal human-like struggles that are endearing and touching  
and while this world focuses largely on these animals , we are introduced to two new human characters as well  
mary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel , an animal-loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors  
stein's landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature  
we also meet fugly floom , an old soft-spoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel , utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions  
not having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film , it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was  
so as not to ruin this well-kept secret , i won't reveal the actor's identity here  
it was a treat indeed to see one of cinema's legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance  
the greatest triumph of "" babe : pig in the city "" is the art direction  
simply put--it bleeds creativity , taking the look of the original film to a whole new level  
restricted primarily to a farm the first time around , this second installment creates an entire city , dazzling us with unique fable-like architecture  
but the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world's architectural landmarks  
designing a skyline that includes the statue of liberty , the sydney opera house , the brooklyn bridge , the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower , ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities ( as seen in the film photo and pre-production drawing to your right ) "

1,"review : ghost dog : the way of the samurai ( 1999 ) 
cast : forest whitaker , henry silva , cliff gorman , john tormey , gene riffini , victor argo , tricia vessey , isaach de bankole' , camille winbush director : jim jarmusch writer : jim jarmusch 
rating : good shot ( stars ) 
languid , yet pointed and focused , ghost dog : the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek , ultra-cool , cinematic image of the hitman  
juxtaposing the samurai's honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the american/italian mafia , it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptor's precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber , dinosaur-like , to function in the modern era  
director jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast , ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit  
using a palate of bleached colors , jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film  
he doesn't cater to audience expectations of hyper-colorized , stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies  
the action is presented in flat , brutal codas  
bullets have permanence  
death has consequences  
the movie rises beyond standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty  
it is an anti-movie , of sorts  
there are few photogenic , empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with  
this isn't a film that lovingly holds your hand  
there are dark , contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder , just so , asserting itself for all to see  
the fulcrum for the movie's thematic balancing act is ghost dog , a mafia hitman  
a twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer , ghost dog is a hilarious contradiction in terms  
unlike the sleek , muscular killing machines one is accustomed to , we are given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly , replete with chapped , dirty hands and rumpled clothing  
he wears a hooded sweatshirt , which he often pulls over his head , giving him a monk-like appearance  
there are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal  
he uses old , worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical , efficient and pleasureless fashion  
ghost dog is a disciple of the old ways of the samurai , distilling the essence of his life through the filter of a book , which he reads daily , hagakure : the way of the samurai  
life consists of simple pleasures for him : ice cream , warm rooftop naps and good books  
ghost dog lives , as it were , by the basic tenet expressed by his book ; one should start each day considering oneself as dead  
living atop an abandoned building , surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons , ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends  
he craves nothing more  
as he puts it late in the film , "" i've seen all i want to see  "" 
he exists in a spiritual world of the mind , gaining moral sustenance from his readings  
ghost dog wasn't always as he is presented  
in several roshomon-like flashbacks , it's shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan , that "" samaritan "" being a foot soldier in an aging crime family  
ghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man , louie ( tormey ) , as repayment  
after years of loyal service , ghost dog is sent , by louie , to kill "" handsome frank "" , a made man within louie's organization who has run away with the crime boss's daughter , louise ( vessey )  
ghost dog wordlessly executes his task , witnessed by louise , whom he spares , as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon , clutching a copy of the book , roshomon  
in a bit of synchronicity , louise loans the book to ghost dog  
upset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family , the mob bosses , in turn , put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade  
the rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict  
the theme of old cartoons flares up time and again , each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog's world  
each time a character is shown watching a cartoon , it's from the same era , betty boop , felix the cat , etc  , a reflection of days gone by  
near the end , louise is watching a cartoon that's a departure from the previously shown ones  
it's a bit of audacity on jarmusch's part that is nicely effective , despite it's surrealistic nature  
as ghost dog floats through his world , his life is touched by two people  
one is a sage little girl ( winbush ) who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading  
she comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities , just as louise ultimately does  
by film's end , the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer "

1,"i rented "" brokedown palace "" last night blind , having heard nothing about it beforehand , and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws  
for anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety  
that is no easy task  
superficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably "" return to paradise "" and "" midnight express  "" 
as a result nearly every review of "" brokedown palace "" i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons  
the consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as this is a fine film  
for those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was "" midnight express "" ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of "" return to paradise  "" 
in my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad's acclaimed novel , "" lord jim  "" 
problematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world "" justice "" system  
the girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale )  
they're life-long buddies who planned a high-school graduation trip to hawaii , and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents  
once there , they find a $6 hotel and go sight-seeing , which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside  
they get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room , a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them , but they are saved from hotel security by a charming , friendly australian , nick ( daniel lapaine ) , who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl's scam  
he then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves , first toward alice , then toward darlene  
by now alarm bells are going off among viewers  
the ever-present nick is too slick and his stories don't add up ( to us ) --the girls , of course , are too naive to notice  
long before it happens , we're anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast-talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting-ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin  
just as predictably , the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison-bound for a long stretch  
left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice  
for those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl's fleabag hotel  
as one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed , the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer/fixer "" yankee hank "" ( bill pullam ) and his thai-born partner-wife  
a recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film's tag lines , "" who do you trust ? , "" and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullman's oeuvre will find few surprises  
much of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short-hand fashion  
lou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments  
is he part of a wider conspiracy ? 
with an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them  
the result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls' interaction , hank's investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension--as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape  
if "" brokedown palace "" has a major flaw , it is its creators' tendency , like time-constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half-way down and return to the story's main avenue  
and , if that were all there was to "" brokedown palace , "" it wouldn't be a very good movie  
but i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded  
for the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom--in all its permutations  
ultimately , the other sub-themes may be considered window dressing  
young and pretty , alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild , streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure  
presented as a perfect blend of yin and yang , dark and light , is her cautious best friend , darlene ( beckinsale )  
clear-eyed and straightforward , alice is more complex than her friend  
she comes from a poorer background , has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father )  
whereas darlene's life is "" on-track , "" aimed at college , marriage , kids , a career , a suburban home , middle age and "" fulfillment , "" alice's is uncertain , unfocused , and yearning  
one poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors--friends and relatives from home , whose lives continue while hers is in limbo  
tellingly , alice is present but not included  
just as revealing of their different personalities , when alice and dar first come to thailand , the openness and delight on alice's face doesn't read as simple naivet ? ; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat , reaching toward the sun , she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom , while "" dar "" remains seated in the shade  
 "" brokedown palace "" begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank  
however unintentional , it's all alice's fault  
she's responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents , to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand , to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick  
 ( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film's beginning , darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison "

1,"review : a dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in 19th century flanders  
living with his grandfather jehan ( jack warden ) in poverty , nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times ( they are renting a spare one-room cottage , and the greedy , malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them `out of the house' if they don't pay the rent )  
nello also has a rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen , in either a movie or in real life  
 ( his hero is peter paul rubens , the great flemish painter of the 17th century  ) 
not that these are the only things that make nello's life happy , however  
he has a dog of flanders , whom he names patrasche , who is a heroic rin-tin-tin of the 19th century , whom he rescues from his cruel , unkind master  
in addition , he even has a best friend ( and future sweetheart ) in the lovely , wealthy aloise , whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with `lower-class' nello  
 ( he thinks he's not good enough for her , and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying  ) 
but then , he was a poor guy himself before he married ( as mentioned later on in the film )  
one day , nello encounters a mysterious , yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande ( played wonderfully by jon voight ) , who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart , and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist  
and every christmas , there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year ; the winner getting a lot of money  
eager to save his home ( and his aging , dying grandfather ) , nello willingly decides to become an artist , asking aloise to pose for him  
one night , the two travel to a circus , where they have their fortune told ? one of the film's most delightful scenes ? that great happiness is destined for them  
she gives the kids a ring , whom nello places on aloise's hand  
 ; ) afterwards , the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers  
unfortunately , things are not all `la-dee-dah' in this tale  
aloise's father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again  
bad enough that they can't see each other ( although we know nello and aloise , don't we ? ) , but that's only the start of nello's troubles  
aloise's farm is burned down , and nello is wrongfully accused ( by the landord of his cottage ) for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise  
this decreases nello's reputation around the town , save aloise and her parents , and a kindly miller , william , who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by  
matters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies , and he has to pay for his funeral  
but then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home ( for not paying his rental ) ? permanetly  
this means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold , freezing wind  
worst of all , the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time , `the portrait of the princess' , fails to win the prize at the festival  
now nello and patrasche are really depressed , and close to freezing to death  
will nello be able to find any happiness in his life ? 
will patrasche save the day ? 
will nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise ? 
a dog of flanders is a delightful , heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages  
even older ones who consider themselves too `sophisticated' for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grown-ups , too  
there have been other movies of this ilk ( boy and dog ) , and while this one falls into that category , it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties and finding a good home for yourself  
move over ? or rather , roll over ? old yeller , this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight  
the cinematography , courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful , and really adds to the powerful drama of the film  
it also gives a feel of being in flanders ( the whole film was respectably shot in flanders )  
the music from richard friedman is also remarkable ; an evocative , poignant score that recaptures music from the 19th century  
the opening song over the credits is very beautiful ( i hope the soundtrack is available ! ) , and there's a brief excerpt of `cheer up , charlie' from willy wonka and the chocolate factory ( sung by aloise , to nello , in another delightful scene )  
the cast is first-rate : jesse james and jeremy james kissner , who play nello , are some of the most endearing , adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life ( so are the girls who play aloise , madyline sweeten as the younger , and farren monet as the older )  
not that they are the only good stars , however  
jack warden is ideal as jehan , eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character  
 ( the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming , touching ones  ) 
also , bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william  
he's another one of my favorite characters in the film  
but jon voight , as i mentioned before , is the perfect choice for michel  
he brings a mysterious , yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he * can * win the contest  
but what makes this film fun to watch is how well-defined the characters are , and the pace of the story ( best of all , it has a happy ending ? though i will * not * give it away ; sorry ) is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters  
for the first time since the beginning of 1999 , there comes a film which doesn't rely on popular formula stuff , such as big-budget special effects , commercial rock soundtracks , or any of that stuff "

1,"it's wednesday , march 27 , and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte , south carolina  
the crime : a young prostitute , elizabeth ( renee zellweger ) , has been brutally slain  
one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station  
the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority , miles away  
the police duo of braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are strapped for leads  
at the moment , they have only one possible suspect : wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy , unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act  
that's the premise for deceiver , a new thriller from the pate brothers , jonas and josh , who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave  
deceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not- so-bright cops ( captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland's iq is 151 ; by contrast , kennesaw's is 122 and braxton's is 102 )  
the setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered  
over three days , as wayland returns to answer more questions , the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until , inevitably , it boils over  
other plot elements are thrown in for good measure  
wayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can , in stressful situations , render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent  
braxton , a compulsive gambler , is deep in debt to a local syndicate  
and kennesaw is haunted by a dark , abusive side that delights in terrorizing women , especially his wife ( rosanna arquette ) , whom he suspects of being unfaithful  
the foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth's death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand : the suspect or his questioners  
deceiver , which mostly transpires in a dimly-lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue , has the feel of a david mamet play : edgy , claustrophobic , and tense  
the atmosphere is explosive , and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting  
deceiver has the power to grab an audience  
unfortunately , in the end , it succumbs to the need to throw in one last , unexpected twist , and this is its undoing  
for , while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers , it also stretches our credulity too much , and raises more questions than it answers  
it's only an effective wrap-up if you don't think too carefully about its full implications  
of course , the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic  
police procedure is totally ignored and it's almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner  
but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction , not plot details  
deceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station , and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute  
the pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth's final days and hours  
the most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice-over by visually showing what really happened  
moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks  
the movie , obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir , drips atmosphere  
there are some fascinating stylistic touches ; for example , although the setting is contemporary , all of the telephones are old-fashioned , rotary models  
cinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver's look  
some of the things he tries ( mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow ) work exceptionally well , while others ( like any of several lazy susan shots ) seem more like unnecessary visual tricks  
as wayland , tim roth gives the film's top performance , despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting  
roth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he's supposed to be  
the other two leads , chris penn and michael rooker , aren't as effective  
both play their characters like familiar types  
penn's performance is uninspired ; rooker's lacks subtlety  
some of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors  
renee zellweger , in a role that's miles away from her star-making turn in jerry maguire , brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature  
rosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw's wife , and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who's entrusted with evaluating wayland's condition  
one of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience  
plot points aren't hammered home , and , although the ending has its weaknesses , everything isn't spelled out in bold letters  
the pates give audience members credit for having brains , which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers "

1,"in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close-up of a blank movie screen at a drive-in  
we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves  
without an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind's eye  
even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema  
but do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ? 
exploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept  
is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ? 
midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth  
as joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration  
during the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne : the alamo  ' 
as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper ? but he's dead  ' 
a troubled expression comes across joe's face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone  
having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody  
joe's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream  
he romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance  
by the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing  
just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success  
but how realistic are these ideals ? 
joe had raped and been raped in texas  
the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas  
alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation  
the ability to pack up one's belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention  
schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe's abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny  
we understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame  
he runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york  
in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe's encounter with the gay student , joe buck spills ketchup on himself  
standing up , we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh  
schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe's virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation  
beyond the symbol of castration , the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin's first sexual encounter , a reference to joe's first homosexual liaison  
the fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe's emasculation  
it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients , but effortlessly attracts men  
joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff  ' 
there are two predominant images of new york  
the first is that new york is the rich , cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty  
the other new york is travis bickle's new york , a seedy , corruptive hell on earth  
joe envisions new york as the former , but is presented with the latter  
mirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine , he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men  
joe thinks he is performing a great service for new york , but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions  
the people steal joe's money , the landlord confiscates his luggage , and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity  
what has become of joe's american dream ? 
schlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party  
joe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food , drugs , and sex  
at the party , all of joe and ratzo's desires are made flesh ; joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami  
contrasting joe's daily struggles , shots of warhol's crew display wanton indulgence  
there is an irreverence in the partygoers' attitude ; we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular , orgies breaking out in the periphery , and drugs passed around like party favors  
the party makes a mockery of joe' s ideals  
joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america ; scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe's toils "
1,"much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of "" lolita , "" made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made , over its use of pedophilia , and as such , it's important to address it straight-forwardly , before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed , as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years , lying around in vaults san a distributor , and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit  
when seeing this film , after all the hoopla , keeping in mind that there are people , namely me , who are fans of the novel , who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation    well , 
you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution  
what's even worse is that seeing this "" lolita , "" especially the first time and if you're familiar with anything "" lolita , "" is admittingly very anticlimactic  
this is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film , ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it , it's really quite a film , perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne ( although , really , look at its competition : "" flashdance , "" "" fatal attraction , "" and "" indecent proposal "" ) , at least besides "" jacob's ladder  "" 
i've seen this "" lolita "" twice : the first time , i wasn't so blown away  
it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting  
the second time , not really thinking about how i've waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i'm seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre , it really affected me emotionally  
the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one , which is why it's such a good novel , and why this is such a good film  
the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a  k  a  lolita is great because it's not trash for the perverted but because it's about human obsession with things that are out of one's reach  
its protagonist , the comically-named humbert humbert , is not your average pedophile , but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies  
the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology , something that will destroy us but that we can't live without  
these ideas are all worked into this film nicely , but done in a way that is not heavy-handed at all , but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating  
the focus of this film , and the reason for making it , it seems , was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images , and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized  
the tone of the book is a comical one , but it's also a tragic one , and humbert , telling the story from his perspective , blows every single thing out of perspective  
humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires , and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed  
we get a sense that perhaps it's by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed  
he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love , and allows himself to embody her as lolita  
he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions , and by the end , he has nothing but overly-dramatic feelings for her  
the story recognizes the extreme of this , almost out of a test , seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert , and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author , vladimir nabokov , wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions , and perhaps bring them to peace  
the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end , when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey , we can easily sympathize and even identify with him  
the opening and final images of the film are the same , and who hasn't done a similar action , that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us ? 
this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen , the first time being filmed in - shock - 1962 , by stanley kubrick , who couldn't possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do , but did the next best thing : he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general  
in that film , he used the traps of society as benefits  
the studio demanded the final scene , that of a heinous murder , come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile    and 
when you see it , it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession  
the censors wouldn't allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the , um , relationship between humbert and lolita , so kubrick decided to play it as comedy , but still allow the tragedy to seep through  
looking at these two versions , especially after reading the novel ( and we all know that when we've read a novel and see a film adaptation , we are bound to be angered by any size differences ) , it's really impossible to compare them  
they both go for different things , and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was  
and although it's true that several scenes are similar , and are thus up for comparison , overall it's unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse  
i have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is , and i won't say that here  
however , this film is pretty amazing , mostly because hey , i loved the book , and this film nearly reminded me of it  
it doesn't have nearly as much wit ( a couple comical scenes , and even a lot of good chuckles , but just not totally witty ) , but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had  
some of that is in the casting of the two leads  
jeremy irons , with his deep , soft british voice and gentle look , is an amazing humbert  
he's droll in a very unique way , and , well , no one can look distraught the way he does  
he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience "

1,"the reunion film is not an original idea in any way , shape , or form  
it's been done throughout film history over and over again , and has become one of the many sub-genres , like the prep school sub-genre , the angst-filled teen sub-genre , and the slasher sub-genre  
what makes "" peter's friends "" so remarkable is not how it doesn't follow the rules of this sub-genre , but how it follows it so well , and creates characters that i wouldn't mind hanging with  
what are the rules of the reunion sub-genre ? 
well     
1  you need a group of friends , most of them married or at least dating , and sometimes even married or dating eachother  
2  you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis  
3  they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart  
4  the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10  
5  they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic  
6  the reunion has to bring them together , seperate them with little crises , then bring them back together because , after all , they're friends  
7  there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited  
8  eightly , they're all unhappy or marginally so  
9  there's some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that's built up over the years  
10  the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts , sometimes internationally so  
11  the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends , sometimes causing them to get together in dance/song  
since it follows these rules so closely , it will probably be ( and has been ) coined off as just a "" british 'big chill  ' "" 
and in some ways it is  
both follow the rules , as i said , and both feature lots of bitching , big confessionals , and broken relationships  
but while "" the big chill "" was , at least to me , a tad too whiny and unsatisfying , "" peter's friends "" hits its mark , making this film funny , dramatic , and poignant  
the friends of peter's were all in the same theatre group back in '82 , performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them ( the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus )  
after peter's ( stephen fry ) wealthy father ( richard briers , hardly on screen enough to register , but oh well ) dies , leaving a giant mansion to him , he has to decide whether or not to keep it  
not sure what to do with it immeadiately , he decides to throw a giant reunion party , inviting back all his old chums  
of course , all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule  
andrew ( kenneth branagh , also directing here ) is an actor who's unhappily married to a tv star , carol ( co-writer rita rudner )  
maggie ( emma thompson ) is a successfuly publisher of self-help books , but looks like she needs them more than her customers , as she is lonely and unhappy  
roger and mary ( hugh laurie and imelda staunton , who were also married in "" sense and sensibility "" ) are married , and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk , but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died  
and sarah ( alphonsia emmanuel ) is as promiscuous as ever , having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian ( tony slattery ) who's married and wants a divorce because of her , giving her doubts  
as for peter , things seem okay  "

1,"seen august 8 , 1998 at 6 p  m  at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam , ny ) , theater #6 , by myself for free using my sony/loews critic's pass  
[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] 
war is a topic that can't help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media  
movies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory  
it's easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other  
forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number  
 "" saving private ryan "" is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery  
it proves there's a huge difference between battling and killing  
the film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory  
it's world war ii , d-day to be exact , and the u  s  military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them  
spielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality  
instead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared  
there is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops  
 "" poor "" is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are  
there is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters  
we don't get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding  
the nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they're there  
in the movies , the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch , but in reality that wouldn't happen  
the men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies  
they are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well-secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they're shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off  
perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme  
the film seems to rely on the audience's sense of patriotism , that the american military is "" right "" and good and that the nazis are "" inherently evil  "" 
the battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50-foot progression ) , and begin to inflict some damage  
i have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up , i couldn't help but feel some sense of joy and relief  
to triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure , but there's nothing cliche about the graphic , detailed , atmosphere here because it really happened  
one of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is , and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting  
the plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet  
tom hanks stars as captain miller , a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon  
he's never obsessive or any such generic , cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this  
he doesn't want to be there any more than his men , but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out  
the mission the film is concerned with is , as the title states , saving private ryan  
through a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker , it is brought to a general's attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each's death simultaneously  
when they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe , they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother  
it's easy to sympathize with this situation , after all , no one should have to lose all their children at once  
but finding one man in this war is , as miller puts it , "" like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles  "" 
the saving of private ryan isn't just a dramatic device , but a thematic one  
his salvation represents the sense of innocence the country , the world even , was trying to convince itself it still had  
when miller's company hears of the mission , they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead , but miller isn't so quick to shrug it off  
he knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope , and now he has the opportunity to make someone's sense of hope a reality  
the mission to find ryan gives miller's group a destination , but not direction "

1,"this has some major spoilers for the film , so be forwarned  
the won't appear till later in the article , so you're safe for now  
eyes wide shot ( 1999 ) running time : 2 hours 39 minutes 2  35 : 1 theatrical aspect 
starring : tom cruise ( dr  
bill hardford ) , nicole kidman ( alice hardford ) , sidney pollack , leelee sobieski , todd field ( nick nightingale ) directed , co-written , produced by : stanley kubrick inspired by : "" traumnovelle "" by : arthur schnitzer 
this is an interesting film  
i must first off state , that you musn't believe any of the rumors of the film  
cruise is not a cross dresser , kidman doesn't shoot heroin , and there's not any scene between the two that would suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist  
the look of the film is to suggest that it follows the translation of the inspired book from the film was written  
the translation , "" dream novel , "" makes you thing that the film should have been titled dream film  
there is a noticable amount of graininess to the film  
rather than complain about it as some may and already have , see it as a style of shooting  
i would gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this and shot with as much natural light as he could  
this and the film looks like it was pushed another two stops to add more grain and brighten it slightly  
as an auteur and stickler for details , kubrick seemed to be a bit lax on this one  
the film looks great , but there are a good deal of bloopers/flubs that occur  
you see lots of boom shots ( in reflection ) and you see the camera at least twice  
16 months for this ? 
wow  
reflection is the biggest killer for this film  
their apartment and almost everything in the film casts reflections and the crew can be seen in these , some quite glaringly  
one more topic of heated discussion : i saw the "" austin powers "" version , and to be perfectly frank , unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be , you'll probably not see them  
two girls standing next to each other look a little suspicious , but i can wait for the unrated version on video to see it the way it's supposed to be  
spoilers below : 
the film itself starts with ( cruise ) bill and ( kidman ) alice getting ready for a little x-mas soiree  
they go to a quite elegant party in what seems to be a storagehouse for lighting equipment , which is actually an apartment owned by pollack  
bill runs into an old friend from medical school who is now the party's entertainment  
soon after , bill and alice are flirting with others at the party , thinking that the other has not noticed  
bill is called to help with a partygoer who has had a bit too much of a good time  
the next day , bill and alice , casually smoking marijunana in their bedroom discuss the previous nights flirtations  
they both discover that they both knew about the flirting  
bill starts talking about what women can provide in a relationship , and gets alice extremely angry  
in her hazy state , she tells of an opportunity she almost acted on to cheat on bill , not caring about the possible aftereffects  
bill gets called away when one of his patients dies , and goes to console his daughter  
when his patient's engaged daughter makes a plea for his love and affection , he is struck with images of an affair that never occured between his wife , alice and a naval officer  
he sees "" opportunity "" as a betrayal to his wife , and before they can continue , they are interrupted  
as he strolls home , he encounters a hooker  
seeing another "" opportunity "" arise , he follows the hooker home  
they toy around , but before the act ensues , alice calls his cell phone  
he breaks the date with the hooker , and heads back out into the night  
he passes a lounge and notices that his old medical school buddy is playing , so he heads in  
when he meets the friend , the friend reveals that for extra scratch , he plays these strange parties , while blindfolded  
bill is intrigued and wants to go to one  
nick reluctantly sets him up with directions and a password  
what follows this is a short meeting where bill obtains a costume for this party and meets a young girl , leelee sobieski , and her father  
the young girl has drawn his eye , but her young age , and the prescence of her father deter this from happening "

1,"shakespeare  you hardly understood it in high school  
why would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn't count on it ? 
if this is your attitude , then i'll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh's hamlet is probably not for you , and you might as well stop reading right now  
if , however , you are a lover of the bard , or at the very least are open-minded about a challenging script , read on , for there is something rotten in the state of denmark  
namely , the king has died , and his widow the queen has wed the king's brother , claudius , but prince hamlet suspects foul play  
his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother's hands  
hamlet , enlisting the help of his friend horatio , conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery     and 
the game is afoot     
the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes  
with external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england ( also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers ) , the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established  
interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers  
the hamlet castle's grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings , mirror-panel doors , and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second-story loft  
costuming is equally grand , drawing upon both history and imagination   
not quite the denmark of the 1600's , the characters' attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia , very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel  
it is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars , respectively  
in addition to directing , kenneth branagh also plays the title character  
as the revenge-driven royal heir , branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows  
from the anticipation of seeing his father's ghost , to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester , to his eventual wrath , branagh delivers in spades  
every scene truly revolves around hamlet , as much a tribute to branagh's acting and directing as to shakespeare's manuscript  
hamlet seems to be a who's who of shakespearean-trained actors , so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself  
julie christie , as hamlet's mother gertrude , and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly , as do many of the supporting players  
kate winslet as hamlet's lover ophelia , does an outstanding job demonstrating the character's plummet to the depths of dispair and madness  
richard briers as ophelia's father , polonius , and michael moloney as her brother , laertes , are equally convincing  
nicholas farrell as hamlet's trusted friend horatio , and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the two-timing rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast  
hamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible  
in some cases , this made for interesting scenes  
billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick , whom hamlet knew quite well  
crystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian , and the result is a very funny scene  
however , charleton heston , whom many might think would butcher shakespeare , is the biggest surprise of all  
as the player king , the leader of a troupe of traveling actors , he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba  
part of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story ( with sir john gielgud and judi dench ) , but this is most unfortunate , for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time  
his off-camera speaking , while gripping , sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well-voiced actor  
i wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out , and let the venerable actor have the attention  
unfortunately , there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions  
jack lemmon , an excellent actor , just can't do shakespeare  
as marcellus , the guard who sees the elder hamlet's ghost , lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him "
1,"after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project , making the third installment in the godfather-trilogy  
this new film has been underrated for no reason  
it is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla's pervious films  
it is also more psychological , pessimistic and more tragic than the first two  
the only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some "" unfinished "" developments of some characters  
the film elegantly begins with nino rota's recognizable musical score , the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael's voice as he is writing a letter to his children : "" the only wealth in this world is children  
more than all money and power on earth , you are my treasure ""  
the year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of "" part ii "" to make his father's dream come true - making the corleone family legitimate  
michael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling  
constantly haunted by the past , his only reason to live is his children  
the family has amassed unimaginable wealth , and as the film opens michael corleone ( al pacino ) is being invested with a great honor by the church  
later that day , at a reception , his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily , "" a check in the amount of $100 million  "" 
but the corleones are about to find , as others have throughout history , that you cannot buy forgiveness  
sure , you can do business with evil men inside the church , for all men are fallible and capable of sin  
but god does not take payoffs  
the plot of the movie , concocted by coppola and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines , brings the corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican  
there is a moment in "" godfather iii "" where michael says : "" all my life i have been trying to go up in society , where everything was legal  
but the higher i go , the crookier it becomes   "" 
  
visually this film is as spectacular as the first two  
gordon willis' rich cinematography , carmine copolla's beautiful composition and alex tavoularis' wonderful art direction could not be better  
but copolla's first two godfather-films were more famous for their deep , intellectual plots , tree dimensional characters and incredible acting , than for their visual perfection  
the third installment has only the plot and visuals  
some characters could be much more developed and the acting , although good , never accomplishes to reach the same height of the first two films  
the biggest miscasting is sofia copolla , who is so unconvincing and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie , that could have been grander and more emotional  
the best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino , who should have got a nomination for best actor at the oscars  
andy garcia is powerful as sonny's son , strong , focused and loyal  
violence is natural to him  
he suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family's behalf , and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was  
however both kay ( diane keaton ) and connie ( talia shire ) are useless  
and characters like vito corleone and tom hagen are really missed  
the good part is that michael is again reunited with old friends , that you remember from the first and second films  
in the third film michael has become almost like his father , vito in the first film and vincenzo resembles michael when he was much younger  
this parallel could be more interesting if vincenzo's character was more developed  
many have pointed out that making the third film , was unnecessary  
i disagree  
it is a beautiful film of great importance , completing the tragic saga of the corleone family  
the first film showed some horrible results of corleone's life  
it showed michael making a choice ; the second showed a man damning himself for his choices and feeling the impact of changing times  
a man desperately trying to keep his balance , focus , family and sanity , while everything is crashing all around him  
the third film is a terrifying conclusion - a result of michael's life  
the life he chose for himself is like quicksand - one wrong step and you are doomed "
1,"john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles  
so effortlessly that people tend to forget he's there , much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors ( anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor's face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors )  
example : the other day my mother asked me ( the expert , of course ) if there were any movies out worth seeing , never mind that our tastes couldn't be more divergent--- i'll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes , and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go ! 
was a lot of fun ( which it is ) , so i didn't see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation  
i muttered , with a little trepidation , that she might enjoy high fidelity  
she responded with her usual query , "" whose in that one ? "" 
this is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see  
if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light , a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing , and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people ( usually of the jewish faith ) fretting about in some upper east side palace  
anyway , when i answered "" john cusack "" , she replied with a rather stunned "" who ? "" , as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to  
now i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies , most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin , but i suppose it's understandable that she would not recognize the name , after all , for most , names are tougher than faces  
i showed her a picture of cusack's mug in the paper hoping for an "" oh - him , yes he's quite good "" instead i got a "" no - i don't know him ""  
at this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger ( yes , filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone ) , till i realized something : i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack's relatively bland visage , or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise , one-syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car  
cu-sack  cu-sack - no , not quite as cool  
i'm sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as "" the guy from ( add in the cusack film of your choice ) ""  
he's not a brand name , and his movies usually aren't big moneymakers , but in his own unassuming way he's kind of a genius  
with his pleasant , common man looks , and charming semi-articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90's  
from the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon  
despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it ( the schlumpy every man ) , he's a constantly enjoyable screen persona , like albert brooks or woody allen  
and he knows how to chose scripts , while the stephan baldwin's and val kilmer's seem to put them selves in everything ( the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle , and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent ) , cusack generally picks rewarding projects ( save for the unwatchable hot pursuit , a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller )  
high fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears ( the grifters , the hi-lo country ) , and it's a hit  
it was also co-written by cusack , and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy , grosse point blank  
it's not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film , but as it progresses in its meandering fashion , the movie cast something of a spell over me  
high fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non-committal rob , a vinyl record store owner , who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his "" top 5 break ups list ""  
this is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller's day off  
at first the talking-directly-into-the-camera-schtick had me vaguely annoyed , mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit , but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack's witty delivery  
he's the kind of guy we don't mind talking directly to us  
gradually the film settles into a shampoo-like tragi-comic character study , of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is ( yes it's all very existential )  
though that plot-line is mostly enjoyable , the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters , all of whom ( now this is really something ) are terrific enough to warrant their own films  
the best of which is jack black ( of the very funny show tenacious d , a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis' hair ? ? ? unfortunately that annoying smirk remains ) , an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy  
he's the kind of guy i'm sure we've all met before , a blowhard who thinks he's always right and will do anything in his power ( be it yell , argue , insult ) to hoist his opinion onto others  
but i like this guy , because of how black plays him  
the actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes , but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak ( which might be a bit of a redundant description , seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic )  
he's the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films  
 ( look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister )  
but fears and black never let that happen  
the character , for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality  
he's over the top , but in a way we can all probably relate to  
catherine zeta-jones , in her brief role , gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own "" charm ""  
tim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age-type , a character played entirely for cartoon yuks , but still manages to work its desired comic effect  
the one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy , the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle ( mifune ) , who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent , replacing it with a stilted american phonation  
i give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role , but instead of being likeable , she comes across as rather robotic , and as such it's hard to see why cusack's character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful , intelligent writer ( natasha gregson wagner ) potentially waiting in the wings  
this reminded me of say anything , where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye , and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood ( whose unbelievably more wooden then father , clint for those "" special people "" whose wheels turn a little slower )  
in fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his , though i'd bet that if laura and natasha switched roles , the result would be more effective  
high fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances "

1,"virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre  
since 'dark city' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another  
the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix  
all the films released after it , have been less successful  
david cronenberg's existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone  
and when 'the thirteenth floor' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored  
i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again  
it was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to 'the thirteenth floor'  
however , i was positively surprised by josef rusnak's latest picture  
matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood's action and effects with an intelligent story  
existenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness  
'the thirteenth floor' is somewhere in between  
instead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , 'the thirteenth floor' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding  
in a near future    on 
the thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real  
right after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered  
douglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth  
a beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence  
the first "" download into simulation "" is impressive  
it is the creator's first visit to his world , his creation  
in order to enter this virtual universe , you have to take over someone's identity , become another person  
this is called conciseness transfer , and this is part of the tragedy in the film : people "" wake up "" in unknown places and strange things start happen  
they start to doubt in their own sanity  
these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their "" users "" and creators with their sanity and their lives  
it is a frightening reality ; the fact that all the people in the simulation ( the program links ) are living out their lives , oblivious , not knowing that they are puppets in someone's fantasy  
with an appealing ( "" blade runner "" - type ) of detective story , this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present  
our modern world is metal and glass -- cold , unfriendly , impersonal  
the thirties are different -- colorful , beautiful , elegant , virile  
this contrast demonstrates a wish for change  
virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical , enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities  
to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise , to some a personal playground -- a life without any consequences  
for others - a way to start over and "" correct "" their mistakes , by living in an illusion of their past  
virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes , dreams and fantasies to life  
at least that's how it is all beginning  
but when you're waking up from your dream , the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise  
this , almost narcotic effect , soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness  
some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised -- what is real ? 
what is thought ? 
who are we ? 
if these were answered , this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made  
they are off course not answered , but posed in an intelligent manner  
the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements , since it portrays the contrast between these computer-simulated universes  
kirk m  petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour , grace and color ; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties "
1,"when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be "" you too can believe whales can fly ""  
then it was going to be "" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly ""  
then , it was going to be "" you too can believe wood sprites can fly ""  
finally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say    
there's a lot of flying going on in this film ! 
as our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in  
well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released  
part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release )  
subsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved )  
to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high  
in an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us  
after the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters  
is the format effective for the film ? 
with a few exceptions , yes  
the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven's fifth symphony  
it's hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily  
everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts  
eventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things  
though this segment isn't very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies  
the next segment is set to ottorino respighi's "" the pines of rome ""  
in this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape  
a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack  
he is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the "" oceans "" of clouds  
again , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved  
reportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size  
the cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images  
one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent  
absolutely beautiful stuff  
the third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin's "" rhapsody in blue ""  
this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york  
there's a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife  
i won't go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending  
unfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments  
segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich's "" piano concerto no  2 "" and is an animated version of hans christian andersen's "" the steadfast tin soldier ""  
a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can't see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester  
the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina  
little does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from  
the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl  
although the ending has been altered from the andersen story , "" the steadfast tin soldier "" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short  
some children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made  
segment five is the funniest of the bunch  
set to camille saint-saens "" the carnival of the animals "" , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo-yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number "

1,"the bond series is an island in the film world ; where else would we look forward to cliches , and all of the other things that occur in most of these films ? 
where else would pure escapism , a vulnerable hero , the "" talking villains , "" blatant product placement , predictable action sequences , and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a significant change ? 
i don't understand it myself , but that's what the bond series is based on  
for ( i think ) 18 films , we've mostly got the same thing over and over again , with some variation ( and a bit of change , most notably in the two dalton films )  
but even i , a king of cynicism , can't bitch about it  
and "" tomorrow never dies , "" the ( again , i think ) eighteenth bond film , and second brosnan bond film , is no exception  
thank god ! 
the plot , as in most of them , is pure balderdash , but seems to have a nice kind of edge to it  
instead of just plain billionaire psychotics , we get a rupert murdoch-esque media mogul/psychotic - elliot carver ( jonathan pryce , looking bitching with a white-haired cru cut , and always talking like he's out of breath ) , who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war  
no , this is not "" wag the dog "" - he wants a real war , between china and england , and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it    in 
comes bond  
james is sent all around the world , trying to do research on carver , fighting with his men , and running into ( on more than one occasion ) a chinese secret agent like him : wai lin ( michelle yeoh , asian action star extraordinaire    and 
co-star of "" supercop , "" nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one )  
the two eventually , and predictably of course , begin working together , and yes , there is some sexual tension between the two  
luckily , their relationship is never strained , and she never gives into his cassanova-ness until the finale  
thank god again  
in every bond film , james bags , on average , three women ( sometimes more , sometimes less - the latter being more potent towards the aids-cautionary dalton ) , and he doesn't spoil this one ( though we never see them , of course - i mean , they need to stay around a pg-13 rating )  
there's always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again , the big bond girl ( yeoh ) , and this time we have an almost-cameo by teri hatcher as carver's wife , paris , who , it seems , was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning  
yes , teri's very attractive , but she seems kind of dull  
of course , it's not really her fault ; her part is under-written , and she's only in a small part of it  
oh well  
and there are always the big henchmen , the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains  
this time we get a tall , arian-looking ( not to mention robert shaw in "" from russia with love "" -looking ) guy named stamper ( goetz otto ) , who is pretty awesome , although a bit stiff ( well , mostly his posture , really )  
and for a bit of comedy , we get a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point  
the government people have small parts , as usual , with q ( desmond llewelyn , looking near death , sadly ) getting only one scene ( in a more grouchy mood than usual ) , and m ( judi dench ) , getting more than m usually gets ( i mean , it is judi dench )  
and for no reason whatsoever , except 'cause he was so good in "" goldeneye , "" joe don baker shows up again as wade , admitting he has no reason for being there , and is this time more annoying  
again , oh well  
the action sequences are not a let-down , although sometimes go on too long  
they pop up every now and then , mainly because they have to ( for the sake of the series ) , and some significant ones are the opening one , one in a garage with a bmw that runs on remote control , and a motorcylce chase ( on a bmw cycle , nonetheless ) through china streets ( or was it vietnam    the 
plot's not really essential )  
they're more high-tech , and feature much more laughs , which , yeah , i dig  
so what if they're distracting ; they're supposed to be ! 
the acting , from most around is great  
yeoh is , actually , one of the better bond girls , mainly because she's so unique  
the better bond girls are more independent , and have a certain wily-ness to them  
pussy galore , with her homoerotic undertones and all , is one of the best , and diana rigg , who married bond at the end of "" on her majesty's secret service "" only to be killed , added some emotional depth  
yeoh is notable since she's so active , and has great chemistry with brosnan  
pryce is an awesome villain , being slimy and lovable at the same time  
and brosnan is , once again , the mack daddy  
the bond series is built on cliches , mainly because they're so fun and add to the escapism  
if you can remember the dalton years , and they're serious direction , you remember how unsuccessful they were , both financially and aesthetically "

1,"there is a striking scene early in "" city of angels , "" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise  
the camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black  
then the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up  
you see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch  
it is an important scene for several reasons  
first of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible  
the film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference  
there are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like "" angels in the outfield "" ( 1994 ) or "" michael "" ( 1996 )  
the angels here are stark and believable  
this early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god's angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air  
there is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well  
they eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven  
like human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure  
 "" city of angels "" is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan )  
he first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven  
maggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies  
angels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it's not enough  
he wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance  
he learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to "" fall "" and become human  
he learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( "" n  y  p  d  
blue "" ) in a touching and humorous performance  
sitting at a diner together , franz tells cage's character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person's skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children  
of course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it  
 "" city of angels "" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender's haunting 1988 film "" wings of desire  "" 
wenders' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened  
the americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human  
and , unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare , it doesn't suffer extensive damage  
this may be because director brad silberling ( "" casper "" ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( "" blink "" ) wanted to make "" city of angels "" its own movie - inspired by "" wings of desire , "" but not an attempt to copy it  
and yet , "" city of angels "" is not a typical hollywood movie  
it is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( "" the english patient "" ) , whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world  
seale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene , there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around , looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by  
while the film travels along a charted plot , it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are  
both cage and ryan give soulful , soft-spoken performances  
ryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch  
cage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have  
what is most striking about "" city of angels "" is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging  
it's not a formulaic hollywood ending , because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time  
it doesn't give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance  
instead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive

1,"matthew broderick and high school comedy  
the two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986  
now it is 13 years later , and broderick has another high school comedy , election , to show the world  
ferris buehler's day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows  
it was light , fluffy , tasty , and sparkling clean  
but election is far different  
this production is a dark , and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies ; it shocks as well  
jim mcallister ( matthew broderick ) is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud  
he is a kind , caring , younger man who has built his life around carver high school  
in turn , carver high school has provided a home for him  
jim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span , and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body  
tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an intelligent , outgoing , and , to quote the film , "" super nice "" young girl  
she is involved in numerous extracurricular activities , always has her hand up first in class , and is extremely popular among most of the student body  
so , it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president  
the metzler family is an extremely wealthy one  
the father , dick ( holmes osborne ) , owns a cement company  
the mother , jo ( jeanine jackson ) , is an ideal housewife  
and the two children , paul ( chris klein ) and tammy ( jessica campbell ) , are both students at carver high school  
paul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself , and is definitely a candidate for most popular person in school  
tammy is a lesbian who , to say the least , is going through a period of self discovery  
for reasons of revenge , hatred , and sexual envy , jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president  
he claims that in a democracy you need choices , and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts  
so paul agrees and the race is on  
but then , in an effort to spite the two candidates , tammy announces that she is running as well  
her campaign is straightforward : people only run to put it on their college applications , then they do nothing  
well , "" i don't even want to go to college , "" she says  
in election , there are no "" good guys ""  
almost everyone has their own agenda  
no matter how deeply hidden , the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience  
tracy is the type of person that you remember from high school  
she is the girl that would be labeled "" most likely to achieve anything she wants "" in the yearbook , and everyone secretly envied her because of that  
jim is a teacher that takes the trust that students give him as a privilege , and uses it to his own amoral advantage  
everyone , including the principal , a former teacher , all the candidates , and even paul's girlfriend are two sided characters  
that is much of this film's beauty , it doesn't have the typical good guys that hollywood likes , instead it is a realistic portrayal of the real world , specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themselves  
matthew broderick couldn't have been any more perfect for this role  
his character is often similar bill murray's award winning role in the 1998 film , rushmore  
of the two acting jobs , broderick's is far superior  
but even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon  
the hatred that she causes the audience to develop towards her , is simply indescribable  
broderick and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes  
one such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day  
you can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures , making her an eligible candidate  
and his subtle disgust with her is apparent , although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to put on a happy face "

1,"the makers of jurassic park & the director of speed conjure up a storm ! 
 ( reviewed at eng wah's new jubilee cineplex at ang mo kio ) 
 "" unlike earthquakes , their fury is precise  
unlike hurricanes , their reach is unlimited  
unlike fires , there is no way to combat them  
unlike floods , their terror is sudden  "" 
- excerpt from twister production notes 
i'm sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen tornadoes ( or twisters ) before  
i for one , have only seen the devastating effects and footage of tornadoes from news reports on tv and personally , i feel tornado-caused destruction comes no where near the destruction caused by hurricanes and earthquakes         that is until i saw twister  
the destruction caused by twisters may be precise ( not widespread but it moves very fast and its path of destruction is unpredictable  
it will suck in cars , houses , livestock , etc      
basically anything in its path that is not firmly rooted to the ground and in twister , you'll get to see all this - close up ! 
twister tells a tale about a group of storm chasers  
these people are basically out-of-their-mind and for the sake of obtaining data on twister-occurrences , they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes , trying to get as close as they can      that 
is if the tornado does not suddenly decide to change its path towards them ! 
jo ( helen hunt ) is the leader of this pack of kamikazes  
while they are gearing up for the mother-of-all-storms as predicted by satellite recon , bill ( bill paxton ) , a former co- leader of the team returns to settle some divorce papers with jo  
apparently , bill has left his rogue-ish days for greener and more practical pastures - as a television weatherman  
he catches up with his old-self and follows the pack like the good ole days , bringing his wife-to-be melissa ( jamie gertz ) along , a city-bred woman toting around with a handphone  
jo has finally implemented bills initial idea of a device called dorothy which measurement's of a twister may lead to a better understanding on how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable early-warning system can be implemented  
the problem is , the device has to be placed very near the twister , and in its path ( which is practically unpredictable ) of destruction in order for it to function  
to add to their current challenge , there is another group of storm chasers that is corporation-funded led by jonas ( cary elwes ) and they too have a similar device  
thus begins the race ; jo's cheap government equipment with beaten-up vehicles against jonas's high-tech computers and satellite link-ups with their sleek , black all-terrain vans  
plot wise , there are not really anything to shout about  
twister is as predictable as any summer box-office hit can get  
there is the danger of the twister , the competition with jonas^os more well-off team and of course , the settling of differences between jo and bill ( this part gives the film its human substance )  
helen hunt , bill paxton and the rest of the actors/actresses give only average performances and all of them take back seat to the main thespian in this movie - the twister itself ! 
thanks to the impressive digital effects by ilm ( lucasfilm's industrial light and magic ) , we get to see the terror and destruction caused by tornadoes up close ; from stripping barns and houses to lifting up livestock ! 
jan de bont once again proves his visual abiility ( thanks to his years of experience as a director of photography for action films ) for action sequences  
like his previous film speed , the tornado sequences ( which are essentially the action sequences ) are well visualised and edited  
audiences will be holding tight to their chairs everytime a tornado comes on screen ! 
the surround sound effects sure does help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister ! 
 ( the cinema must at the very least support digital sound to fully appreciate this ) twister is definitely an effect-dependent movie  
now that id4 fever has begun to reside , and people are getting bored of watching will smith whoop et's ass for the umpteenth time   "
1,"sam ( matthew broderick ) is an astronomer in a small american town and engaged to teacher linda ( kelly preston )  
he is head over heels in love and lindas sudden departure to new york city to live with her new lover anton ( tch ? ky karyo ) comes as a complete surprise to him  
but as we all know love is blind and so sam leaves for new york as well to win her back  
he moves into an abandoned house across the street from anton's apartment and installs a camera obscura to watch them  
suddenly anton's ex maggie shows up , but she does not want her former lover back  
on the contrary , all she wants to do is vaporize him  
she may say that she doesn't want to kill him , but the possibility doesn't bother her too much either  
after all , people die every day  
in spite of their different motives the two team up and fall for each other as things move on  
the story sounds like something we all have seen a million times  
but we haven't  
griffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy since "" while you where sleeping ""  
the camera obscura adds a "" special something "" to the movie and makes it an exceptional romantic comedy  
everything about the movie is perfect , from set design to casting  
the dialogues are inspired and the touches of black humor add a certain bite  
meg ryan , known from "" when harry met sally "" or "" sleepless in seattle "" , surprises in a role that may finally help her get rid of her sweet little girl image  
she impresses the viewer as a maneating biker girl  
even more surprising is the fact that the viewer believes her , much more so than in last years "" courage under fire "" where she played a gulf war pilot  
matthew broderick is the goodnatured and somewhat naive sam who has trouble accepting reality  
the viewer can tell that he doesn't only watch the stars but also tries to reach out for them  
he has trouble keeping in touch with reality  
after all , who would leave everything behind to chase a lost love ? 
his naivet ? that we don't question for a minute throughout the movie clashes with maggies exaggerated wish for revenge  
she would do anything to harm anton  
she doesn't hesitate to use sam for her plan and makes him understand right from the beginning that nothing will happen between the two of them  
that makes the scenes when they innocently share a bed , have potatoe chips and watch the action across the street like a saturday night show on tv even funnier  
tch ? ky karyo is perfect as anton  
he is , well , repulsive  
that's all there is to say about him  
you can't really manage to pity him , even after all his mishaps  
he not only took sam's bride away from him , he is also a french chef  
worlds collide , i  
e  
the usa and france  
this can only go wrong  
even if maggies revenge schemes are at times shocking , you just can't sympathize with a man who plays "" je t'aime    moi 
non plus "" on his tape deck  
not everyone is captured by the french charme that linda and even maggie fell for  
sam certainly isn't  
too bad for anton  
for him things take a turn to the worse  
 "" addicted to love "" is one of this year's most pleasant surprises "
1,"is it just me , or have disney films gradually lost their appeal ? 
i was almost stunned by the quality of "" who framed roger rabbit ? "" , a fun , unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together  
 "" the little mermaid "" harkened back to , and perhaps surpassed , the classic disney animations from the first half of the century  
however , the endless stream of "" the little mermaid "" wanna-be's is getting to me  
you know the spiel : a lame plot recycled from some well-known story , colorful , almost psychedelic animation , the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson , the comedic sidekick/sidekicks , the seemingly unattainable love interest , a few catchy songs , a few in-jokes for adults , and the occasional out of place warner-brothers-coyote-fall-off-the-cliff type joke  
it's a formula , and like any formula , it gets tiresome  
that's why i'm delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli , a japanese cartoon studio  
from what i've seen of their movies ( "" kiki's delivery service "" and the already english-dubbed and american- distributed "" my neighbor totoro "" ) , foreign audiences are in for a treat  
these movies , particularly "" kiki's delivery service , "" are wonderfully original and entertaining  
 "" kiki's delivery service "" starts with an unusual premise : kiki , upon hearing forecasts of clear skies , decides it is time for her to leave home  
this is unusual because kiki isn't a college student or a young adult making her start on the world , but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch  
her mother is also a witch , and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training , her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance  
just the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences , but no mention is made of the occult , and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie : kiki's mother acts as a village doctor , and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom  
kiki must choose a city to move to , and what she chooses is the co-star of the movie : a german seaport town , far removed from the country life she has been used to  
initially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding , she's discouraged , and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as a witch  
on the verge of leaving for a new town , she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it  
the favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courier , a one-persons delivery service  
this is where the movie becomes shockingly good  
kiki's job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her  
the townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn't seem forced or artificial , but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light  
they're three- dimensional , impossible to quickly evaluate , possessing of faults , and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl  
however , each one has something about them , some interest or trait , that makes them interesting and unique  
the personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings : the seaport town genuinely looks impressive , capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the 1950's  
this beauty is beauty with depth ; for every detail left in , dozens are only hinted at  
i could probably go on all day , but i won't ; suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie  
some of my favorites are kiki's relationship with the baker's husband : although he's quiet , never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie , and he initially scares her , his kindness wins her friendship  
in the garage of a deliveree's house can be found a vintage model t  two old ladies have a relationship evolving from master-servant to friend-friend  
such details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg  
added on top of this is a lesson on the importance of self-worth  
kiki initially seems to derive much of her self-worth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her , but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment , making her question the importance of such beauty  
this causes kiki to lose faith in herself  
however , kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings , but the innate beauty inside her  
seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous , and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i don't even want to hint at it  
the ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and , ironically , the most disney-esque moment i've ever seen ; if you don't hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention  
the movie steers free of many of the disney conventions : there is no violence , however cartoonish , no song-and-dance number , and kiki's pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick , although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes  
however , i would be surprised if disney doesn't give jiji more jokes , or at least the voice of some comedian  
refreshingly enough , the moral lesson of the movie is not self-contradicted , a habit disney movies have gotten into  
 "" beauty and the beast "" 's beautiful belle , for instance , learned that beauty was derived from a person's inside , and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing  
kiki , on the other hand , learns to separate her wardrobe from her self-image , and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film  
another difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for "" kiki's delivery service "" : not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be , but with a greater attention to realism and detail , it fits the movie to a t  this is particularly true with scenes of kiki's flights  
the extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold , and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film i've ever seen  
i'm not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states "

1,"i'm an avid fan of the "" alien "" saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it )  
of course , that doesn't mean that i'm gonna be giving this a four-star review or something , because "" alien : resurrection , "" the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were  
however , it's a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series  
in short , i had a good time  
 "" alien : resurrection "" leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre's answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one  
of course , the last one wasn't very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn't financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! )  
so back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that's a bad thing , but it's becoming a cliche )  
so she's cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called "" the auriga "" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr  wren , played by j  e  freeman , as well as the little-seen dr  gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her  
once you get past the fact that you can't figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film's okay  
also on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and    winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won't state it , but unless you've been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it's nicely covered up )  
there's a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it's never really deepened enough  
oh well  
well , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship  
and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who's death is comical yet sad since , well , he's dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth  
of course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old "" alien "" -brand fun  
the real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there's always a bit of it , most notably in "" aliens "" with the relationship between ripley and the little girl )  
what's interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach  
 "" alien "" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights  
 "" aliens "" is a wild , tense thriller  
 "" alien 3 "" is a bleak , moody piece of semi-noir  
 "" alien 4 "" is kind of like an off-beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares  
jean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like "" das boot "" has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat  
the chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there's the most tense surgery scene since "" face/off "" towards the beginning )  
and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that  
this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others  
there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed  
one is the aforementioned surgery scene  
another one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome  
the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet's earlier film , "" delicatessen "" )  
and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to "" goldfinger "" )  
but the best scene in the entire film ( i'm sure i'm not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an "" 8 "" tatooed on her arm )  
it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga  
the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters  
however , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there's very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow , we are pretty scared  
and , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : "" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! "" 
johner : "" well , i can get you off  
but not this ship "

1,"let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal  
so i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal  
i watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times  
under no circumstances , should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix  
this theater , owned by the parent company of one of hollywood's biggest studios , hasn't even graduated into stereo sound yet  
the mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age  
in other words , the sound sucked  
as someone used to digital sound in a movie theater , bad sound doesn't do anything to add to a film  
i'm not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together  
there , i've had my rant , now on with the regularly scheduled review  
which sadly won't include commentary on the film's sound which i'm assuming was spectacular , but i'm just guessing  
my guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix  
it is nothing short of stunning visually  
sadly , the rest of the film , while pretty good , doesn't quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good  
the matrix has at it's core a good concept , although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked  
keanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax  
it turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster  
now machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator , plugged into a computer network  
the computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed  
the population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose  
that is except a small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons  
they now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie  
reeve's character , neo , is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus ( laurence fishburne )  
newcomer carrie-anne moss and one of hollywood's most underrated actors , joe pantoliano , join fishburne in the band of freedom-fighters  
the action sequences are nothing short of spectacular  
this can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor's extensive pre-production training in martial arts  
this lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film  
when you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world , it all adds up to an eyeful  
as i already said , the visuals far outpace the rest of the film  
acting in the matrix is not bad , but it certainly isn't real good either  
keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances  
although to his credit , it is one of his better performances  
laurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a sci-fi action film  
more than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama  
joe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had  
carrie-anne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role  
it's nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks  
you have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film  
it was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences  
i also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue , which was terrible at times  
in more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird  
it almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie  
so they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about "

1,"director dominic sena ( who made the highly underrated kalifornia ) and producer jerry bruckheimer ( the rock , armageddon ) bring us a slick and entertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen  
nicolas cage plays memphis , a retired car thief who's "" pulled back in "" to the business by an evil car thief overlord ( christopher eccleston ) determined to kill memphis' kid brother ( giovanni ribisi )  
memphis is ordered to steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise , all while having to elude the detectives hot on his trail and a rival car thief who feels the job should have been given to him and his gang  
memphis sets out to put his old crew back together , but discovers that most of them have retired as well  
gone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits  
in that sequence , we get a rockin' little tune from moby , along with some simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects  
filmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence , and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride  
and what follows doesn't disappoint    
cage turns in one of his good performances here ( he can easily go either way    
good or bad    
i don't know how he does that ) , and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely  
of the supporting cast members , angelina jolie as memphis' former love is in the film just to provide eye candy ( she's definitely the hottest looking grease monkey i've ever seen ) and robert duvall as memphis' former mentor is just around to lend the film some class  
also , i'm a big fan of will patton ( armageddon , the postman ) and would love to see him get a huge role someday  
none of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately  
some underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles  
delroy lindo ( get shorty ) shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis , as does timothy olyphant ( go ) as lindo's partner  
i just wish some of the other characters could have been as important  
the only real gripe i have about the film though is its conclusion    
mainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll  
there's no doubt in anyone's mind that the 50 cars will be successfully stolen , and the filmmakers blew a perfectly good opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the "" rival car thief "" plot line  
as it stands , that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in a tidy little package  
but if i was making this film , i'd have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis and his crew , thereby making memphis have to improvise    
thereby adding some meat to the plot  
the finale is essentially just a big car chase , and there just aren't ways to make car chases interesting anymore  
it's all been done  
the chase is also shot and edited in that "" jerry bruckheimer action sequence "" kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene  
sure it's a car chase , but what exactly are the particulars of it ? 
it's very hard to tell  
finally , there's a stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the "" bus jumping the ramp "" sequence from speed in the "" oh , i don't think so    "" 
department  
despite those minor complaints , gone in sixty seconds is pure summer movie entertainment  
it's not thought provoking , but it's shiny , loud and fun "

the previous two "" alien "" films have each had their own unique styles to them  
the ridley scott's alien was very much a stylistic suspense film  
james cameron's aliens was much more of an action film  
and i liked each film separately for which it was  
now alien 3 is out  
and it is it's own film in the same right that alien and aliens were  
unlike aliens , alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens  
this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off  
the survivors of the expedition to lv-426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens  
the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item , an egg  
in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch , find its quarry , which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured , an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel  
this vessel crash lands on fury 109  
everyone in the vessel is killed , except ripley  
the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash  
fury 109 is an ex-mining/maximum security prison  
when closed down , some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet  
all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years  
ripley's arrival sparks a problem with the inmates  
as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner's sport , there is an infestation of lice on the planet  
being an ex-prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons  
so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own  
i will not go into detail , but you can guess what happens here  
the alien is loose and no one believes ripley's outstanding story  
she finds comfort in the arms of the colony's doctor  
yes , after 57 years ripley has sex  
it is not gratuitous , in fact , we don't even see them kiss , but it is just as well  
a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film  
there is a lot more gore in alien 3  
in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two  
it also sports a new alien with 4 legs ! 
i won't say how , but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle , which i am sure will be explored in alien 4  
sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character  
her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination  
the rest of the cast is also quite good  
notably , charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109  
alien 3 has a very distinct look  
this is due largely to its director , david fincher  
mr  fincher , who until now has only directed music videos and commercials , has done an incredible job here  
his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no "" alien "" film has before  
for mr  fincher , i see a long prosperous career ahead of him  
the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry  
elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the "" alien "" series been set in "
1,"clue is an unfairly ignored comedy , very similar to 1976's murder by death  
this big screen version of the classic board game ( what's next    
chutes and ladders : the motion picture ? ) is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue  
the plot , for what it's worth , has all the characters from the game ( in this case , the names from the game are used as aliases ) meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr  boddy ( lee ving ) , the man who's been blackmailing them all  
when he turns up dead , everyone ( including the audience ) must figure out whodunnit    
and in what room , and with what object  
while not as witty as neil simon's murder by death , clue definitely has it moments  
it has so many moments in fact that i use a lot of the lines from the film when i'm joking around with my friends  
to this day , whenever someone says the phrase "" well , to make a long story short "" i have the follow up phrase "" too late "" ready to go  
the cast ( all very good comedic talents ) play well off one another , while the late madeline kahn ( as the dark and sultry mrs  white ) sometimes steals the film away from the rest  
and colleen camp , as the french maid yvette , displays some of her natural talents as well  
clue is available on dvd from paramount home video  
it includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1  85 : 1 ( and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) and features the original theatrical trailer  
a french language audio track is also available  
the trailer holds up well considering most previews from that time do not , and it even includes a scene not in the film itself ( a scene that should have been in the film , as it's a good joke )  
also , the trailer is scored to the music from airplane ! , which was an interesting choice  
when clue played in theaters , it ran with the gimmick of three different endings  
if you wanted to see all three , you had to go to the movies three separate times  
so when the film was released on home video , rather than releasing three separate videos , all three endings were included on one tape    
the first two endings being "" what if ? "" 
endings and the third ending being the actual ending  
now for the dvd release you get two choices  
you can watch the film as it was presented on home video or you can select to watch it with one of the three endings randomly chosen for you  
 ( note : there's an easter egg hidden in the disc pertaining to this  
after watching the film with a randomly selected ending , when you return to the menu screen you will be able to highlight the large magnifying glass and select it  
when you do , a secret menu opens , allowing you to watch any of the three endings by themselves  ) 
now while i applaud the effort of paramount here , as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc , it just doesn't work well  
first , why not give the viewer the choice of what ending we want to watch ? 
maybe someone like myself who's seen the movie hundreds of times would like to sit down and show it to someone with the second ending only  
i'm no technical dvd expert , but i can't imagine that being too hard to accomplish  
secondly , the delay between when the film itself ends and one of the endings begins is too long and too obvious , thereby becoming a distraction right when you definitely don't need a distraction  
finally , the back of the dvd case states "" and now , with this special dvd version , you can see all 3 surprise endings ""  
i have no idea why they would word it that way , since that's not a special feature in the slightest  
the video has been out for fifteen years now ( good lord , has it been that long ? ) and it's played on television with all three endings all the time  
these are merely minor complaints however , seeing that i've watched the home video version hundreds of times and have no problem watching the film as such on the dvd  
the picture and sound are wonderfully improved over my worn out vhs copy , and i'm thrilled that paramount agrees with me that clue is a film worthy of being preserved on this great digital format "

1,"there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor's effort  
often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile  
when one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders  
but sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with "" the hurricane  "" 
this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin "" hurricane "" carter would normally be called "" norman jewison's 'the hurricane , ' "" as per the tradition of referring to a film "" belonging "" to a director  
but though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of "" the hurricane , "" because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington  
washington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late-night shooting in a bar  
jailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals  
the situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter  
through the efforts of that group and carter's lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted  
the film details carter's childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya )  
when he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide  
despite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned  
flash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african-american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison  
the book , entitled "" the sixteenth round , "" opens young lesra's eyes to the injustice that was carter's life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer  
lesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal  
 "" the hurricane "" leans on denzel washington  
he must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly  
it's probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter , because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be  
it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the film  
the actor's work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm's length  
we feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost  
washington's is a performance of weight and emotional depth  
he doesn't merely play angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level  
his work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor  
norman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection  
 "" the hurricane "" moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely  
jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is , and nothing is terribly confusing  
his boxing scenes , constructed with clear inspiration from "" raging bull , "" get inside the action very well , and they are believable as real sports footage  
jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform , and jewison , assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington , shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude , and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell  
jewison's best achievement in "" the hurricane "" is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard-knock life , and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again  
sadly , though , the film's chief failures lie with the screenplay , as with most of the good-but-not-great efforts to round the pike this winter  
there is much to interest a viewer in "" the hurricane , "" but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich ? d route possible , it does  
take a look at the supporting characters , for example , who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil  
carter and lesra ( played nicely by shannon , who deserves credit ) are the only real people here ; everyone else is a stereotype  
the canadians are good  
the cops are bad  
the canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey-dovey commune ( and it is a commune , despite the film's failure to make that clear ) , while every racist cop ( especially dan hedaya's ) melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room  
much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey ( "" hate put me in prison  
love's gonna bust me out  "" ) , and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made-for-tv lifetime special  
it's too bad  
the cast is game , the director does his job , and the subject matter is interesting , but the script takes the safer , slightly more boring route far too often "

1,"i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files  
first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie  
the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable  
you have to reach for a larger audience  
therefore , the movie is quite user-friendly  
altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange  
but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on  
you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera  
in any case , the answer is no  
i am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium  
however , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie  
i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new  
everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others  
i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie  
warning : major spoilers follow ! 
please do not read , to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird "" hummm "" sound is all about  
you have been warned  
the x-files is what a summer should be  
exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances  
this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank  
from start to finish , this movie does not let go of you  
when i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon  
this flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes  
in fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue  
you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! 
the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid  
you know , when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? 
so yeah , the x-files is scary  
and guess what ? 
you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster  
do not think that the x-files is a monster movie  
in fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total  
no , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series  
scully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time  
she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much  
no , this is mulder's time in the spotlight  
by now , you have heard of the scene where mulder "" showers "" independence day  
if you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let's just say that due to recent events mulder should be "" showering "" godzilla instead  
to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there    who 
cares ! ? 
if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? 
the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous  
the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill  
the script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose  
if you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! 
unlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects  
miss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense  
also , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies "

1,"there is nothing like american history x in theaters or on video  
no other feature film takes such a cold hard look at the lure , the culture , and the brotherhood of white supremacy  
nice guy ed norton jr  ( who sang in everyone says i love you ) plays derek , a twenty-year old skinhead  
dad's subtle racism grew large in derek , after gang members killed his father  
dad was fighting a fire when they shot him  
now derek keeps his head shaved and has a giant swastika tattooed over his heart  
derek is more interested in the ideas of white supremacy than in its culture of violence  
at a basketball court , black and white tempers flare  
derek channels the aggression into a game , black versus white , for ownership of the courts  
when the choice presents itself , derek goes for game point instead of the sucker-punch  
cameron ( stacy keach ) steps in to derek's life as a surrogate father  
he takes derek under his wing and nurtures his racist feelings  
keeping his own criminal record spotless , he uses derek as a leader and organizer for high-visibility racial intimidation  
derek obliges by leading his younger and dumber friends in race-motivated mob crimes  
at the bottom of the chain , derek's younger brother danny ( edward furlong , made famous in terminator 2 ) joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons , but because he admires his brother and he wants to belong  
one night three black youths break into derek's truck , which is exactly what derek has been waiting for  
outside in his shorts and his tattoo , he shoots them all  
the third would-be thief , unarmed , is only wounded  
in the key scene of the film , derek commands the kid into a position where he can be killed with one glorious , enraptured , awful stomp  
 ( the fun-spoiling nc-17 of orgazmo seems even more inappropriate , considering american history x was rated r  what sort of country is this that says sex comedies are a bigger threat to our youth than brutal , ecstatic violence ? ) 
the police arrive just as derek kills the last thief  
derek does not resist the cops , and as they spin him around to cuff him , the film slows down  
derek raises his eyebrows and smiles at his little brother in a chilling , sadistic , satisfied grin  
now in prison , derek faces new challenges  
as the black man in the laundry tells him , "" in the joint , you the nigra , not me  "" 
there is a clique of swastika-wearing skinheads , but they are not interested in the ideology of white supremacy  
they only use the symbols as a means of intimidation  
derek finds himself truly alone , truly in danger , and truly afraid  
when derek finally gets out of prison , he finds that his friends from the gang have also changed  
without derek's leadership , they have shunned the white supremacist ideology for the white supremacist culture  
it is the final factor that makes him realize how badly he's screwed up  
in the end , he spends quality time with is brother trying to undo the respect and admiration he had earlier inspired in danny  
the film ends a little too deliberately , too neatly after the unchained emotion and violent glee of the rest of the film , but it barely detracts from the overall experience  
edward norton gives an oscar-worthy performance  
although some of his dialogue seemed to be written without enough conviction , norton's performance compensated  
 ( an example that comes to mind is his pep talk before looting the store  ) 
he also captured the essence of an older brother  
he took his responsibility as a role model to his younger brother very seriously , very lovingly , both before and after his change of heart  
though clearly not for all tastes , this film is bold and daring  
the subject matter is ugly , cruel , and at times hard to look at  
nevertheless its subjects are part of humanity's great face  
kaye gives us a good look at this fascinating , if distasteful , american subculture "

1,"in intolerance , d  w  griffith told four different historical stories at the same time , cutting from one to the other  
each of the stories builds to a fast-paced climax  
in magnolia , paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others  
yet the stories and where they are going are all independent  
what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized  
each story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment ) but then lets the tension dissolve  
while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along , even though they are not in the same scene  
then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again  
it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked  
this creates some strange effects  
the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships  
the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content  
we have the story of a dying man earl partridge ( jason robards ) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends  
phil parma ( philip seymour hoffman ) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal  
partridge's young wife linda ( julianne moore ) is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies , but for an unsuspected reason  
frank mackey ( tom cruise ) runs the kinds of self-help seminar that businesses like so much , but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit-heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women's lib  
officer jim kurring ( john c  reilly ) is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place  
jimmy gator ( philip baker hall ) hosts a popular children's tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector ( jeremy blackman ) and former quiz kid donnie smith ( william h  macy )  
the film juggles all these stories for over three hours , but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily  
each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax , but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story  
the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories  
the film seems to be built around strange events and weird history , but it really has little to do with the content of the stories , though they all are connected in part by one weird event  
magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson , though in my opinion his two previous films , hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories  
it is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson's company  
john c  reilly seems to be a standard fixture  
particularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight  
here he several of the characters are mesmerizing , but that characteristic is not really used  
as studies of characters these stories are each worth following  
as well-rounded stories with a beginning , middle and end , they leave something to be desired  
but the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through  
i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale  
heavy spoiler

1,"i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials , but there isn't  
george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant , special effects-bound flicks and he has done it again  
this is the first star wars film i've seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video  
what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story , but its amazing visuals  
basically , the film's plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets  
qui-gon ( liam neeson ) and his young apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) set out with the animated jar-jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war  
when their ship breaks down and they are stranded , they find a young boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his slave mother  
qui-gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing  
anakin participates in a heart-pounding podrace , one of the highlights of the film , to get the equipment needed to fix qui-gon's ship  
however , most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy  
meanwhile , queen amadala ( natalie portman ) is frustrated and at wit's end , being na ? ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders  
there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film- even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb  
this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made  
in all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not for uplifting purposes  
despite the fun of watching the movie , the phantom menace is not without flaws  
for starters , we have the ill-conceived , moronic character jar-jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience  
what a klutz ! 
george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as , say , yoda , r2-d2 , or c3-po , but , alas , his efforts were in vain  
secondly ( this may be good or bad , depending on your point of view ) , the movie's atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic-book feel of the previous three star wars installments  
this is due , perhaps , to the utter complexity to this movie's plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here  
the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions  
i can't say much about the acting , though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway  
however , there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances- they are straightforward and , at times , stale  
natalie portman has a great presence , but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic , unfeeling ? enigma  
there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance  
jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk  
despite the inevitable faults , there is so much to enjoy about the movie  
the heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn't quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes , but they are amazing and edge-of-your-seat fun in their own rite  
the film is a treasure to look at  
the visual effects are astonishing 99  8% of the time- the awe-inspiring , mouth-opening , eye-popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius  
not since 1997's the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one  
the production design is reminiscent of the fifth element , the previous star wars movies , kubrick's 2001 , maybe even of fritz lang's classic silent metropolis  
however , all the sets are so original  
the original star wars movies can't even match the grandeur of this film's visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer- it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode  
the costumes are remarkable and have jean-paul gaultier written all over them  
whether its queen amadala's gigantic wardrobe complete with gold-embroidery and feathers , or the jedis' simple brown uniforms , the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness  
the costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie  
as for john williams' score , i don't think he's done one as complex or powerful since ? i can't even remember  
it is as epic as his schindler's list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws  
it includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films , but williams has added on , made the music much more intense and moving  
what with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie , one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed  
there is very little to hate in the film : it's a very accomplished and skillfully made flick  
it is the best "" fun "" film and the best big-budget film out today , most definitely "

1,"the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster 
the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman 
the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider  
when those observers are joel and ethan coen , the surreal becomes bizarre  
when the life is that of jeff "" the dude "" leboswki , the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of "" what'sgoingonaroundhere ""  
the marvelous sound of "" the stranger "" ( sam elliot ) 's voice-over introduces the film  
at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up  
the dude ( jeff bridges ) is described as the "" laziest man in los angeles , possibly the world "" , although he's not so much slothful as he is relaxed  
spending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doesn't have much of a life , but he's having a good time  
when asked what he does for fun , he responds "" bowl , drive around and the occasional acid flashback ""  
lebowski's passion is bowling  
when he's not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike , things just happen to him  
arriving home one night , he's beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them  
even worse , they urinate on his rug  
the problem is that the dude doesn't have a wife  
his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment  
the "" big "" lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionaire and his dudeness lives in two-room squalor  
the next day , our ragtag hero visits his namesake's mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug  
the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it's virtually the only object there  
when he's denied any money , he picks up a replacement rug off the floor  
on his way out , he runs into lebowski's trophy babe wife bunny ( tara reid ) who offers to perform a sexual act that , according to rumor , is one of bill clinton's favorites for a thousand bucks  
the penniless dude wisecracks that he's heading for the cash machine  
later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny's kidnappers  
this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes-gone-wrong sequences  
the kidnappers are impossibly inept  
the dude and his cronies are even worse  
every plan goes awry  
you can almost see lebowski's brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues  
that's the story , but to tell the truth it doesn't much matter  
there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining  
the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into  
the dude's bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you'd see on the street but , like everything else in this film , they're not quite what they seem  
walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties  
everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam  
when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won't admit it , walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet  
donny gets precious few words in between walter's screaming and the dude's rambling  
when he does , walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns  
donny is "" out of his league "" and doesn't "" have a frame of reference ""  
the film is peppered with people for whom the term "" character "" would be an understatement  
the big lebowski's daughter maude , an avant-garde "" vaginal "" artist , paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s&m mary martin  
the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers  
bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star  
most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler  
as the flamenco music swells , we see him putting on his lavender hose  
the camera pans up to an all-purple skin-tight bowling outfit with "" jesus "" ( pronounced with a "" j "" , not an "" h "" ) embroidered on the pocket "

1,"titantic , writer and director james cameron's much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ? 
as a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful  
if you've already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again  
the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world's most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers  
in either case , it is filmmaking at its best  
when we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long  
he said no but that the time would go by so fast she'd never notice the length  
amazingly , he was right  
titanic is one of the few long films that doesn't suffer because of it  
the lush picture , filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm , opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean  
fortune hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) leads the expedition looking for the world's most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship , known back then as "" the ship of dreams  "" 
the necklace's hundred-year-old former owner , rose dewitt bukater ( gloria stuart ) , finds brock to tell him her story  
although almost all of the movie happens in flashback , one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk  
using a computer simulation , the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later , which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing  
after twenty minutes , the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage  
in a classic movie theme , the two parts of the ship , first class and steerage ( third-class ) exist in sharp contrast  
the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing  
entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance , cal hockley , played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane  
and thanks to a last minute winning poker hand , an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class  
even with her own promenade deck , rose feels trapped on the ship , what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes  
in contrast , jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board  
after jack saves rose from committing suicide , they start a brief but impassioned love affair  
never tawdry and rarely explicit , their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story  
leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma  
in so many ways , small and large , he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part  
when he confronts cal , for example , he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal's supercilious put-downs  
kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose  
the chemistry between these two academy award nominees , him for what's eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility , is nothing short of astonishing  
from the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship's bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude , they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances  
if the film breaks after an hour and a half , which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up , you will still get one of the best films of the year  
peter lamont's sets are more than authentic  
one scene , for example , starts with the planning-to-retire captain , played with insouciance by bernard hill , having his tea on deck  
it then shifts to the ship's massive gears and then to the bright-hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals  
the handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner  
easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest  
at first , since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull , not some big gaping hole , the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else  
what a lark  
we've struck an iceberg  
now let's get back to our brandy and cigars  
the ship's musicians play like troopers through it all , even after the panic sets in  
after all , they see it as their duty to calm the passengers  
when the musicians are about to die , they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together , and they mean it  
their civility borders on insanity , but it is touching nevertheless  
the story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface "

the picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding  
as they make their way down the street , a sniper shoots the mother of the bride  
yet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war  
in this scene , we meet joe flynn ( woody harrelson ) , an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church  
joe is cocky , but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesn't even know  
his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson ( stephen dillane )  
michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the world's lack of interest  
henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mother's death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread  
he decides to take action when a united nations' delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth  
henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines  
he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult  
during his visits , he befriends a pre-teen girl , emira ( emira nuseric ) who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner  
he promises to get emira out of harm's way if he gets the chance  
after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children , henderson loses hope  
however , his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina ( marisa tomei ) and her children's aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans  
unfortunately , only babies are wanted for adoption , so henderson pledges to take emira to england  
the group of children , nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy  
can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps ? 
the movie was beautifully and sensitively made  
director michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred  
they show the destroyed lives , families that have been split up , and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with  
this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson , his producer and flynn have befriended  
the group of twenty-somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life's simplest pleasures and amenities  
one of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth  
like the rest of those deeply effected by the war , this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live  
winterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room  
the picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the 1984 olympics  
winterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities  
this portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies  com 
selection mad city  
we watch them struggle to cover the horror , while trying to remain professionally detached  
however , they are human and question the reason behind it all , why no one cares , and how they can get out  
stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson  
he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events  
dillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy  
henderson realizes that he cannot save the world , but he can help a few  
it is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis leary-sandra bullock disaster two if by sea  
woody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest , most versatile actors of his generation "
1,"mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence  ) 
with three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest "" hot properties "" in action adventure stardom , and it's just about time  
for over twenty-five years , jackie's been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy  
 "" drunken master "" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to "" make it big "" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong  
i'm not entirely sure why , exactly  
in many ways , "" drunken master "" is similar to most of jackie's other early films , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii , "" master with cracked fingers "" , "" half a loaf of kung fu "" , "" spiritual kung fu "" , and others  
in fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories  
to be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste  
they're quite different from action movies as we know them in america  
these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together  
 "" drunken master "" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception  
 ( as an aside , "" drunken master "" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen    in 
a movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival  
at the time , i didn't really think it was anything special    but 
after having seen more films like it , it's kind of grown on me  ) 
 "" drunken master "" 's storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii and "" master with cracked fingers "" --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been "" adapted , "" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid )  
more specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka "" naughty panther , "" a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough  
after embarrassing his instructor's assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can    and 
is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively  
his father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages  
kei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all  
while escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more  
this turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu  
he assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up  
then , when he's ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu  
unfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them    
 "" drunken master "" features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others  
it's been said before , but i'll say it again--these fights don't just _happen_ , they're as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows  
in his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways  
the fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films  
whether jackie wins or loses , it's really something to see    and 
it's often as funny as anything , too  
and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at "

1,"countries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously , had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally  
luckily , movie reviewers aren't burdened with such legislation  
otherwise , small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer  
in case of star wars , 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas , the consequences would be even more severe , because that film is very special for tens of millions , if not hundreds of millions of fans  
in any case , objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews , because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best , if not the best film of all times  
those who don't usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery  
the author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold , objective standards in reviewing this film  
like so many previous reviewers , i must note that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago , and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever since  
perhaps it was childlike fascination with , until then unimaginable , wonders that happened long time ago , in a galaxy far away  
or perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the opening shots , with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation i had read before  
anyway , watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life  
and it was also unmatched for many years to come , because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas' epic  
star wars wasn't just important movie for me ( or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment )  
it was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema  
until than , american motion picture industry was in a limbo ; social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood , and new authors filled the void , mostly by using hollywood's financial and technical resources to create serious , "" personal "" or "" artsy "" movies  
as a result , audience , traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate , didn't want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen  
george lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue  
the audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm , and huge financial success of the movie , later backed by supplement industry of toys , books , comics , role playing games and other merchandise , slowly began to change the face of hollywood  
serious , adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion , and were replaced by industrial products of "" blockbuster "" philosophy  
one of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre  
until 1977 , science fiction movies were mostly in b-production domain  
in late 1960s , bigger budgets for science fiction didn't look so strange anymore , thanks to the great success of 2001 : a space odyssey  
but the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism , and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production - mostly dark , dystopic movies  
however , in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies , even among the audience that usually doesn't like it  
as a result , seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away , although some good , dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s  
after that , science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment  
ironically , the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of "" new hollywood "" generation of young movie authors who made "" artsy "" and "" personal "" films in early 1970s  
george lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 , and nostalgic drama american graffiti  
both movies were considered "" personal "" in its time , despite latter one becoming very popular  
in a sense , star wars is an also very "" personal "" film , and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it , not for it  
but unlike many "" personal "" movies of the era , its "" personality "" was in line with the wishes of the general audience  
the plot , set "" a long time ago , in a galaxy far away "" , begins in a time of civil war  
the evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic  
in order to quash any opposition , the empire had built death star , superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets  
the information about death star , acquired by rebel intelligence , is being transported by princess leia organa ( carrie fisher ) when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser  
princess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader ( played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones ) , but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots - c3po ( anthony daniels ) and r2d2 ( kenny baker )  
those two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot  
his adventure begins when r2d2 escapes , because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi ( alec guiness )  
old man is actually the last surviving jedi knight , member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force  
after some hesitation , luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess , while the old man would teach him the ways of the force  
their small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely , where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo ( harrison ford ) and his furry sidekick chewbacca ( peter mayhew )  
critics who don't like the movie , especially those who can't forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of "" new hollywood "" , are prone to point the lack of originality  
on the surface , they might be right ; lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood - westerns , wwii aviation movies , old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s ; yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa's samurai classic the hidden fortress "

1,"the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam  
 ( fitting , since the media-saturated gulf war became a pop entertainment  ) 
while driving through a long , flat iraqi desert ( in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament ) , one of the men under special forces sgt  
maj  archie gates' ( who's steering ) command requests a beach boys tune  
these men want their apocalypse now moment , only instead of surfing , they bop to the music and skeet shoot out the back of the vehicle , armed with automatic rifles  
our three kings ( okay , four ) are good fighters , but they don't necessarily take operation desert storm seriously-it's a reprieve from their hellish day jobs  
they are gates , new father sgt  
troy barlow ( wahlberg ) , sgt  
chief elgin ( cube ) , and pvt  
conrad vig ( music video director jonze )  
at story's start , president bush has declared a ceasefire , and american troops are tying up loose ends  
barlow , elgin , and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an "" ass-map "" that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion  
gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation ; he proposes-demands-that barlow , elgin , and vig join him on a treasure hunt  
ditching his escort , a relentless reporter named adriana cruz ( nora dunn ) , is easy  
so is finding the treasure , until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq : saddam's men are threatening the dictator's detractors ( citizens of his own country ) with violence  
when gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck , ready to loot , the unarmed rebels want help  
 ( bush encouraged them to rise up against the government , but provided no military support for such cause  ) 
gates convinces the vault's guards that this is a post-war mission , and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck  
the situation could go off without a hitch : the former enemies bear no grudges  
but the money hungry gates has a conscience , and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene , he orders barlow , elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces  
the result : barlow is kidnapped , and the filmmakers imply that these would-be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime  
barlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking device  
his interrogator lost his family to the bombs , and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child  
 ( he does , in chilling , lasting images  ) 
i liked these scenes best , because the political became personal  
it's one thing to champion the plight of thousands ; it's another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib  
russell has shocked us before : his first film , spanking the monkey , is about a young man's affair with his bedridden mother  
 ( it's great  ) 
his second , flirting with disaster , features a character who has an armpit fetish  
one could argue that it's easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions , though ; russell disturbs us in three kings by being no-nonsense about the violence  
when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home , russell mutes the sound-we're paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast  
three kings is russell's first visually arresting picture  
stylistically , it stands apart from other war dramas  
newton thomas sigel's cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy , which is , of course , entirely appropriate  
one practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen  
 ( a friend enthusiastically added , "" it's like having sand in your eyes  "" ) 
this also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade  
 ( three kings was shot in arizona , california , and mexico  ) 
russell throws plenty at sigel's camera for it to observe-as was the case with russell's previous efforts , the most absurd moments are also the film's most realistic , even the most poignant  
 ( we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside  ) 
if anything , three kings settles down and stops surprising us  
its climax is pure hollywood , no doubt the answer to why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indie-minded russell "

1,"capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii , life in a japanese prison camp  
to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity  
the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone's taste  
 , +3 ( -4 to +4 ) 
more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way  
this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law  
during world war ii , of course , the one goal was winning the war  
this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal  
when the japanese had captured prisoners , they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal  
minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output  
while the germans , not known for their kindness in those days , had a 6% mortality rate among captured prisoners of war , the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27%  
the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad  
that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do  
the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day  
and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll  
in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany  
filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story , perhaps for fear of offending the japanese  
there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps  
certainly there was david lean's the bridge on the river kwai  
there were some low-budget british exploitation films and that was about it  
then there were tv series "" a town like alice "" and "" tenko  "" 
lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa  
it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university  
the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them  
the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad  
it turns out to be a grim joke , one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves  
beating and torture are commonplace events  
men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable  
however , unlike as in kwai , the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital , called by the prisoners the death house  
so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail-laying machine  
this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies  
the japanese believe that the individual is nothing , that conformity to group's norms is all that gives a life meaning  
conformity is purpose  
before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp  
if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story  
if the british ( with one american , by the way ) and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story  
it is neither  
it is a stirring and believable account of camp life  
the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow  
this serves a double purpose for cunningham  
it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat  
it also creates a distancing effect  
the only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music  
this is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience "

1,"the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible  
people may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized , methodical hatred  
five concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days , the first documentary from steven spielberg's survivors of the shoah visual history foundation  
the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry  
as the introduction explains , even as germany started to lose the war , the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe  
in 1944 , hungary had the last big population of jews within germany's reach , and they became the last target of hitler's "" final solution  "" 
each of the five tells his or her story  
their stories are intercut chronologically , starting from normal life in pre-war hungary  
they recall the nazi invasion of hungary , being sent to "" work "" camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps  
they recall their horrible , precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald ; the deaths of their family and friends ; their loss of hope  
each recalls his or her unfathomable , eventual liberation  
and finally , the last days shows their cathartic , pained , modern-day return to their old homes and the camps  
needless to say , their stories are horrifying , amazing , and emotionally draining  
by themselves , the stories would be forceful testaments , but by cutting them in parallel , their impact is multiplied by five  
the last days is a talking-heads style documentary -- it's mostly pictures of people telling their stories , intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage  
in this kind of movie it's almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on-screen , but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific , or at least relevant , images to go with his subjects' narration  
the liner notes ( one of the many nice features of this dvd ) indicate that there is some never-before-seen historical footage in the last days  
it's not clear which scene it is  
it could be one of two that i hadn't seen before , both powerful  
one is rare color footage , shot by an american , of piles of victims in cattle cars  
there is something jarring , something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color , when so much of the footage from world war ii is in black and white  
another segment shows walking skeletons ; survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore  
there has been a glut of holocaust movies and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say  
but by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war , moll told a specific part of the story in a new way , in greater detail  
and i'm glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject  
the transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful  
x-mozilla-status : 0009f words for a holocaust documentary , but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring , when skies are blue and trees are green  
also , the movie was shot on 35mm film ( and not video ! ) , 
so the richness and detail are impeccable  
the dvd's features are plentiful and well-chosen  
there is a theatrical trailer for the movie , which is a great introduction to the subject matter  
there are about fifty still photos , both from the production crew and from the private collections of the survivors  
also , the disc has two complete versions of the movie ( widescreen and full screen ) , both on the same side  
one of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors ( plus one for the crew )  
you'd think outtakes would be inappropriate in a holocaust documentary , but they're not bloopers  
instead , they are solid , moving segments that were probably cut from the film only for length  
one of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film  
renee firestone ( one of the five ) spoke on camera with dr  hans m ? nch , a german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz  
firestone was aggressive , questioning the doctor about what his children thought  
the doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable  
another of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz  
he ends his prayer by saying ""  "

1,"alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters  
i saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i didn't like it  
of course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault  
in order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor  
james cameron's aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series  
i am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality  
many thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action  
both are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well-written  
as for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion  
perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped  
on the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn't see  
it was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh  
i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities  
don't get me wrong--i'm not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting  
however , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters  
as a result , alien 3's only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters  
we never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie  
there were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt  ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films  
the other character was dr  clemens ( charles dance ) , but because we like him , the inevitable occurs  
alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off  
the prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry  
without using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film  
an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card  
we see lt  ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments

1,"if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it's their predictable endings  
the devil's advocate has the atypical hollywood ending , when everything that should happen does  
unfortunately for the devil's advocate , this ending nearly collapses in on itself , and ruins the entire film  
nevertheless , the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment ( note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film )  
i don't think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan  
well , it does contain this element , but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that )  
the devil's advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session  
kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl  
he ends up with a not-guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo )  
he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury  
he accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife  
after proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer  
he graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god  
he is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck  
his life seems to be on the rise  
and of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline  
he is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment  
mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted  
meanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t  nelson ) who apparently murdered three people  
he spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane  
all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself  
after a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin's wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends  
a fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin's real father  
is it all just a big nightmare ? 
or is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin's life ? 
the devil's advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don't expect  
is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ? 
if so , the devil's advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early  
i went into the devil's advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got  
i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got  
but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn't like the ending ? )  
the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you  
films like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less  
we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way  
the devil's advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all  
if that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again  
as for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study  
the film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that )  
and then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur  
it was at this point that i felt cheated  
taking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film  
everything occurs from his perspective  
he is our representation on screen ( sort of )  
but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game  
i don't want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself "

1,"there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have , but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason  
 "" good will hunting "" is about one of those people  
the will hunting of the ( horrible ) title ( let's face it , this film would be a bitch to title ) , played by co-writer matt damon , is a mathematical genius  
he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino  
and he works at mit    as the janitor  
one day , the professor of one of the most challenging courses , proffessor lambeau ( "" breaking the waves "" 's stellan skarsg ? rd ) , puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete  
the next day , it's already done on the board , but no one in his class claims to have done it  
so lambeau puts another problem on the board , this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove  
and , duh , it's done again  
of course , they catch the guy who did it red handed - will  
before lambeau can find will again ( he ran away when he caught him ) , will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court , and struck a police officer , so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements : a ) he work with him on math , and b ) he get some therapy  
after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another ( for a hypnotist , he fakes being under his spell , then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic , "" afternoon delight "" )  
finally , lambeau's old college roomate , sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , a psych professor , agrees to treat him , and the two begin a rocky relationship , as sean tries to get will to open up  
turns out will had a rough childhood , being abandoned , and placed in foster homes and what not  
it also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life ; he wants a challenge  
and that is to hang out with his buds ( including the other co-writer , ben affleck ) , and do honorable jobs , like construction  
is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky ? 
should this guy be forced to do something he doesn't want to do ? 
this appears to be one of the million questions in this film , which is jam-packed with greatness , but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should  
i'm not saying "" good will hunting "" is a bad film at all  
it's a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments , and lots of great things about it  
the acting is amazing , with two oscar-nomination-worthy performances from damon and williams , who have amazing chemistry together  
we also get some great support from stellan skarsg ? rd ( great name ) , ben affleck , and from minnie driver , who plays will's love interest , skylar  
there are tons of individual moments that i adored  
i loved all the comedy in the film , especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks , his various attempts at therapy , and of course , my favorite scene in the entire film , the one where he delivers a long , exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them  
i liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends  
there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch  
and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable  
like the break-up scene between will and skylar , will and sean's first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn't regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter  
however , the main flaw of the film is there's too much of everything , and not enough of it either  
the film tries for deeper relations between the characters , but they're sometimes either overwritten or underwritten  
take for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father/son as well as doctor/patient relationship going with out any problems , but when it tries to show them as equals , it falls on its face  
we hear how they went to the same town , and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times  
but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do  
also , will's relationship with his best friend , chuckie ( affleck ) , has a nice climax , but not enough rising action  
we see them joking around , but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them , it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one  
their relationship never goes beyond "" just best friends , "" and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more    human  
maybe it was just me  
and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau , but that , again , is underwritten "

1,"why do so many children's films treat their target audience with utter contempt ? 
too many of those who write or direct for children's movies assume that the kids just can't handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues  
 "" the iron giant , "" which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as "" the simpsons "" and "" king of the hill , "" assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time  
 "" the iron giant "" holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that's enjoyable for both children and adults alike  
hogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine  
after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception  
he comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food  
after saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts  
because of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy  
realizing he can't just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr  ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time  
it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can't keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security  
he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth's house as a lodger  
meanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind  
 "" the iron giant "" is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn' t talk down to its audience  
the story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy  
it's very similar to the spielberg classic "" e  t  , ' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of "" the iron giant  "" 
the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg's film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy  
the film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one's ability to choose one's own fate  
hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero  
the final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won't give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed  
the animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after "" tarzan "" ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you're watching a cartoon  
the giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way  
the characters' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief  
fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother  
harry connick jr  does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv's "" frasier "" ) as an army general called in by agent mansley  
unlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn't ditched )  
dean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations  
even the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia  
a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won't mind , but "" the iron giant "" has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off  
the film isn't only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though  
it's also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy  
the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on "" the simpsons "" for many years  
a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to "" outlast "" one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever  
the film even takes some jabs at america's nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to "" duck and cover "" in the event of a nuclear attack  
 "" the iron giant "" has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing  
instead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with  
when you get right down to it , "" the iron giant "" is no more than the story of a boy and his robot  
the story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming  
though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go  
it's akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it's not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which "" the iron giant "" has in spades "

1," "" say , any of you know how to madison ? "" 
--- brad "" asshole "" majors ( barry bostwick ) shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show  
the story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend  
in the early 70's , stage actor turned first-time playwright richard o'brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b-movies he had grown up with as a child , set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design  
the result was the stage play the rocky horror show , which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england  
the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later , in october of 1974  
the film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975    
and immediately tanked at the box office  
whether it was because fox wasn't quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn't quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop  
it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters  
a year later , something entirely strange and magical happened  
prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film  
this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time  
word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show's life as the ultimate cult film was born  
for the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton  
brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed  
they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr  everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home  
remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance  
the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet-stocking wearing mad scientist dr  frank-n-furter ( tim curry )  
frank-n-furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood )  
as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank-n-furter's mad schemes  
little do any of them know that the doctor's handyman , riff-raff ( original author richard o'brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth  
going back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has  
if i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i don't think i would have known what to make of it either  
for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film  
by the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o'brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b-movies his film is based on  
when i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity  
it goes without saying that the "" time warp "" is the most popular song in the film  
even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song  
what those who haven't seen the movie don't know though , is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment  
my personal favorite is "" over at the frankenstein place "" , but "" dammit janet "" is also maddeningly catchy  
tim curry's vocals on the rocking tune "" sweet transvestite "" need to be heard to be believed  
the finale of the film , a big floor show staged by frank-n-furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets ( including barry bostwick    
frightening ! ) , features no less than four songs ( "" rose tint my world "" , "" don't dream it "" , "" wild and untamed thing "" , and "" i'm going home "" ) , all of which are immensely singable  
the film's true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though  
despite the catchiness of the songs , this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn't have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show  
watching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans ( unless you don't mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place )  
note : director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film , in the form of a sequel , resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment , which picks up with brad and janet ( this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper ! ) as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton "

1,"i know that "" funnest "" isn't a word  
 "" fun "" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective  
but that's the word that came to me right after viewing "" chicken run  "" 
no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like "" that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! "" 
so to hell with webster's -- "" chicken run "" is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while  
i can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner  
the chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something  
living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box  
one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer  
rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs  tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan  
she orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , "" chickens go in ; pies come out  "" 
what sort of pies ? 
chicken pies , of course  
co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : "" creature comforts , "" "" the wrong trousers , "" and "" a close shave  "" 
the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures  
part of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new  
 "" the wrong trousers , "" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and "" a close shave "" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories  
but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived  
now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in "" chicken run  "" 
the plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement  
thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done  
part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? 
park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is  
but they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us  
another thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing  
there are references to "" the great escape , "" obviously , and "" stalag 17  "" 
the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both "" raiders of the lost ark "" and "" indiana jones and the temple of doom  "" 
there's even a nod to "" the blues brothers , "" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history  
the "" braveheart "" reference is a hoot if you catch it  
when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , "" chicken run "" is downright brilliant in its execution  
consider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of "" blair witch project "" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online  
out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome  
why ? 
because once you got past the thought that "" they're parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch' movie , "" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose  
they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing  
conversely , "" chicken run "" doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene  
if you've never seen "" indiana jones , "" the chase sequence is still fun  
even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character  
park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , "" chicken run "" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either  
enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , "" chicken run "" is that much richer  
the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them  
ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on "" absolutely fabulous "" ) nails it  
she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer  
the characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived , but sweet  
poor mr  tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help "

1,"the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber , the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse , and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest , little caper adventure entitled `where the money is  ' 
the elderly bank robber is henry ( paul newman ) , a famous criminal that was only recently caught  
he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune  
always the shrewd thinker , he begins working on a plan to get out of jail  
this involves years of studying buddhism and self-hypnosis  
when he is prepared to execute his plan , he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke  
now a seemingly twitching vegetable , he is temporarily transferred to a state-run home  
carol ( linda fiorentino ) is the nurse that cares for him  
she's a very bright person with a good heart  
yet , her life is a miserable waste of time  
the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars  
her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics  
worse , she's in a dead-end relationship with high-school sweetheart wayne ( dylan mcdermott )  
they became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom  
to her , this made sense long ago  
but now , it's a different story  
wayne seems equally bored with his life , but is content enough to stay put  
wayne's greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman  
carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients , but she's never been anywhere else and doesn't see many other opportunities in life  
however , when henry falls under her care , her outlook begins to change  
the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke  
carol , however , begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all  
maybe she can get through to him , and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away  
the opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry ? back to life  ' 
and what are some of carol's resuscitation techniques ? 
perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses  
if that fails , maybe she'll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20-foot high pier into the cold lake below  
when he finally comes out of his state of self-trance , the movie's direction changes , though it remains equally if not more entertaining  
carol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness  
she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy  
this , of course , puts wayne in an odd situation  
henry and carol's bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car  
henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash  
meanwhile , this is carol's ticket to a better life  
wayne is uncomfortable with the situation , but helps out nonetheless  
however , his lack of commitment threatens their success  
the heist sequence is suspenseful , well paced , and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong  
`where the money is' does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist  
newman is the real joy of the film , adroitly showing that at age 75 , he's still really hot stuff  
he possesses a sly smile , displays a dominating attitude , and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive  
fiorentino is also a fun presence  
you root for her despite her sense of amorality  
sure , she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken man into a lake , but we can see that to escape her dead-end world , she needs to do something drastic  
with two charismatic characters such as these , it's hard to ignore that `where the money is' is where the fun is "
1,"written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes ) 
directed by robert altman 
some time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel  
the novel was a summer smash , topping best-seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads  
the only problem : the novel wasn't very good  
it was far more pulp than pulitzer  
but the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller  
so he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen  
the director ? 
francis ford coppola  
the book , of course , was mario puzo's the godfather  
the rest , as they say in showbiz , was history  
by bringing up the godfather , i don't mean to suggest that robert altman's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness  
but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material  
can you get any more questionable than john grisham ? 
depends on whom you ask  
but there's no question that grisham's work grabs people  
like puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can of spam  
so something in grisham's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america's greatest living filmmakers  
the result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon  
>from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe  
this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch  
witness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear  
we roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone  
right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises  
pay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman  
this is what a great director can do for questionable source material  
the sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases  
magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office  
outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen  
driven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home  
there he learns more about mallory's life than he bargained for  
her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski-style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter  
magruder , perhaps influenced by mallory's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed - right after he sleeps with her , of course  
this simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end  
he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well  
but then dixon's crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger  
the cops won't lift a finger to help a liberal attorney  
his only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private-eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr )  
if this predicament wasn't bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos  
altman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh's performance holds the gingerbread man together  
an accomplished actor when he isn't directing himself in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives

1,"look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future  
some sort of decision had to be made , and , for better or worse , it irrevocably altered the course of your existence  
>from time-to-time , everyone thinks about the roads not taken , and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different  
perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train , for example -- could have an equally profound , yet less obvious , impact  
maybe that's where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ? 
film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that's why there's no shortage of movies about this subject  
the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance  
these themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red  
however , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life  
in his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : "" [the idea is] rich and interesting ? that every day we're faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we're completely unaware  "" 
while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra's it's a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths  
the "" road not taken "" approach isn't just a plot device , either  
writer/director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses/catches a train  
the audience watches , with ever-growing fascination , how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family  
as her separate destinies diverge and then re-converge , she becomes two completely different individuals  
that woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit  
one day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day  
the scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform  
in scenario #1 , she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station  
on board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty  
minutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn )  
in scenario #2 , she misses the train and , shortly thereafter , is the victim of an attempted mugging  
she doesn't meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry's infidelity  
juxtaposed one against the other , while sharing many places , cues , and characters , the two stories proceed in parallel from there  
on one level , for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate , sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience  
but , for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting , a script with a few twists , and a great deal of genuinely funny material , sliding doors still fits the bill  
one of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences -- those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures , and those who could care less  
it shouldn't come as any surprise that the acting , at least from three of the four leads , is solid  
paltrow , who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same , yet gradually become much different , is the standout  
she plays both of her roles effectively and believably -- the shy , insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated , platinum-blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man  
john hannah , known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral , is instantly likable  
john lynch , taking a break from movies about ireland's troubles , does a good job presenting gerry as a inept , selfish philanderer  
only jeanne tripplehorn , who plays an over-the-top vixen , seems out of place  
her attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring , and it's occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element  
one member of the supporting cast deserves special notice  
douglas mcferran , who plays gerry's best friend , russell , is an absolute delight , stealing every scene that he's in  
part of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie  
on one occasion , he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy  
on another occasion , while laughing at gerry's plight with the women in his life , he comments , "" being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable  "" 
but it's not all in the dialogue  
mcferran tears into this part with relish ; his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top-notch comedy  
this is the first feature film for peter howitt , and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb  
the script is shrewd and inventive , combining wit , romance , and intelligent melodrama into a crowd-pleasing whole  
sliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies , however "

1,"i was born in 1970 , which makes me barely old enough to remember bell buttons , 8 tracks and disco  
however , since i was 17 years old i've seen more than my share of adult films  
i mention this only because i thinks its important to state up front that i'm not against pornogrpahy  
i've seen enough of these films to know the range of content and quality available  
director paul thomas anderson's boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema , the mid to late 70s  
this was the period when x-rated movies were real movies , shot on film , shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics  
this was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films , films that attempted to tell a real story  
one of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how , like in an any other billion dollar industry , the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete  
in this case , the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette  
burt reynold's manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur , known as jack horner  
horner's has a steady "" family "" of performers , some of whom live in his plush l  a  home  
but in the world of porn , performers are a commodity - the fresher , the better  
when horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque , he decides to add him to his stable  
it is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his  
as directed by anderson , the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door  
boogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l  a  's hardcore film scene  
but the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends  
the downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut  
by the film's final image , what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams  
boogie nights is not about sex  
it does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers  
in fact , the film isn't really about pornography at all  
pornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own sub-culture to find acceptance of who they are  
the film goes to brilliant , often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world  
yet , like in the lauded tarantino films , these people still have their own moral code , their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively  
the characters we meet are like a road map of dysfuntion  
first stop , the den mother ( julianne moore ) in denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody of her son  
second stop , the cuckold crewman ( william h  macy ) who keeps discovering his wife having sex with anyone and everyone ( the wife is played in hilarious cameos by real-life porn star nina hartley )  
but the driving force behind the plot is 17 year old eddie adams  
eddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it  
with no real ambition of his own , he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame  
his alcoholic mother , clearly dissatisfied with her own lot , abuses him verbally and drives him out of the house  
horner introduces him to amber waves ( moore ) who immediately adopts him , a nuclear family is born  
the surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her "" babies "" provides some of the films most poignant scenes  
clearly , she is not even fit to manage her own life , let alone nurture these lost children  
but the need to love and be loved is so strong , they easily ignore the dangers of the less subtle addiction she introduces them to  
even the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in a real family  
then again , perhaps its not so different from real families at all "

1,"playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task : they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare's works  
they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare : i mean , really , who doesn't think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate , introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter ? 
stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare , and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare  
and , despite the difficulty of their task , they have succeeded  
shakespeare in love is one of the smartest , funniest , most touching films of the year  
it's so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors , but here we have a movie that defines success : it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written  
it could have been a smug , self-important movie that panders to die-hard shakespeare fans , but the appeal of this film is almost universal : if you've ever read a play by shakespeare , or know anything about his life , it's likely that you'll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love  
joseph fiennes , brother of ralph , stars as shakespeare himself ; he's a delightful , irresistible lad , concerned mostly with women and detached from life's more serious problems ( debt , plague , etc  )  
he's commissioned to write plays for various people : queen elizabeth ( judi dench ) wants comedies , while local slimeball philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann ( tom wilkinson )  
shakespeare , however , has trouble focusing on his work  
he begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo and a girl named ethel  
this all changes , however , when he meets viola de lesseps ( a radiant gwyneth paltrow ) , a young heiress set to marry the financially-oriented lord wessex ( colin firth )  
shakespeare instantly falls in love with her ; he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo  
he discovers her identity and confronts her later ; she , of course , falls in love with him , although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex  
but she continues to act because she loves shakespeare's writing so much , and soon the production ( which later becomes romeo and juliet ) is set to be performed  
shakespeare in love is an amazingly good film , not because it works as great entertainment , but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter  
i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role : he has such searing optimism and energy ; he's clearly a man who admires shakespeare , and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character ( inability to turn away from women , attention deficit disorder ) , we sense a great deal of affection and care  
he practically overflows with passion in every scene  
fiennes is matched by paltrow ( whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from ) ; she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i've seen her in  
the two performers work perfectly together , taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic , and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh  
of course , it doesn't hurt that they have a masterful script to work with  
stoppard , whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film , is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor ( all of his plays have similarly dry humor )  
the first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet  
one of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play ; in the movie , shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid  
director john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor -- scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director  
i'm going to have to see the movie again ; i'm certain there are numerous references that i missed  
in fact , i doubt it's possible to gather everything with just one viewing  
stoppard is a master of detail : you'll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film , not as lines of a play , but as dialogue , suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time  
there's also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe ( and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly-homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself ) , proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe's mysterious death in a pub  
there's also a scene featuring a wide-eyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing  
 "" there's no dog in this play ? "" 
 "" no ! 
no dog ! "" 
the ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year  
geoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe ; wilkinson is also hard to recognize , but has a great role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously  
ben affleck , playing one of the actors in the company , shows great range , both in his accent ( his is almost as good as paltrow's ) and in humor ( he has some of the best one-liners in the movie )  
colin firth , always stuck playing the sap , does a good job being hateful  
judi dench , however , has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth : rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words  
my single , minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end  
the story is moving , but there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes  
but my quibbling is not important  
what is important is that i acknowledge the quality of this picture , the sheer skill with which it has been written , acted , and produced  
shakespeare in love tries so many things , and nails every one of them : it's a film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him , a film in which the actors , writers , and director are all perfectly in sync  
it's also a movie that has the potential to introduce a lot of people to shakespeare's work in a positive way , without seeming condescending or superior  
i admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly , but because it has lofty aspirations and succeeds in them  
not just any film can poke fun at shakespeare and get away with it "
1,"it was with great trepidation that i approached +mary+ , the farrelly brothers+ latest film  
i knew the film would be funny--the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see  
but i also knew the film would be an equal-opportunity offender , attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon  
i figured the film would be raunchy , maybe another lucky escapee from nc-17 hell  
i may laugh , but would i feel better in the morning ? 
i needn+t have worried  
+mary+ is the sweetest , warmest , all-out laugh-and-grossfest this side of _animal house_  
surprisingly , the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side , and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers  
they make laughter , the toughest job for a filmmaker to do , look easy  
the plot is typical  
thirteen years ago , geeky ted ( ben stiller ) lucked out in having dazzling mary ( cameron diaz ) go with him to the senior prom  
as luck would have it , on that very day , he was hospitalized  
why , i shall not tell , but i assure you , it isn+t pretty  
he hires a private investigator to find her : pat healy ( matt dillon )  
he becomes one of the great comic villains  
upon finding her , he too is lovestruck , and so pursues her , lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped  
it is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double-crossed , and goes to get her for himself  
would the geek get the girl ? 
puh-lease  
the ending is pure hollywood ; no surprises there  
but the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers , hair gel , the mentally disabled , the physically handicapped , interracial marriages , homosexuals , skin conditions , serial killers , tanning , and drugged-up dogs  
the dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission , and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame  
and yet , for all the targets that are hit , the film maintains its sweet tone  
mary , playing the straight role , is as sweet and caring as she is beautiful  
she is totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother , warren ( w  
earl brown--miles away from the cameraman in _scream_ )  
mary+s sunniness carries the film here--it compliments the below-belt gags that come at you  
cameron diaz makes her totally charming , and the audience respects her , even though women in general do not usually undress before an open window  
ben stiller also fares very well , totally changing his image from his _reality bites_ and _flirting with disaster_ straight men to being a , ( how to say it ? ) , a complete loser  
braces , greasy long hair , not too bright , and very very funny  
dillon is exceptionally creepy , especially with his capped teeth  
and rounding out the cast is ted+s friend dom ( chris elliot ) , tanning addict magda ( lin shaye ) , modern troubador/greek chorus ron lichman , and mary+s sweet mom , markie post ( where has she been ? ! )  
not everything works  
chris elliot+s role , skin blemishes and all , becomes merely tasteless and boring  
there+s lousy dialogue about eight-minute vs  seven minute exercise tapes  
and there are long stretches without much going on  
but the wait is worth it  
when those extraordinary sequences hit , the entire theater erupted with howls , tears  
belly-aches , that in some sequences carried over to the following scene  
the farrelly brothers have finally done it  
yes , there are some raunchy bits , but when it is all over , it+s not nearly as bad as it could have been  
while tasteless , it didn+t cross any lines , at least not with me  
while raunchy , it wasn+t nearly as bad as _porky+s_ or _boogie nights_  
and it is sweet enough to be considered a date flick "

1,"what if one of our cities became the target for terror ? 
what can we do ? 
what can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism ? 
what basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice to prevent another oklahoma city disaster ? 
so far america has been the leading nation , opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world  
it is the land of opportunities  
it is the land of freedom  
but what if it became the new target ? 
this dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding in reality  
when a special branch of the united states military , under the command of general william devereaux ( bruce willis ) , takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal , islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice  
the only warning the fbi receives is a single , cryptic message : "" release him  "" 
then all hell breaks loose in new york  
a bus is destroyed , killing 25 civilians  
a broadway theater is bombed  
hostages are taken at a school  
as the wave of terrorist activity crests , the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law  
devereaux argues against that eventuality , but is nevertheless ready to lead 10 , 000 men into action on american soil  
another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities  
his staff is comprised of smart , energetic , intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group o ! 
f moronic feds we're used to seeing in movies  
hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , whose department knows more about the situation than they're willing to reveal  
but the attacks escalate  
the fbi are helpless , chasing an invisible enemy  
the land is under siege  
they have lost control   a 
terror is coming from within   
what's great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror to life  
it reflects reality  
and that's why it makes such an impact  
edward zwick has created a clever , well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season  
the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously  
and so his film plays on several levels , never loosing focus on its main objective  
he is exploring the abuse of power , the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u  s  government ( the army , the fbi , and the cia )  
he takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved  
the palestinian community in 1998 new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii  
there are concentration camps and unlawful interments , all in the name of the "" greater good  "" 
in the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul -- freedom  
was that what the terror ! 
ists really wanted ? 
this film has evoked protests and objections from the arab-american population in the u  s  and n  y  especially  
but to me these protests seem unnecessary  
zwick is careful to not step over the line and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys  
the script is therefore wonderfully balanced "

1,"quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers  
after his pulp fiction , many actors began receiving many offers for jobs  
john travolta made his come-back and is now one of today's most bankable stars  
bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor  
jackie brown , on the other hand , boasts quite a well known cast , except for the main lead : pam grier  
most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films , but she's never really had a breakthrough performance ( her first film was in the roger ebert-written beyond the valley of the dolls )  
that is , until now  
jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino , whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction  
after mediocre acting jobs , tarantino returns to what made his name a household one : directing and writing  
jackie brown is the result , and it is fantastic entertainment  
despite excellent direction from tarantino , the cast steals the film , giving one good performance after another  
pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown , and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent--samuel l  jackson , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , and robert forster  
more than likely , you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations  
describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult , as you really can't say much or you spoil it for everyone else  
i will tread lightly  
jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport  
the camera tracks along with her , and ends up revealing her occupation  
we are also introduced to ordell robbie ( jackson ) , who sells illegal guns to interested buyers    
for a hefty price  
ms  brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away  
however , an fbi agent ( keaton ) and a local l  a  cop ( michael bowen ) are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money  
they try to reach him through beaumont livingston ( chris tucker ) , one of ordell's buyers , but he mysteriously ends up dead  
they try again through brown , but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong-doing  
but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell's friends ( fonda ) , she is caught and sent to jail  
ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent , max cherry ( forster ) , and then wants to find out what she told the cops  
after she claims to have said nothing , she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison  
ordell doesn't like this , but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track  
this scheme seems to be going as planned , but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal  
revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown , and that's the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film  
tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments ( and slang terms ) , but they are always done very well and believably  
his hitmen are normally cruel , but pleasant , in that nasty sort of way  
they talk like normal people , except for when doing business , and they are rude to their girlfriends  
of course , this is a tarantino film , and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise  
and perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop  
of course , tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film , adding a lot of his reservoir dogs-style storytelling to it  
things are told from one person's perspective , and then from another , and then from another , each time learning more and more  
this all leads up to a very interesting conclusion , which decides who is on whose side "
1,"the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and "" real "" movies  
consider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved -- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste  
top-flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety  
based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks , the movie represents a rethinking of the story's structure , not merely a literal adaptation of the novel  
told in linear form by four narrators in the book , egoyan's version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator  
the author is even on record as applauding egoyan's changes  
in the press notes the book's author describes the story as "" a parable of lost children  "" 
he says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children  
picking up on this , egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter , nicole burnell , played with grace by sarah polley , reads parts of "" the pied piper "" from an old , illustrated book to her two charges  
periodically throughout the picture , nicole's readings are heard in voice-over  
you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment  
they and the rest of the town's children come into harm's way -- some live and others are seriously injured  
and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again  
although the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children , the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss  
ian holm , in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career , plays mitchell stephens , an intense man of quiet misery  
mitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small , snow-encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness  
his mission there is a singular one , to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone , anyone , on their behalf  
if this seems crass , well it is , but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot  
the story unfolds slowly and always believably  
each little aspect has its own fascination  
as mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker , played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson , he has a simple task  
he wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit  
wendell ticks off one town member after another and then , as one can in a small town , enumerates each person's numerous faults  
although the town is no peyton place , people there do have their foibles  
one of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good-bye to his kids  
well , single parent billy's fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita  
his confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story  
the accident itself , a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice , isn't shown until the middle of the picture , but , nevertheless , the mystery about it builds throughout the film  
although the picture is no detective story , finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy  
as the injured bus driver , gabrielle rose , dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning  
to round out the story , mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear  
his daughter zoe ( caerthan banks ) is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half-way house and recovery center after another  
fond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help , she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk  
 ( "" i can help you , "" mitchell tries to reassure billy  
 "" not unless you can raise the dead , "" billy snaps back  
mitchell's pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder  ) 
mychael danna's haunting music sets the stage for tragedy  
the cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur , but it is in the warm , shadowy , intimate moments indoors where it works best  
the show , which is ripe for emotional manipulation , never plays with its audience  
still , when the house lights go up , you may feel as i did  
i could barely breathe ; i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed  
more than anything , the film is like a master painting  
each cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint "

1,"the premise of the new teen-targeted horror film `final destination' causes a recollection of a memorable `simpsons' halloween episode  
after attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster , lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable time-machine  
after a trek into the cretaceous period , homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world  
again and again , homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it  
the characters of `final destination' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence - their `design'  
someone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake  
that someone is death  
you see , alex browning ( devon sawa ) and six others have cheated the grim reaper     
but the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve  
for a high school excursion , alex's french class is traveling to paris by airline transport  
alex , tense and neurotic , has a shocking premonition after boarding : he sees the plane , and every passenger on it , spontaneously explode in mid-air  
in a panic of sheer lunacy , alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft  
after a handful of others ( including one teacher ) follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane , the unwitting ? survivors' watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky  
the loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize  
but death won't be cheated so easily , and one by one , the survivors of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances  
the grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi  
before i delve into the meat of the review , i'd just like to confer     
is that one helluva premise , or what ? 
`final destination' , creepy beyond rational comprehension , probably reads more like an unsettling `x-files' episode than `the simpsons' - therefore , the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong  
on familiar turf , the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong , and the opening 20 minutes of `final destination' reflects that  
unlike most thrillers , the set-up is crisp and cool  
you just deeply , sincerely hope that the momentum won't unspool , leaving us with a second-string effort with nothing but cheap , derivative shocks  
young viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration , what with `i know what you did last summer' and sequel , `idle hands' and -- a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil -- `urban legend'  
after the set-up , when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair , i started to really have fun with `final destination'  
low and behold , a teen thriller that is actually unsettling , actually suspenseful and -- yes -- actually intelligent  
some splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside , this film is among the most refreshing and all-out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting-edge `scream' in 1996  
`final destination' stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood-spattered slasher crap we've endured throughout the past few years  
not that the characters are that good  
sawa is game as alex , a connect-the-dots personality that we never fully comprehend  
in addition , the survivors are endearing geek tod ( chad e  donella ) , jocky control-freak carter ( kerr smith of `dawson's creek' ) , carter's ditzy girlfriend terry ( amanda detmer ) , the none-too-subtly named billy hitchcock ( seann william scott , supplier of lukewarm comic relief ) and a lone teacher - the emotionally delicate ms  lewton ( kristin cloke )  
aside from alex , the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter ( `varsity blues' ) , playing an abstract character named clear rivers ( what were her parents thinking ? ! ? )  
the personality of clear is written with such a vague , nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flash-card saying `hello , i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main character's plight ! ' 
toss a few stereotypical fbi agents ( daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith ) and a     ummm "

1,"i hate to burst your bubble , but after all the star power , mega bucks , screenwriters , directors , and cool trailers , men in black is not the best movie of the summer  
it's pretty good in it's own right , yes , but i would probably split the "" best movie "" honors among face/off , spawn , con air , and maybe event horizon  
it's main problem is that it's quickly forgettable , and i can't remember one truly good scene from it  
from con air , it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt  
in spawn , it was the "" living room hell "" conclusion at the end  
in event horizon , it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell's forces  
and all of face/off was pretty dang good  
but as for men in black , the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches  
i remember it not for it's humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted  
and yes , i did see mimic , which is something i'll touch on in a later review  
back to men in black ( is it just me , or does that sound funny ? ) 
i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade and read magazines like wizard , etc  ( for those of you who aren't comic-geeks , wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars , what the new yorker is to high society , what boy's life is to boy scots  
okay , that one was pretty pathetic  ) 
few people know this , but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was , while not honest-politician-rare , very hard to find  
this was after the release of the high-grossing batman forever , and it said that tommy lee jones and chris o'donnell were being considered for the roles ( in the comic book , there were no black men in black  
kind of weird , huh ? ) 
all i can say is , thank god they didn't cast chris o'donnell  
i know i can't be the only person on the planet who thinks he's an annoying , preppie little snot    
sorry  
my apologies to o'donnell fans  
i actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him , anticipating rather craftily that , if the movie was a big hit , it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely  
he decided not to sell them to me , because they were "" innappropriate ""  
hmm     
so now you're probably wondering why i've wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years  
good question  
i'll move on to the movie now  
as you probably already know , will smith and tommy lee jones ( agents k and j , respectively ) belong to a top secret agency known as divison 5 , or it's nickname mib ( men in black  ) 
men in black is a reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear , and they're mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while they're here on earth  
not to get too technical or spoil the plot for the 6 people in the world who haven't seen this movie , but a basically-big-roach-type-bug lands in a redneck farmer's yard , inhabits his body , and attempts to destroy the entire universe  
not bad , eh ? ( i have no idea why i just typed that  
i'm not even really paying attention anymore  ) 
the special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black  
i found their main headquarters to be boring , as were the "" cool weapons "" they had  
the noisy cricket just plain sucked , no matter what anyone said  
and the movie definitely surprised me in tone , although it probably shoudln't have  
it's director , barry sonnenfield , is known for "" black humor "" , directing both addams family movies  
this movie was basically a "" black comedy "" , not an action/sci-fi like i expected from the trailers  
don't get me wrong on what i think of this movie  
it's not bad , i gave it * * * "

1,"it was easy to fear the worst  
begin with a classic 1960's television series , add a big budget and an a-list star in the lead role , and stir  
script , you ask ? 
who needs one , kid    
we've got ourselves a formula  
that was my fear : a bloated monster without any sense of direction  
then , much to my amazement , everything that could possibly go wrong    
didn't  
the fugitive is as lean , taut and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last several years  
under the direction of andrew davis ( 1992's under siege ) , the fugitive grips you by the throat from the outset and never lets go  
expect box office to go through the roof , deservedly , and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones  
the premise is a simple one  
dr  richard kimble ( harrison ford ) is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer , a man with an artificial arm  
after an escape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry , kimble finds himself on the run  
his one goal : to find the one-armed man ( andreas katsulas ) before u  s  marshall sam gerard ( tommy lee jones ) finds him  
where the fugitive surprises the most is the script , by jeb stuart and david twohy  
in a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic , the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence , its attention to detail and its respect for the audience  
in an early sequence , kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard , slick back his hair and change into a lab coat  
on his way out , a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesn't know is kimble to zip up his pants  
it's a small moment , but it punches home the urgency of kimble's situation , and exactly what a man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget  
later , while trying to lose himself in a parade , kimble thinks to drop his overcoat , the most likely way he'd be recognized from behind  
it's these details which convince us that when a colleague of kimble's tells gerard that he's too smart to be caught , he may just be right  
credit must also be given to the special effects and stunt coordinators  
the bus crash which allows kimble's escape is a spectacular sequence , as is a leap from a dam into the water below  
the action is crisp and brutal , and never romanticized  
special kudos go to director davis for maintaining a relentless pace which underscores the single-mindedness of the two leads  
and what a pair of performances those leads are  
tommy lee jones is nothing short of brilliant as gerard , because he manages an incredibly challenging feat  
for the first third of the film , there is really no * villain * per se ; kimble is on the run , and gerard is out to find him  
it would have been very easy to turn gerard into a malevolent , vindictive inspector javert , but that never happens  
instead jones plays him as a sharp , committed man who's just doing his job , so that when he responds to kimble's comment , "" i didn't kill my wife , "" with a matter-of-fact , "" i don't care , "" we know exactly what he means  
it's not his job to determine guilt or innocence  
it's his job to bring in a fugitive  
this is a well- written character played with relish by an actor at the top of his form  
the only unfortunate thing about jones' stunning turn is that it's likely to overshadow harrison ford , and that's a shame  
for his entire career , ford has been underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an action hero  
however , he does a fine job with the less flashy part of kimble , always keeping at the forefront the advantage this man has because of his intelligence "

1,"it's been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller , where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters , but it's been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually * shock * cared for the characters , not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles , flaws , and strengths to emerge so radiantly  
i'd saw that it's been at least a couple decades , even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers , though i'm hardly comparing "" a simple plan "" to , say , "" rear window "" or "" strangers on a train  "" 
yet it's almost as good  
it's simple , yet strangely complex , and astonishingly rewarding , because instead of moving from plot point to plot point , and merely laying out they-might-be-caught overtones , it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to , all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral  
elegantly directed by sam raimi ( yes , the same ) , "" a simple plan "" concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright , moderately financially stable working man ( bill paxton ) , his dim-witted brother ( billy bob thornton ) , and his drinking buddy ( brent briscoe )  
without anyone around , and the possibility that no one would come looking for it , the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes , they will keep it , but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking , and so they generally don't flaunt anything they don't want to flaunt , they'll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton  
the possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners , who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves  
 "" a simple plan , "" though borrows a little from each of these  
a little tiff with the cops here , a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there ) , and a bit of inside feuding over here  
but , as austin powers would say , that's not necessarily its bag ( baby )  
what i most admired about this film , and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it's successfully able to have its cake and eat it too  
it effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches , like the ones mentioned above , but at the same time , it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag  
so while steps are taken to neatly cover things up , and these subsequent steps go miserably awry , the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to , they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity  
in one early scene , paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn't look like it was all stolen ( not a bad idea ) , when thornton screws up ( as he does continuously throughout the movie ) , and paxton has to do some major covering-up ( read : homicide )  
instead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands-washing , raimi shows a lengthy , painful shot from a low-angle onto paxton's face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion  
there's a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he's committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective , but the previous shot is even better : more morally complex and more gut-wrenching  
in short , probably the best piece of direction raimi's ever done , demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results ( for further proof , watch "" persona "" 's "" sex scene "" and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman's ever done )  
but the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof  
yet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story  
when the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife , played by bridget fonda , a pal to raimi ) , he does , and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights  
there's at least two grand shootouts , and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history , and when they arrive , they don't come with masochistic delight but with cringe-inducing horror  
during the one , i was actually sinking into my chair , with the mantra "" they can't do this , can they ? "" 
streeming through my head  
in fact , this film , which is getting many comparisons to the coen's [superior , but forget about it] "" fargo , "" has many similar moments of manic insanity , attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what , in other hands , would be over-the-top distractedness ( imagine , i suppose , robert rodriguez directing this    then 
again , after seeing the "" evil dead "" films , i'd hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off , although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed "" raimi "" moments , a rifle-shot notwithstanding )  
instead , raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch , easily letting the story and characters co-exist , while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out , like some offbeat comic touches  
most particularly , billy bob thornton's character , jacob , is a brilliant creation  
his dim-wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film , every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter ) , but there's authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we're not totally laughing at him  
the chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full-condescension because thornton is so damn real  
jacob's a multi-dimensional character , and while being stupid , we see that as not so much a flaw , but a strength to his character : his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system , primarily towards the middle where his bud and co-conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money  
the final third of the film spends much time with him , and many of the touches upon his character , not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b  smith ( adapting his own book , by the way ) are just great  
i particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend , told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near-sweetness and further strength of his saddened character  
thornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance , by far the best performance he's ever given and further proof that he's the best character actor in contemporary cinema ( if you don't believe me , go back and watch his wonderful performance in "" primary colors , "" a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn't been in the same year ) because he's easily able to slip into a character , and make him completely and utterly believable  
he brings so much weight to the film that , as it is with most character actors , it's difficult picturing anyone else in the role  
the rest of the cast is great too , from paxton's declining working man to chelcie ross' amiable town sheriff  
even fonda shows off her talents nicely  
and if i had any complaints about the film , it's that the plot is almost too simplistic , and that at times , it seems too much like an exercise , like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved  
and the occasional narration is , as it usually is , annoying ( narration should be used with extreme caution , especially when you're trying to set things up and/or express emotions - didn't raimi watch the first murder scene ? )  
and , the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie , the ending is basically amiss  
i won't reveal it , but it's way too cruel and too much of an outsider set-up , as if the appearance of a plane wasn't already too much of that anyway  
for a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved , this is the wrong ending "
1,"it's an interesting premise  
our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real  
in truth , our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains  
what we see , what we do , everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence  
our bodies , severely atrophied , are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet  
the sci-fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along  
the matrix isn't it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network , a sham world , the ability to plug one's brain into a computer , has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator , dark city , and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation )  
what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking  
keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo , who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer-generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines  
the group's leader , morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) , has chosen neo because he believes neo is "" the one "" who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence  
>from the beginning of the film , we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out  
this , in a lesser movie would be annoying , but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun  
what is reality ? 
what is a sham ? 
the film turns our very perception of life on its side  
more than once , we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality , or live a life of relative bliss , oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings  
as viewers , this is intriguing enough , so imagine what it would be like for neo  
and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ? 
reeves , whom i've never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety  
he was good in speed , for example , but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds  
neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely , so much of my expectation was happily for naught  
in a couple of places , the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature , and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski  
i mean , since bill and ted's excellent adventure , what movie could you say really "" utilized "" keanu reeves ? 
more interesting than reeves is fishburne , who's morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions , and convincingly so  
very surprising for a sci-fi movie  
fishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout , as if he always knows what to expect  
this helps to further the aura of his character's proficiency and extensive knowledge  
hugo weaving as agent smith , one of the artificial intelligence's anti-intruder programs , is also good playing his deadpan , no-nonsense , kick ass role , which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time  
unfortunately , when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row , the nature of his character's speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive  
carrie-anne moss plays trinity , morpheus's number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo  
although her character is somewhat inconsistent , moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn't in the picture  
there were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects  
many methods of imagery are employed , from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics  
of special note is the use of the "" freeze and turn "" effect where the entire scene is frozen , turned , then continued from a new angle  
this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi-circle , with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends  
the motion cameras film the action , and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once  
place each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second  
pretty slick  
the matrix drips with style  
from the clothing to the music to the action , we're watching an exaggerated version of what we're used to  
much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there's a lot of kung fu , there's a lot of gunplay  
when a character is letting go with an automatic weapon , much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion  
there's also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados ) , especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects  
combined , it's really like no live-action film i have ever seen  
the film is not without its faults  
some of the scenes and ideas are "" borrowed "" a little too liberally from other films , and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing  
some of the lines are also pretty bad - in one instance , a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying , and it wasn't meant to be a joke "

be forewarned  
 "" all the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts "" - excerpt from as you like it , act ii , scene 7 
when william shakespeare penned this passage , he could not have possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent , or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash  
this is the world of today , and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical high-concept project like the truman show  
truman burbank ( jim carrey ) seems to have the perfect life  
he has a pretty , doting wife meryl ( laura linney ) , a comfortable insurance sales position , an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven , a reliable childhood buddy marlon ( noah emmerich ) -- except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia , this is paradise  
or so it would seem  
bizarre , inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in truman's life  
a lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky  
a rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term 'isolated' follows him around  
a radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move  
for the first time in his life , it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be  
the truman show , directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol , is a remarkably well-constructed film , paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next  
balancing drama with humour , thoughtfulness with abandon , this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy  
in many ways , mr  niccol's screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca -- both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity , with pivotal , character-defining moments occurring at sea  
although the film's rather conventional climax doesn't sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two-thirds , and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch , there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception  
despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film , it remains foremost a finely-crafted piece of entertainment , constantly light and accessible  
the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude , and as the carefully-stacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down , the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false  
the end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable , crowdpleasing underdog vs  
the system formula  
while the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept , some elements are lacking  
the device of mysterious lauren/sylvia ( natascha mcelhone ) as a contributing impetus to truman's growing awareness isn't exactly convincing  
there's not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves , and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ( ed harris ) with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience , thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film  
in fact , although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside truman's artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers , it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even * more * deeply in the insulatory seahaven world , with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling  
still , the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target , and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti-voyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city  
i've always believed that the versatile ms  linney possesses a tremendous comic gift -- she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes -- and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character , mischievously flashing a glazed , insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans  
cheerfully going over the top , it's hilarious to watch her -- who would have ever guessed that she'd have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film ? 
ms  linney is a delight in the film  
but it is mr  carrey who rules the show here  
he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank -- the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts -- but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal : it's difficult not to root for truman  
in a commanding performance , mr  carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence , and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn , demonstrating admirable restraint -- there's an early scene where he's down on his knees gardening , and given his past track record , one almost instinctively anticipates mr  carrey to pull one of more infamous , and in this case , wholly inappropriate sight gags  
it's almost poetic how this notorious look-at-me actor successfully tones it down to play a character who's constantly the centre of attention  
in addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast -- mr  emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness -- the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman's antiseptic , white picket-fenced smalltown utopia , and by burkhard dallwitz's original score  
technical credits are first-rate all around  
while the truman show is clearly a definitive high-concept film , it's not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one -- obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound , ranging from 1965's secret agent through to the groundbreaking british 1967 tv series the prisoner  
all the same , this is a visionary , award-calibre film : entertaining , provocative , and intelligent  
the curious ( and possibly disturbing ) thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the film's concept seems unfathomably outrageous , it's abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching , if not actualisation , at least permissiveness of such a scenario "
1,"star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) 
review by matt pusateri 
few movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas' 1977 classic , star wars  
the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture  
arguably , more americans today can explain what "" the force "" or a "" jedi "" is than a budget deficit or a serb  
so 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? 
can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? 
against this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week  
and despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment  
while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking  
it is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films  
the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films  
as the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson )  
the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation  
the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo's young queen amidala ( natalie portman )  
later , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice  
on tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts  
qui-gon senses the child is "" unusually strong "" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be "" the one "" prophesized to "" bring balance to the force  "" 
as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader  
complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala  
while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul  
if the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is  
the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin's turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy  
but the complexity is not overwhelming  
the story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode  
one of the reasons the film's story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused  
it's unclear whose story phantom menace is  
in the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke's story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight  
but it's unclear whether this new film is anakin's story or obi-wan's  
if this trilogy is centered on anakin , it's a shaky foundation  
lloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive  
on screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is "" the one  "" 
the rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas  
neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight  
mcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility  
portman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality  
the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them  
individually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series  
but unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn't do as good of a job playing the characters off one another  
in star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke  
the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities  
in the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other  
there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other  
individually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them  
this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers  
but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging  
many of the wonderful elements of lucas' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining "

1,"true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head-on , which is probably why so few of them do it  
even the most religious directors - like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman - usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms  
so it's not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get "" the apostle "" onto the big-screen  
as a matter of fact , even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing , and he ended up paying for it with $5 million of his own money  
he also wrote the script , directed the film , and starred as the central character , a fiery texas preacher named euliss "" sonny "" dewey  
few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial , technical , and creative responsibility single-handedly , and it's testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall  
and , thankfully , every bit of that personal investment translates on-screen into power and honest emotion  
sonny is an energetic , pentecostal preacher who has been speaking ( actually shouting ) from behind the pulpit since he was twelve  
he spends much of his time traveling about the country , evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals  
unlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers , sonny is not a phony or a swindler , and the film's purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church  
duvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says , although like all humans , he has weaknesses  
one of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that , not only does his long-suffering wife , jessie ( farrah fawcett ) , want to leave him for another man in the congregation , but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher  
faced with the loss of two things he loves passionately- his church and his family - that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper  
at his son's baseball game , sonny snaps and smashes his wife's lover in the face with a baseball bat , inflicting a wound that may be fatal  
not knowing what else to do , sonny disappears  
he throws away his identification , drives his car into a lake , and takes a bus to louisiana , hoping to start over again  
in the tiny , mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte , sonny once again finds his calling  
after befriending a simple auto mechanic ( walt goggins ) and tracking down the town's ex-minister ( john beasley ) , sonny sets up his own church , the one way to heaven temple  
re-christening himself as "" the apostle e  f  , "" he quickly draws together an eager congregation , and together they realize real change in each other's lives  
but , always , sonny's past is lurking a step behind him , waiting to swallow his progress  
duvall has made his intentions in making "" the apostle "" clear  
in a recent article in "" newsweek , "" he wrote : "" filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit , and when they do , it tends to be patronizing - full of charlatans and snake handlers    
but what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe , and to portray it in an accurate way  "" 
the strength of duvall's convictions turn out to be the strength of his film - "" the apostle "" always rings true , even in the most painful moments , because we know he's being sincere with the subject matter  
after fifteen years of traveling the country , listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said , duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual  
his sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to  
 "" i've always called you jesus and you've always called me sonny , "" he says  
when neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs , sonny's mother ( june carter cash ) just hangs up on them because she knows there's no sense trying to interrupt him  
the main theme to emerge from "" the apostle "" is the fact that good can come from any situation  
sonny's act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing , and duvall never shrinks from that fact  
however , that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte , where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him  
in his short time in louisiana , he does a world of good , and when the police finally show up to take him away , he goes quietly , knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him  
and , as a scene during the final credits shows , he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment  
it is that strength in sonny's character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others - he is flawed , but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws  
weak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves  
watching duvall on-screen , it's not hard to imagine that he would have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting  
as sonny , he completely inhabits the character , and his performance is certainly the best of the year  
because he spent so much time absorbing the traits , methods , quirks , and personalities of real preachers , duvall was able to create a complete character who always feels indelibly human  
as a director , duvall feels that less is more "

1,"natural born killers is really a very simple story that , in essence , has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis , mood and degree  
both films glamorize "" outlaws , "" in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers  
both relate the story of a couple liberated by love  
but where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle , natural born killers is total and blatant  
where bonnie & clyde was social , natural born killers is psychological  
what bonnie & clyde hinted at , natural born killers confronts and explores  
what bonnie and clyde stole , mickey and mallory kill  
to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them , expressed metaphorically as killing , subdues the mysterious power this film wields  
for the most part , when mickey and mallory kill , they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily , they kill what is trying to kill them , they kill what dissembles and cowers from life , they kill what needs to be killed  
this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity  
brahma created  
vishnu preserved  
and siva destroyed , but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma  
the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate , i'm forced to say it for clarity's sake : a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes , that is , destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics  
your plumber , bonnie and clyde , mickey and mallory , and siva are all productive destroyers  
i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death , presently and historically , than any other phenomena  
muslims kill christians  
hindus kill muslims  
christians kill pagans  
jews kill christians , etc  you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged  
religion is an orgy of killing  
the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn't been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable  
 "" the state is the divine idea upon earth , "" hegel said , meaning it is absolute , all-powerful , ineffable , unassailable , infallible , authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh , allah , god , etc  
well , what does all this have to do with natural born killers ? 
let me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex  
consider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever  
god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc  they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other  
during the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power  
 ( parenthetically , witness plato as well  
in the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime  
not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions  ) 
catholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil  
it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure  
masturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution  
this is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence  
as further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters  
our culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years  
we can't help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self  
mickey and mallory knox internalized them , too , then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other , discovered them , and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves  
it is a straightforward liberation through sex  
as some good patriarch once observed , "" you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on  "" 
m&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions "

1,"it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship , a green ovular pin , and the birth of oscar wilde , but if one really strains , they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off  
wilde's philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature , and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned , loosing his family and his career  
the glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise  
the main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life ( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality ) , they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else  
and that's why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began  
it's been said that todd haynes' "" velvet goldmine , "" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement , not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it , steals a lot from "" citizen kane , "" and that's true  
in the film , a british journalist in the 80s , arthur stuart ( christian bale ) , is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade , a fictitious rock star , who faked his own death on stage , bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement  
structure-wise , this totally steals from "" kane , "" not only from the set-up ( he interviews three people , and the story is a result of their flashbacks ) , but in other things , like the beginning ( death , then newsreel ) , and smaller details , like the bitter ex-friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex-wife as a washed-up lounge singer , found in a bar after hours  
this is no "" kane , "" and it really doesn't aspire to be : it doesn't attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like "" kane "" did , and it doesn't really uncover anything poignant about humanity  
instead , it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants  
the 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy , equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging  
but the 70s scenes are engaging , though , not to mention addictively campy  
they radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era , and a feel that's so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then-footage , they become not only a symbol of decadence , but of times when everything seemed so simple  
instead of creating the world the way it was , haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale : the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you've experienced it , everything else seems so mundane  
there's no outside world to speak of , secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack  
haynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero , curt wild , and their relationship that created , molded , and then brought down the movement , reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that - contributors  
blade - played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers - and wild - played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor - are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop , respectively , complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one-time partners in music , but also partners in bed  
through discussions with slade's ex-manager cecil ( michael feast ) , ex-wife mandy ( toni collette , reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade ) , and finally ex-partner wild , journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era , like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity , including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality ( when he opens up his first slade record , he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket ) , and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene , finally resulting in leading a boring job in america  
haynes demonstrates that he's quite the visual auteur , molding scenes that are like long heald breaths , such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade/wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover , "" baby's on fire , "" with scenes from a decadent drug party ; and the film's most wow-inspiring sequence , the first concert scene of wild with his band , the ratttz , where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy-esuqe movements ( including stripping naked ) and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent , and another ( slade ) discovers his idle  
even the brief music videos , spoofs of bowie's , have a rare visual flair that's pure camp , and which would cause ken russell to drool  
the best sequence , though , may be the beginning , following the prelude , a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the post-movement era  
in it , stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death , where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination , which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet  
with brian eno's famous "" needle in the camel's eye "" playing in the background , the scene has a detached exhileration - the song doesn't seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are  
it has a distance that's hard to put a finger on , and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending , and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show , docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair , depressingly staring into the mirror , it comes off as a none-too-obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film  
this movie's not so much about plot , but more about the way it is presented , making this one of those films which is classified as being "" style over substance , "" a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack  
however , for the most part , the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world , by using his sets , costumes , cinematography , and especially the music to play as characters in his film  
the music is especially notable  
the soundtrack , which is wall to wall , consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno , t-rex , and roxy music , as well as covers by slade's band ( with vocals by thom yorke , and occasionally rhys meyers himself ) , and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie-like  
the cast is rather impressive , but no one really walks away with the film , and no performances are extremely good  
although eddie izzard , as slade's manager ( who challenges slade's first manager to an arm-wrestling match to see who gets control of his career ) and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly , and collette and mcgregor have their moments , rhys meyers and bale are noticably sub-par , neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles  
some of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes  
rhys meyers' brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era , dying when he turned into a retro-garbo , resorting to a life of salinger-ism , and found in the mid-70s to be lying around , sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl  
in fact , no one in this film is really seen as a person , rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era  
bale's character is an especially tough sell : bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood , he's not an extremely personal character , and his cliched experiences ( being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a "" poof "" ) never help us communicate with him  
nevertheless , rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them , and others , bitter , part of which helps the film work , since this is a major piece of eye candy  
at the prime of the movie , they at least look the role of fashionable leaders - slade with his perpetually-changing , androgonys persona , and wild with his topless and unpredictable image , which clash and fuse into an unstable union  
their story - of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who-cares attitude crossed with camp - is engaging , without the personal background  
the story of stuart , though , is a tougher sell because he's the everyman , and when you can't totally identify with the everyman , your story's in slight trouble  
as a cultural rock piece , "" velvet goldmine "" is rather good , but it is merely good  
it never totally takes off , although it has moments where it absolutely flies , but then comes back down  
it's really nothing more than a bunch of really great moments , surrounded by material that could really be much better  
the beginning is captivating but slow , the middle is fantastic , and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that , it drags ( the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion , it could probably stop at any point )  
and did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths ? 
it almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past , which is commendable but not totally so "

killing zoe =========== 
remake reservoir dogs as a french art film and you're halfway to killing zoe , writer/director roger avary's slow-moving story of a failed bastille day bank robbery  
eric stoltz stars as an american in paris who gets in * way * over his head when hooks up with a band of nihilistic bank robbers  
he's the safecracker who's blissful unaware that the bank job is a botch job from the word go  
though intriguing on all fronts , the film is paced at half the speed of pulp fiction , which avary co-wrote with quentin tarantino  
in english and french  
the road to wellville ===================== 
based on the novel by t  coraghessan boyle , the road to wellville doesn't go very far  
bowels , bowels , and more bowels are explored by dr  john harvey kellogg ( a buck-toothed and bespectacled anthony hopkins ) , who , in the early 1900's , advocated abstinence , vegetarianism , and frequent defecation  
he also invented the cornflake

the film is overlong , the characters are cardboard , and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in modern sci-fi history  
that said , there's still plenty to watch here  
sci-fi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands , the morphing headdresses , and a surprisingly spunky james spader  
he plays the egyptologist who gets to prove his theory that that "" somebody else "" built the pyramids  
less interesting are co-stars kurt russell and jaye davidson of crying game fame  
star trek generations ===================== 
trek fans may be more forgiving , but , for the rest of us , the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best  
the story is interesting , but each scene goes too long  
the cast is earnest , but the direction lacks punch  
and so on  
 ( the best example of the latter is a klingon comeuppance that delivers none of the impact of a similar scene in star trek ii  ) 
original enterprise captain james t  kirk appears on both ends of the story , though they cut the scene where shatner turns to the screen to plead "" get a life  "" 
remarkably unremarkable  
miracle on 34th street ====================== 
in a season of the specialist and pulp fiction et al , maybe a remake of miracle on 34th street * is * necessary  
john hughes certainly believes in santa claus and his les mayfield-directed production does nothing to tarnish the memory of the 1947 original  
the romance between costars dylan mcdermott and elizabeth perkins doesn't work too well , but the film makes a strong case that richard attenborough is the definitive kriss kringle  
his chemistry with children can moisten any eye  
no claus for alarm

1,"this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueff's play "" hospitality suite  ''its 
about three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention , whose chicago company has sent them to wichita , where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent a hospitality suite on the 16th floor of the hotel , where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna , someone named dick fuller , who is the head of a big industrial corporation  
he is someone they have never met before , but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account , it is their only reason for coming to the convention  
 "" the big kahuna "" revels in salesmen-talk among the three white christian males , two of them , larry ( spacey ) and phil ( devito ) , who are veteran salesmen , having teamed together for the last twelve years , while bob ( facinelli ) is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department  
these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna , as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite  
the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job , and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life  
the outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why  
what comes into question is their opinions on life and death , on god and morality , and on how they make a living  
these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch  
their dialogue is acerbic , witty , and analytical  
following in the long tradition of salesmen films -- from death of a salesman , the tin men , and glengarry glen ross , as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high  
in this case , it is landing the big kahuna  
they each are trying to see why he's on top and why they are chasing after him  
what makes this film different than the others , is its blatant religious message , comparing orthodox religion to what they do , as both must sell their product  
and how after each one's psyche is stripped clean by the other , there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each  
the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna , but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen  
larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life  
bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ  
his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in  
bob is a baptist , who takes a very non-questioning and literal attitude about religion  
to just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin , according to the way he reads the bible  
when asked by larry why he married his wife , he seems puzzled and can't even say because he loves her , only that marriage is something sacred to him  
the contrast in their personalities is stark  
larry is all business , he simply wants to close the sale  
he comes into the room pumped for the convention , using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman  
he criticizes phil for being so placid , for getting such a small suite , for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp , and for being burned-out  
he tells him to go on a vacation  
get a woman  
while phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change , now that he is 52 and is painfully divorcing his wife , after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long  
he now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in  
he has always been a charmer , shaking everyone's hand , trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale  
larry is more aggressive as a salesman , he is always a heart attack away from every big sale  
in contrast , bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him  
this is his first time for him on the road  
when dick fuller doesn't arrive at the party the salesmen throw , larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering  
when told that he spoke to the secretary , larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account  
but when they start talking to bob , whom they forced to act as the bartender , they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another man's name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus

1,"bruce willis and sixth sense director m  night shyamalan re-team to tell the story of david dunne ( willis ) , a stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child  
on a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job , dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of  
to make things even stranger , dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed  
a comic book art dealer named elijah price ( samuel l  jackson ) , who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly , has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life  
price felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him    
someone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break  
price contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child  
dunne doesn't believe him at first , but price assists him in discovering his "" powers "" and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is  
writer/director m  night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense  
how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years ? 
for shyamalan , the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners  
does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash , though ? 
the answer to that question is not a very easy one , either  
as far as pacing goes , the sixth sense seemed almost interminable  
it wasn't until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re-connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached  
for unbreakable , shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which , in many ways , blows away the film that had come before  
the story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan's direction is excellent , with the camera almost constantly moving  
there are tons of great shots in the film , not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis' character and another train passenger  
the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak  
also very impressive is the film's score by james newton howard ( who also scored shyamalan's sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes , as well as this year's dinosaur )  
several of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film  
one of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to "" exercise "" his powers  
the music , in combination with the stellar visuals , really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie  
if there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year , this one would be it  
the film also boasts some great performances , including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment  
willis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne , who just can't seem to figure out why he's been depressed for the last few years  
his character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him , but he eventually grows into his own under elijah's tutelage  
jackson is one of the better actors of our time , and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah  
though his hairstyle is absurd , jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked  
robin wright penn's role seems slightly underwritten , but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character's need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again  
spencer treat clark , as the dunne's young son jeremy , shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors , and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film  
out of all the characters , jeremy's is perhaps the most emotional , and clark does a great job with the role  
where the film does lose points though , is during its "" surprise "" ending  
shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense , but i found myself saying "" that was it ? ! "" 
when unbreakable revealed its own ending  
it's not that the ending is bad , it's just that the ending doesn't quite have the emotional punch that the other film's did  
plus , it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels ( and i won't reveal the ending here , but you'll understand what i mean when you see it )  
essentially , what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable  
the only real problem is that the ending doesn't quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor  
as long as it isn't held to the standard that sixth sense set ( which it ultimately will be ) , it should be a remarkably well liked film  
one thing seems clear , though "

1,"earth is a harsh , unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent  
people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict , as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee  
the story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves  
the action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but it is really about her nanny , shanta  
shanta has a small circle of male admirers  
two of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim  
the others--sikh , hindu , muslim--are older ; some are married ; but all appreciate shanta , who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das  
 ( she also starred in deepa mehta's previous film , fire , the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water  ) 
in an early scene , the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny ; political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears  
one of the men remarks , jokingly , that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along  
he is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism  
the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses  
it is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter  
the group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together  
but the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state  
a sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees  
another man is murdered  
the group of friends will not meet again  
the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child , and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles  
it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully  
the crux of earth's plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz  
his sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , because they are muslim  
dil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that she marry him  
but she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz's offer  
the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him , and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality : the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate  
despite the things he later does , it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things  
the conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz's transformation--is rather abrupt  
the story earth tells does not end  
it just stops  
it is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction  
but there was no resolution for india and pakistan--they have been at war , on a small or large scale , for decades  
since the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation , it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus  
there is no healing to be had , no closure , on any level ( despite the needless , tacked-on ending , with voice-over narration from lenny as an adult , framing the story )  
earth is , in some ways , an unexceptional movie  
it does not reinvent the wheel , following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas  
but deepa mehta's directon is assured , and the issues she addresses run deep  
earth does for india what movies like zhang yimou's to live and tian zhuangzhuang's the blue kite did for china : they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history  
such films strike me as inherently valuable , even when flawed  
they may be biased or inaccurate , but they bear the weight of human hardship , and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other , more inventive films , often lack  
it is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries : the events shown may have happened decades ago , but they still touch a nerve  
the issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year  
in the near future , india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other  
at the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen ; after seeing earth , i have a much , much better understanding "

1,"synopsis : captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of 600 , the ba'ku , from the evil admiral dougherty and ru'afro  
the enterprise crew , in the meantime , experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba'ku homeworld : lt  worf grows a pimple , data sings opera pieces , picard scores with a ba'ku chick , riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi , and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts  
comments : "" star trek : the next generation "" was a hugely successful sequel tv series to "" star trek , "" a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s  
even though it still enjoyed high ratings , "" star trek : the next generation "" ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original "" star trek "" 's cast in paramount's film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise  
star trek : insurrection is the ninth "" star trek "" movie and the third to focus on the "" star trek : the next generation "" crew  
star trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans , such as myself , would rate somewhere between "" okay "" and "" good  "" 
after star trek v : the final frontier , a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant "" star trek : voyager "" tv series , "" star trek "" fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise  
i don't wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies  
most people reading this probably haven't followed "" star trek "" anyway , so a comparison would seem tedious at best  
let me , thus , make my comparisons briefly so that it's out of my system : star trek : insurrection is not as good as the previous installment , star trek : first contact ; star trek : insurrection's comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv : the voyage home ; star trek ii : the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie  
okay  let's move to the movie itself  
star trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise , humanity's exploration and colonization of space , with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners  
this combination works well more often than it fails , but when it does fail , the humor really seems cheesy  
much of this film appeals to trek fans' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise's crew  
audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times  
star trek : insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba'ku homeworld  
forget the actors and special effects , the beautiful setting of this movie , with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys , steals the show  
this tranquility , however , is broken by data , an android , who reveals to the ba'ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies , the son'a  
it seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth , sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young , healthy state  
the enterprise crew , led by captain picard , investigates data's actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the son'a and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba'ku and plunder the planet's youth-restoring properties  
sound pretty heavy ? 
it is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film's constant barrage of humor  
when going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous )  
in a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba'ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , cannot avoid looking at  
the acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good  
since they've been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough  
the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean-luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard's trademark , with his usual aplomb  
brent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android-wishing-to-be-human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series )  
the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good  
despite many other critics' negative opinions , f  murray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru'afro well enough  
ru'afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune  
like the baron , ru'afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants  
in one particularly memorable scene , ru'afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds  
ru'afro is no khan from star trek ii--the best trek villain ever--but he is much better than the forgettable dr  soran from star trek : generations  
 ( okay , i promise , no more comparisons  ) 
donna murphy must also be noted as a ba'ku woman , anij , who picard falls in love with  
murphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance  
this is the type of woman whom picard , for those who know the character well , would be enchanted with  
in fact , the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here  
a particular plot point involving anij's ability to slow time down , an ability which she shares with picard , becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie "

1,"when i first heard that disney's next animated feature was going to be tarzan , i was almost horrified  
i was worried that disney was going to make another hercules ( sorry , jerk-ules )  
that effort was too overloaded with comedy ( and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero ) , and , after viewing it to this day , i find it a disgrace for disney animation  
when i saw the trailers , i was thinking "" hmm    
this isn't bad at all  
this just might have potential  "" 
when i bought the soundtrack , i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features  
i have never really heard of phil collins , nor have i heard of mark mancina , so i was wondering , how would these two make this disney flick spin ? 
i was pleasantly surprised : the music is top-notch  
phil collins' songs are terrific , percussion-heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs  
the score from mark mancina was also neat ; it reminded me a bit of the lion king , but it was more original  
so , the soundtrack wasn't bad at all , considering it was by two people i am not familiar with  
this film could be good    
but will it be ? 
when i finally went to see it ( on opening day , as i tend to do with most disney animated features ) , my question was answered , in a complete turnabout of expectations for me : disney's tarzan is surprisingly decent  
the story starts out with tarzan's parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace  
however , one day , a vicious leopard , sabor , attacks and kills tarzan's parents , leaving him ( at this time , a baby ) alone-until kala of the apes rescues him  
kala wants to raise the child as her own ( she lost hers previously to sabor ) , but her mate , kerchak is not too sure  
 "" it's not our kind , "" he says  
he agrees , though , to let her take care of little tarzan , but "" that doesn't make him my son  "" 
tarzan grows up , vowing to be "" the best ape ever "" , but no matter how hard he tries or what he does ( at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend , terk ) , he just can't convince kerchak that he is one of the apes , even when he defeats sabor in a battle  
one day , a new animal shows up : humans  
this is where jane comes into the picture  
she is on an expedition with her father ( professor porter ) , and a despicable hunter ( clayton ) searching for gorillas  
tarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons , and soon they get to know each other  
even though tarzan falls in love with jane , this causes things to go wrong  
clayton tricks tarzan into taking him , jane , and porter to see the apes , who are convinced that he has betrayed them  
worse , clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money  
will tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes ? 
i'm not gonna tell you , sorry  
you're gonna have to see for yourself  
and see it you should ; the animation is , as always , top notch , particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees ( read that , skateboarding )  
the deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in  
in fact , it seems similar to the computer imagery/cel animation combination in rival disney animted films , such as fox's anastasia and dreamworks' prince of egypt  
could it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals ? 
the casting is fairly good  
tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan ( and to my relief , the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules  
nicely done ) , and glenn close is wonderful as kala ( she has a beautiful singing voice , too , by the way )  
lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson's beast voice , which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping  
minnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane  
i thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film ( when i first saw the trailers ) , but when i saw the film , i didn't have a problem with her  
i take back my insult on driver  
it's nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature ( he was fflewdurr flamm in disney's most underrated classic , the black cauldron ) ; he is funny and delightful as professor porter "
1,"on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements ( in case you missed it , warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail  
he says to a black congregation ""    if you can't cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife , you're never gonna get rid of me  "" ) 
well , there is such a plot , and it works very well in this comedy  
beatty plays jay billington bulworth , a long-time democratic senator from california  
the movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth's latest commercials condemning affirmative action  
the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy  
when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv , having gone without food or sleep for days  
his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care  
first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe - a $10 million life insurance policy in his daughter's name  
then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination  
his assistant murphy ( oliver platt ) is oblivious to bulworth's suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements  
bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african-american church , then takes questions from the audience  
he is hit hard with questions about his voting record  
he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots , and it hasn't shown up  
since he's a dead man anyway , he figures he'll answer truthfully : he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l  a  for the photo opportunity  
they made some promises that improved their public image for a while , and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made  
the shock and outrage from the congregation grows , the questions keep coming , and he keeps shooting back honest , if ugly , answers  
 ( before i go further , i'd like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make , and that is that characterizing african-americans as malt-liquor drinking o  j  
fans is not part of bulworth's "" truth  "" 
that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie  
when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics , this line is not what they're talking about  ) 
the experience is liberating  
with nothing left to lose , bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth  
he can say whatever he wants because he's going to be dead anyway  
why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician - that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists , and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism ? 
bulworth's candor wins him three volunteers from the church , one of whom , nikki ( halle barry ) , he gets a crush on  
he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something  
chicken wings , appropriately enough  
bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives  
when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings , bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment  
with so much money and so many talented people working so hard , he wonders , why can't hollywood make a quality product  
 ( you go , warren ! ) 
when they become indignant and ask why he's talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product , he callously admits that it's because they are rich jews  
that night he drops the three african-american volunteers at their nightclub , and he decides to go in with them  
he stays up all night drinking , smoking pot , dancing , falling in love with nikki , and learning to scratch turntables and rap  
the next day , he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit-and-tie fundraisers  
from then on , at all of his political appearances , he raps his political truth  
his rap is not bad for a middle-aged white guy  
he's not very good , but it is his first try and at least he's not embarrassingly bad "

91 minutes  
rated r , stars ) 
had "" hedwig and the angry inch "" came out in the '70s , right after david bowie's "" ziggy stardust , "" it likely would now be regarded as one of the most popular rock musicals of all time  
released in the 500 channel , sensory overload world of 2001 , however , the big screen adaptation of the acclaimed off-broadway musical must do battle with countless other productions clamoring for attention  
i almost missed it  
every august , the major studios try to squeeze the last few dollars out of summer moviegoers by dumping all of their shakier offerings on the marketplace at once  
i was so busy trying to keep up with national releases like "" summer catch "" and "" bubble boy "" that i passed over any independent film that looked like it would only have a short local run  
but an e-mail from a reader asking why i hadn't reviewed the movie prompted me to make a late evening trip to the theater  
thank goodness for readers like him  
 "" hedwig and the angry inch "" is a gender-bending glam-rock spectacular packed with great songs  
stylistically , the hook-laden tunes are reminiscent of bowie , "" bat out of hell "" era meatloaf and "" the rocky horror show , "" without ever seeming like imitations  
as with "" tommy , "" "" hedwig "" tells a story of isolation , pain and defiance , but without the bloated feel of that beloved , but overrated rock opera  
writer-director-star john cameron mitchell and composer-lyricist stephen trask have cooked up a real winner  
mitchell stars as hedwig , a singer from east berlin touring a chain of u  s  coffee shops with her pan-slavic band , the angry inch  
while the patrons of the run-down restaurants look on in shock , and sometimes horror , hedwig boldly tells the sad story of her life in song  
she was once a boy named hansel ( ben mayer-goodman ) , living with his mother ( alberta watson ) and listening to rock and roll on american armed forces radio  
life is an exercise in duality for hansel  
a wall splits his hometown into two parts  
mother describes love as the emotion that comes when you find your other half  
as hansel grows up , the duality becomes more pronounced  
after initially mistaking him for a girl , a gi from the states ( maurice dean wint ) falls in love with hansel and wants to marry him  
alas , hansel will never pass the mandatory physical  
mother helpfully suggests a sex change , but the operation goes bad , hence the references to "" the angry inch "" ( yes , i know this part is squirm-inducing , but stick with me - it's worth it )  
several years later , mr  right is long gone and hansel becomes hedwig , decked out in a farrah fawcett-style wig and fronting a band made up of korean women  
hedwig finds a new love in tommy ( michael pitt ) , a beatific lad with a unique take on christianity  
but tommy does hedwig wrong , stealing her songs and becoming a superstar  
cut to the present  
tommy gnosis' stadium tour is thriving and hedwig is suing him  
despite warnings from her manager ( andrea martin ) that she could easily be labeled a stalker , hegwig and her new band , the angry inch , continue their coffee shop tour , shadowing the thief by playing whatever city he is in  
if this sounds like a bizarre premise for a rock musical , take a few seconds and consider the plotlines of "" tommy "" and "" rocky horror  "" 
as hedwig , john cameron mitchell does a magnificent job taking a character that could have simply been a caricature or an icon and turning her into a compelling human being  
mitchell has world-class style and vocal chords to match  
even though the backstory is unusually strong , mitchell never forgets that the production is first and foremost a rock musical  
everything is propelled by one terrific song after another and , trust me , these are full-fledged rock songs , not the over-processed fluff that passes for rock in most musicals  
while mitchell remains in the center of the stage throughout the film , there is much of interest on the sidelines  
miriam shor does fine work as yitzhak , hedwig's lover and bandmate , conveying a great deal through expressions alone "

1,"imagine this  
you're given a sword and a shield and very basic , minimal training  
a man you don't know tells you that this will be the last day that you will live  
you are thrown into an arena with thousands of spectators wanting to see you die  
you frantically monitor several closed doors which , in seconds , will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you  
you watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few days are murdered in cold blood  
if you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you , you know you're going to have to do it all over again tomorrow  
eventually know matter how strong or skilled you are , you're going to die  
this is the life of a gladiator  
you'll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing ridley scott's powerful gladiator , you'll be thankful for that  
with his new film , scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire  
and like those preceding it , spartacus and ben hur , gladiator has nearly everything going for it - a strong lead actor , a wonderful supporting cast , eye-catching special effects , and a great script  
since the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator ( teenagers to thirty-year-old males ) were around , a whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited  
>from a weak beginning , the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious  
rome's best general maximus ( russell crowe ) , who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted , is currently ( in the year 180 a  d  that is ) waging a war against germania  
scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style , similar to that of saving private ryan but much less effective  
it's blurry , in slow motion , and the sound is muted  
as soon as this artistic method began , it was hard to tell what was what and who was who  
it's a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch  
instead , the general swears he will get out after this battle  
he wants to go back to his family and his crops , he wants a quiet life  
but , unexpectedly , he gets anything but that  
the dying emperor of rome , marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies  
he asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more power to the senators  
all of this does not go well for aurelius' son , commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor  
jealous and upset , commodus kills his own father , names himself emperor , kills maximus' wife and son , and attempts to kill maximus  
but maximus is able to escape his own death and vows to kill commodus and fulfill marcus aurelius' wishes  
now a slave , the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator , who eventually are released for their success  
a story of betrayal and promises , gladiator is more than just a mindless action flick  
you actually care about the characters , sometimes even the evil villain commodus , who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way  
phoenix plays his character brilliantly  
think of commodus as the percy wetmore ( of pant-wetter the green mile ) of the roman empire - a whiny , sleazy , "" respect-me-because-my-father-was-a-good-man "" brat who hates when he's not the center of attention  
every scene we see commodus , he's either crying or he looks like he has just been crying  
phoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die for , and gladiator shows he's more than just river's little brother  
crowe is also excellent as the film's grisly-faced hero  
maximus is one of the few characters in recent cinema who actually has emotions  
this guy actually acts like a anyone in his situation would act , he's no invincible superhero who only blurts out one-liners , he ( believe it or not ) acts like a human being ! 
the rest of the cast , including richard harris , djimon hounsou , walter hill , derek jacobi , and connie nielsen are also first rate  
ridley scott , using outstanding special effects , has brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum , the loudness of the roman mob , and the city of rome in general  
the visuals are breathtaking and voluminous , like a cleopatra of the year 2000  
the costuming is also wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the exquisite dress of the upper-class politicians  
gladiator is another movie you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experience "

1,"confession time : i have never , ever seen gone with the wind  
i don't know why , really  
haven't wanted to check it out on video , haven't been at home the nights it was on network tv , and it was too far to drive the last time it was on the big-screen  
so right up front , i'll admit that i don't know what the heck i'm talking about , but here goes    
is titanic the gone with the wind of the 1990's ? 
maybe that's going a little bit too far  
as good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie , they're no clark gable and vivien leigh  
but    
the parallels are there  
gwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available -- technicolor  
titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors  
gwtw places america's greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story , titanic does the same with the atlantic's most legendary tragedy  
they both have strong-willed redheaded heroines , they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slaves/steerage bums , they were both incredibly expensive and popular    
ok , maybe that's not enough parallels  
so titanic's not in gwtw's league  
no matter  
titanic is a great movie in its own right , complete with spills , thrills and ( especially ) chills  
much has been made of the humongous cost of the production , and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again  
the money was obviously well-spent  
the costumes look great , the sets look great , the cgi graphics look great  
i especially liked the expensive little touches , like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks  
but writer/director/producer james cameron's real challenge in writing/directing/ producing titanic wasn't just costuming and set design and special effects  
cameron's major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in  
he succeeds masterfully  
cameron does two things that work incredibly well  
first , he shows us modern-day salvage operations on titanic ( that's just "" titanic "" , not "" the titanic "" , mind you )  
the first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state , corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic , from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton )  
television coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues 101-year-old rose calvert ( gloria stuart ) , who survived the wreck in 1912  
stuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role , narrating the story of her experience to a stunned paxton and his roughneck crew  
secondly , cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character , and the romantic triangle between rose ( winslet ) , her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley ( billy zane ) and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon ( dicaprio )  
the way that big-budget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an all-star cast , so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people  
cameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack , while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board  
the supporting cast is professional , but mostly anonymous -- other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown , there's no moment when you stop and say , oh , yeah , i know him , what's he been in  
 ( although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform , or even as the ill-fated engineer  ) 
the love story itself is rather conventional  
i think some reviewers found it weak , and that may be a fair criticism  
the performances are the key here  
zane has the meatiest part in the movie , and he plays the arrogant , condescending steel millionaire to the hilt "

1,"jake kasdan , son of one of the best screenwriters around , breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hard-to-categorize detective story : part mystery , part comedy , part character study and part romance  
for the most part , kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film  
daryl zero ( bill pullman ) is a modern day sherlock holmes  
the parallel is present down to his love of music ( though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin ) , and his addiction to drugs ( amphetamines , rather than morphine )  
he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces , the case about the man who lied about his age , or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes  
however zero's observance of the fine art of detachment , though it makes him a brilliant private investigator , makes him somewhat of a self-imposed outcast in society  
he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr  watson , i mean steve arlo ( ben stiller )  
arlo is not happy with his job  
he is thrilled to be around zero's brilliance , but his bizarre behavior , and strange requests , are frustrating to the former lawyer  
and they're even more so to his girlfriend , jess ( angela featherstone ) , who is fed up that her boyfriend's boss means more to arlo than her  
this is the situation when a new case comes knocking  
gregory stark ( ryan o'neill ) hires zero to find his lost keys  
it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring , and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence  
now , stark is being blackmailed , and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end  
to solve this case , zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell  
however , this is when he is vulnerable    and 
this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic , gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) , who may be involved in the blackmail scheme  
for the first time , zero has to question his own objectivity , as he finds his client less and less sympathetic  
zero effect is weakest in its obviously "" wacky "" scenes depicting daryl zero's odd behavior  
such scenes might be appropriate in an out-and-out satire , making zero an ace ventura-ish character  
however , there's a much meatier movie in here    it just takes a while to get out  
that's not to say that there's not a place for humor in this film  
in fact , some of the best scenes are ben stiller's wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer  
however , the over-the-top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film , and they aren't funny enough to stand on their own  
once the investigation is underway , however , zero's brilliance really begins to shine  
his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlock's own  
as the mystery begins to unfold , zero's deductions lead the plot in interesting directions , but never lose the viewer  
zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well  
zero's relationship with gloria is low-key , but it hits all the right notes  
however , we are always kept distant from gloria's character  
she's given plenty of development , but we never understand what she is thinking  
perhaps that may be intentional : to place the audience in zero's zone of detachment  
but , on the whole , it is frustrating  
bill pullman , when he's not spacing out , creates a vibrant character in daryl zero  
there's one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years , and it is shockingly moving   "

1,"this has been an extraordinary year for australian films  
 "" shine "" has just scooped the pool at the australian film institute awards , picking up best film , best actor , best director etc  to that we can add the gritty "" life "" ( the anguish , courage and friendship of a group of male prisoners in the hiv-positive section of a jail ) and "" love and other catastrophes "" ( a low budget gem about straight and gay love on and near a university campus )  
i can't recall a year in which such a rich and varied celluloid library was unleashed from australia  
 "" shine "" was one bookend  
stand by for the other one : "" dead heart ""  
>from the opening credits the theme of division is established  
the cast credits have clear and distinct lines separating their first and last names  
bryan | brown  
in a desert settlement , hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town , there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals and the handful of white settlers who live nearby  
the local police officer has the task of enforcing "" white man's justice "" to the aboriginals  
these are people with a proud 40 , 000 year heritage behind them  
naturally , this includes their own system of justice ; key to which is "" payback ""  
an eye for an eye  
revenge  
usually extracted by the spearing through of the recipient's thigh  
brown , as the officer , manages quite well to keep the balance  
he admits that he has to 'bend the rules' a bit , including actively encouraging at least one brutal "" payback ""  
 ( be warned that this scene , near the start , is not for the squeamish )  
the local priest - an aboriginal , but in the "" white fellas "" church - has a foot on either side of the line  
he is , figuratively and literally , in both camps  
ernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as the man in the middle  
he is part churchman and part politician  
however the tension , like the heat , flies and dust , is always there  
whilst her husband - the local teacher - is in church , white lady kate ( milliken ) and her aborginal friend tony , ( pedersen ) have gone off into the hills  
he takes her to a sacred site , even today strictly men-only  
she appears to not know this  
tony tells her that this is a special place , an initiation place  
he then makes love to her , surrounded by ancient rock art  
the community finds out about this sacrilegious act and it's payback time  
the fuse is lit and the brittle inter-racial peace is shattered  
everyone is affected in the fall out  
to say more is to give away the details of this finely crafted film  
suffice to say it's a rewarding experience  
bryan brown , acting and co-producing , is the pivotal character  
his officer is real , human and therefore flawed  
brown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards the man , then suddenly feel angry about him  
it wasn't long ago that i visited central australia - ayers rock ( uluru ) and alice springs - for the first time  
the wide-screen cinematography shows the dead heart of australia in a way that captures it's vicious beauty , but never deteriorates into a moving slide show , in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground  
the cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film ; from the western to the birdcage  
at least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people and the line between them and we anglo-saxon 'invaders' : "" jedda "" , "" the chant of jimmie blacksmith "" and "" the last wave ""  
in a year when the race 'debate' has reared up in australia , it is nourishing to see such an intelligent , non-judgemental film as "" dead heart ""  
the aboriginal priest best sums this up "

[theater rating : * * 1/2 : good seats , average sound , picture unstable] 
 "" rounders "" is exactly the kind of movie parents don't want their kids to see  
it's not that it's a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it's a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling  
and to take make things "" worse "" it proves this through its original , fascinating story  
there have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the "" noir "" mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life  
this film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing  
matt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20-something law student in present-day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played  
damon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting  
mike's about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer  
but then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally )  
damon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together  
he never sounds like he's reading from a script , nor that he's trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him  
the screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite  
immediately we get the sense that poker isn't for gamblers , but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel  
the game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers  
the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man  
the film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act  
it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit  
we learn only a little about mike , both past and present  
presently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling  
they go through a few break-up/make-up cycles until mike's childhood pal and fellow rounder "" worm "" ( norton ) is released from prison  
it's not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does  
technically , the plot isn't unlike many children's sitcoms in which the "" good "" kid's "" bad "" friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid  
what this film does is use a different medium to tell that story  
mike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out-thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them  
where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he's dealt and works with them  
sometimes they pay off ( i  e  
his ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they don't ( i  e  
the fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $30 , 000 on a single hand )  
once things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood  
mike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places , from socialites' mansions , to taking the tourists at atlantic city , to outwitting the gangsters that control it all  
everything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything's a battle against the cards destiny deals  
one scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge ( martin landou , in a perfectly cast and performed role ) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time  
matt's good at gambling but he's also got potential to be a great lawyer  
he could go professional as either , but with one he could lose everything or win big , but with the other there's stability but not much risk involved  
can someone who's gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave ? 
if the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker-playing , then the ending is our test  
everything is told from mike's perspective , but we're finally able to recognize some things on our own  
this makes the final , against-all- odds showdown seem like just that  
it works just like the game it revolves around - showing us some of the cards , but still evokes the element of the unknown , and the consequences thereof  
what separates "" rounders "" from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end "

[theater rating : * * 1/2 : okay seats , sound , and picture] 
modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes  
the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it  
 "" your friends and neighbors "" takes a different approach as it's a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends  
one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute's basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story  
firstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras  
everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full-circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative  
but to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult  
labute's ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what's specifically impressive is the fact the characters' names are never revealed until the end credits roll  
for the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic  
another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus  
we're always able to tell where the characters are ( someone's home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc  ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc  is relatively unknown  
the film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater  
no one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background  
we're simply dropped in on the characters' lives and are expected to figure out the rest  
the characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they're only concern right now seems to be their sex lives  
first there's barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don't know what they're problem is  
barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn't have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else  
mary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn't hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something  
labute's script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two  
obviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow  
another couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything  
their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship  
if only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area  
it's natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ? 
what did they ever see in the other person to begin with ? 
labute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it's fascinating  
two other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski )  
cary is an arrogant , hostile sex-maniac who defines the word "" bastard  "" 
somehow he is able to bend women to his will , either through charm or just attitude , into getting his way  
he's the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he's secretly perverted , but somehow barry finds comfort in his company , although jerry is always nervous around him  
patric gives an outstanding performance , so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is  
cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her  
she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another  
she's a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable  
i will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others' action , as that's the hook of the film  
the first two acts begin to set up the characters and each's scenarios , but it's often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom  
the result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual course of actions is always fascinating  
for a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character's guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them  
one of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be  
since the characters only interact with each other there isn't much pop culture references , as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it "
1,"so here is the second of 1999's remakes of classic horror movies  
the first was the dumb , pathetic but ok remake of the classic 'the haunting'  
now comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill  
the classic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people 100 , 000 to stay in his house  
if they survive the night they get the money  
if not well you get the jurisdiction  
having not yet seen the film ( dvd on its way ) i wasn't sure if i would really like the remake  
but sure enough it comes through and has a great storyline to fall back on  
geoffrey rush ( in a fantastic role with an incredible performance ) is steven price , the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people  
his wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends  
steven dismays at the idea and makes his own list  
somehow someone , or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party  
eddie ( taye diggs ) an ex-baseball player , sarah ( ali carter ) an ex-assistant who can re-wire anything , melissa ( brigette wilson ) a talk-show host in sorts , dr  blackburn ( peter ghallager ) , and watson ( chris kattan ) a smart-mouthed humorist in ways  
what he is gonna do is pay these five people 1 , 000 , 000 dollars if they can survive through the night  
if they can they get the money , if not well they don't  
the house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum  
years before mental patients broke out and killed the dr  there , forcing him to lock the place up because if he died , so did they  
everyone who was in there burned to death  
now it is steven price's home and he is throwing this party for these five people  
what starts out as a seemingly normal night , turns into a horrifying , blood splattering night  
the deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed  
one-by-one the people start to disappear  
conspiracies start to turn up , and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all  
the people find rooms , which once held mental patients  
rooms which once had people dying  
rooms which may still contain these people  
now these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house , and they must survive each other with terrorfying results  
since i officially haven't seen the original i can't say which is better  
i can say however i liked this movie  
geoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as the rich steven price , and does a great job doing a vincent price role  
famke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times  
ali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs  
chris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines  
peter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims  
the plot was well conceived and was very absorbing  
the movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy , and even sometimes downright scary  
i found even the opening credits to me a little ominous  
one thing i knew not to expect was a 'haunting' type movie with special effects galore  
even though it had fantastic gore and special effects , the movie has only a 19 million dollar budget , which doesn's show all the way through but you can tell  
the movie was written well , and it's only major flaw is the under-developed characters and plot holes that we are left with  
the ending is quite clever and some may not even get it "

1,"capsule : this is a 1950s or 1960s style heist film , set in the present  
robert deniro stars as a risk-adverse safecracker who wants to retire form crime but takes one last job at the request of a personal friend ( played by marlon brando )  
edward norton plays a hotshot young sharpster who is also in on the crime  
the plot is mostly straightforward suspense with little nonsense  
 , +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
i am sure i must have seen almost the identical plot before  
this is a heist film made for an adult audience who probably wanted a crime film like they had seen in theaters when they were teens  
there are no superhuman acrobats taking nosedives off of buildings like in entrapment  
there is no rock score  
there are no ballet- like martial arts  
this is just a basic heist film with a decent and distinctly credible and un-flashy script  
nick ( played by robert deniro ) is a safecracker who has managed to be successful by never taking risks  
if a job is not a safe bet ( pun intended ) , he backs out  
sometimes even the safe bets turn out not to be so safe  
when one job very nearly goes wrong nick is unnerved enough to decide that it is nature telling him that it is time to get out of the game  
he returns to his home in montreal where he owns a jazz club , and decides to manage it full time  
he proposes to his girl friend diane ( angela bassett )  
she has one condition  
he must stay retired from crime  
but before the deal can be cemented , max , a montreal kingpin and personal friend , has one last supposedly easy job for nick  
nick wants no part particularly because the heist will be right in his hometown of montreal  
more and more details seem to complicate the job  
nick's partner in the crime is to be a smart , but uncontrollable young crook , jack ( edward norton )  
jack treats a locked front door like a welcome mat , even at his associates' homes  
the young crook is a know-it-all who seems good at everything he does but at avoiding rubbing people the wrong way  
together they plan to steal a priceless historic artifact from the montreal customs house  
the script by kario salem , lem dobbs , and scott marshall smith works like an episode of the old "" mission impossible "" television series  
we see pieces of the heist being put together , last minute changes , and things that go wrong , much like a good episode of "" mission impossible  "" 
this team might not be bad choices to write scripts for the tom cruise "" mission impossible "" films  
the complications are , however no more and no fewer than are needed to make the story believable  
the telling is cold and noirish , which is just what it is supposed to be  
director frank oz , the voices of yoda and miss piggy proves surprisingly good at directing a serious crime film  
the score has a more than adequate cast with little flashy or scene-stealing acting  
edward norton probably has the flashiest role and even that is low-key by today's standards  
he plays what is nearly a double role  
jack pretends to be a brain damage victim to be hired for a job in the customs house  
one nice ( ? ) 
character i have not mentioned is stephen ( jamie harrold )  
stephen is a master hacker who lives in his mother's basement in a house with a lot of screaming in both directions  
he seems like the last person the risk adverse nick would want to depend upon  
the film itself remains low-key up until the time of the climactic heist  
then the pace really picks up  
before that the plot even stops twice for jazz interludes  
though oz never lets the music steal time from the story the way woody allen does in sweet and lowdown  
on the subject of music , the score of the score is by howard shore "

1,"glory--starring matthew broderick , denzel washington , and morgan freeman--is the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts , the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war  
broderick plays robert gould shaw , the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle  
shaw , the son of well-to-do abolitionists , hailed from boston high society  
the letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard , and were , evidently , the inspiration for glory  
as the film begins in 1862 , shaw is a captain in the northern forces  
like private eriksson ( michael j  fox ) in casualties of war , shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war--that is , until his company is attacked by enemy forces  
shaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle , witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck  
soon after his recovery , shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort  
glory is the story not only of colonel shaw , but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery  
the film periodically jumps between shaw's point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers  
the movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits , and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action  
the large black cast is uniformly outstanding , especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth  
he is brash and pushy , always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight  
his bitter , tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability  
washington provides much of the film's intensity and emotional power  
in one heartbreaking scene , he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army  
when he removes his shirt to receive the punishment , you cringe at the sight of his back , which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave  
it makes your blood boil  
the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings ; a tear rolls down washington's cheek--and will probably run down your cheek as well  
the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn't deserting the army at all ; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores  
freeman is , as usual , a strong presence , even in a small supporting role  
he plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember  
he quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers , holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers  
colonel shaw recognizes freeman's leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major , making him the first black officer in the army  
andre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles , a free black who is one of shaw's close childhood friends  
searles is educated and refined , like a white man , prompting washington to nickname him "" snow flake  "" 
the burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat  
the road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment  
the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships , but somehow they never lose their morale  
the army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens , subjecting them to racism and discrimination  
they are paid only $10 a month , whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen , and , for a long time , they have to go without shoes , guns , or uniforms  
to make matters worse , the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action , preferring instead to use them for manual labor  
eventually , however , the regiment receives its boots , uniforms , rifles , and right to fight , thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw  
shaw has absolute faith in his soldiers , and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve , even if it means threatening a general with blackmail  
broderick , in fact , is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment  
unfortunately , however , broderick's uneven performance is , in many respects , the weak link in the movie  
in an effort to look more mature , broderick sports a mustache and a goatee , and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent  
he is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced  
the film places too much weight on broderick's character and not enough on the black soldiers , who are more intriguing  
glory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war  
the movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july  
glory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts "
1,"118 minutes ; not rated ( though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language ) 
mamoru oshii is a name that probably isn't very well-known to most american audiences , but perhaps it should be  
oshii was the director of last year's best-known japanese animated film import , _ghost in the shell_ , and is known among fans of japanese animation , or anime , for making films with a deep philosophical bent  
one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series  
in its many incarnations--graphic novels ( "" manga "" ) , two different runs of made-for-video episodes ( original animation videos , or oavs for short ) , and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes--patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan  
set in the very near future ( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived ) , this atypical giant robot anime features the characters , rather than the machinery , as the primary focus  
as a whole , patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan  
as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains , giant industrial robots , known as "" labors "" ( an interesting play on words , considering that "" robot "" is derived from the czech word for labor ) , have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century  
with the rise of labors , however , has come a new menace--labor crime  
this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions , using patrol labors to fight labor crime  
the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division , sv2 , who , through no fault of their own , have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness  
sometimes utterly hilarious , sometimes almost deadly serious , the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers , and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life  
those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie , although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers  
the story , as has much of patlabor before , centers around the controversial babylon project , a gigantic seawall that will , on its completion , allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay  
this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists , most notably the house of sea organization  
however , the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist , but from someone who is already dead    
shinohara heavy industries , the premier labor manufacturer in japan ( if not the whole world ) , has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors' movement speed and efficiency by 30%  
this hyper operating system , hos for short , has very quickly been installed into well over 90% of the nation's labors    including the patrol labors of sv2  
since that installation , dozens of labors , including a heavily-armed military model , have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason    and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos  
 ( some wags have compared this to windows 95  ) 
it's up to asuma shinohara , labor command officer with sv2 and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries , to find the source of these problems before more labors--including sv2's own--fall victim to them , and before hos drags his father's company down with it  
as was the case with _ghost in the shell_ , if you just want a no-brainer actionfest , this might not be the movie for you  
_patlabor : the movie_ is more of a psychological thriller , a technological suspense drama  
it is closer , perhaps , to a chrichton novel than to an action movie ( crichton novels that have been made _into_ action movies notwithstanding )  
there are long , thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo , similar to sequences from _ghost in the shell_  
this movie is fraught with symbolism--in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism  
patlabor's near-future setting is , aside from the giant robots tromping around , very similar to our own present day  
the film uses this setting to make its central point : is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up ? 
are history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new ? 
this is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor's alternate-1999 setting  
as far as the technical aspects of the film go ( referring to the subtitled version , as that's the only one i've seen ) , the film transfer is clear , almost phenomenally so  
the animation quality is incredible , though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to  
the oavs and tv series were more cheerful , better-suited to humor ; the movie , however , makes everyone look a great deal less cute , and emphasizes that this is going to be , for the most part , a deadly serious storyline  
as far as cinematography goes , there are many interesting moments in _patlabor : the movie_  
i don't think i can recall ever seeing a fish-eye perspective used in any other animated film ( save for _ghost in the shell_ , another oshii film ) , or indeed , in many other movies at all  
the cinematography is well-suited to the storyline , emphasizing what it needs to , though a couple of scenes ( where characters' features are exaggerated in anger ) may seem slightly strange to western audiences  
the audio track of _patlabor : the movie_ is in glorious hi-fi stereo , and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems--it _is_ that good  
even without headphones , sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to _come_ from that side "

1,"seen may 19 , 1999 at 5 p  m  at the crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n  y  ) , theater #1 , with my brother john for $8  50  
[theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats , sound and picture] 
 ( critic's note : this review is the longest i've ever written and still only scratches the surface  
i'd recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis  ) 
as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ? 
never mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old  
never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released  
never mind that there's so much going on in this movie in terms of plot , action , special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn't cover everything  
and also like ted does in all of his reviews , i'll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader  
before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film , many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film , skip this and the next four paragraphs )  
as has been made obvious for the last several years , another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars' series ( the first of the films was actually episode four , not one )  
george lucas , the creator of the series , has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , ' `the empire strikes back' and `return of the jedi' ) is actually the second trilogy , chronologically  
in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can't recall his reasons  
with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err    
second trilogy    
well you know what i mean )  
and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which , unfortunately , may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution  
[critic's note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed , but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule  
critic's note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics' law of reviewing movies , which as roger ebert coined , `it's not what a movie is about , but how it is about it  ' 
because so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story  ] 
first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it  
we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire  
we know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side  ' 
we also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi )  
what we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth  
to me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity  
also , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended  
most notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine  
for those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least )  
with `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights  
unfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained  
i didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness  
if you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? )  
but i digress  
i've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself  
all these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself "
1,"i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video  
it really scared me , and i didn't want to go see it  
however , after i heard about how wonderful it was , i wanted to see it  
i didn't get a chance to do so , until now  
the film , disney's 25th animated feature , opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale : a long time ago in the land of prydain , there was a king so evil , that his spirit was captured in the cauldron  
it has been hidden for centuries , and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors , and with them rule the world ? and destroy it  
then , we meet a farmer-wizard , dallben , and his young apprentice , taran  
taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a `pig-keeper' ( they have a pig named hen-wen )  
one day , as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath , the pig goes crazy , and dallben then realizes , after watching hen wen's thoughts through a bucket of water , that taran must hide hen wen in the forest  
an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron , and only hen wen has the power to show its location  
taran leads hen wen into the forest , but of course , he loses her , and tries to go find her  
along the way , he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi , who desires `munchings and crunchings' , much to his dismay ( besides , he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen )  
when he hears hen wen's squeal from far away , though , he races to her rescue ? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants  
taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king's castle from far away  
taran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen  
he manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon  
there , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls  
along the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie  
the three manage to escape the horned king's castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic  
as they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen's trail  
he leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of `pig tracks' , to a whirlpool  
suddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy-like fairfolk  
taran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva  
he then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world  
with the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage  
it turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place  
when taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ? in exchange for his sword  
taran agrees , much to eilonwy's horror , but at least they get the black cauldron  
but ? the cauldron can't be destroyed , only its evil powers can be stopped  
the only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive  
things take a turn for the worse when the horned king's henchmen capture taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr , along with the black cauldron , and lead them back to the castle  
taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors ( this is the most horrifying scene in the film , because here , a dead army comes alive ? )  
just when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr  
taran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away  
gurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay  
taran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king  
he kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely  
taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king's castle just as it self-destructs  
the witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they `never give anything away , they bargain'  
in response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi  
the trade is made ; gurgi's seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group  
as taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs-he is not dead after all ! 
the happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return  
as spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times "

1,"who would have thought ? 
jim carrey does drama  
when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show , i thought , "" what a hilarious idea for a movie ! "" 
however , it was an even better premise for a drama  
the truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man  
that man is truman burbank ( jim carrey )  
truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly , cristof wants to keep it that way  
christof is the "" god "" of this made-up world  
he keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles  
there were a few attempts to tell truman about his world , but they failed and life went on as normal  
the opening parts of the film introduce to truman's world  
we see what he is doing at his current age , then we get a flashback at his past  
it may seem a tad boring , but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start  
the film can be described in one word : weird  
it seems like such a simple idea , yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of , but andrew niccol did  
it seems like a warped idea , but it is andrew's idea and he did wonders with it  
jim carrey actually lived up to the hype  
the hype , whether good or bad , always focused on carrey's ability to do drama  
no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be , the only thing they doubted was carrey  
and he showed them all up  
jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars  
i do not think he was the best actor , but he deserved the nomination  
he plays truman burbank , the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world  
he has lived a normal life for almost thirty years , but then strange things start happening  
he ventures into the wrong elevator  
a light crashes in front of him  
his father comes back and is then pulled away  
we are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show , but truman does not  
and it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish  
carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama  
laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife  
she plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point  
peter weir does not make the cast perfect , and their flaws eventually lead to truman's escape  
the story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down  
despite carrey's greatness , the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris , who plays the "" god "" of truman's world  
he displays the pressure he is under , the world he has created  
he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life  
the action moves at a good pace , and rarely gets sluggish  
but , the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show  
it really makes you think  
maybe your brother is an actor , maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show  
some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking  
or when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for truman's arrival  
and when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon ( noah emmerich ) delivers his dramatic line  
all of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative "

1,"big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america  
o  j  
simpson , tom capano , the menendez brothers  
all these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms  
and , of course , courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood  
whether it be john grisham's thrilling novels or television's famous dramas , the courtroom has always provided big bucks  
so when i rented a civil action , i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker , a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat  
however , what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected , a major surprise , but fortunately , a pleasant one  
john travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it  
no one expected him to light up the screen in grease , nor in saturday night fever  
but , whenever he gets knocked down , he always seems to come back fighting  
a civil action is not john's best performance , but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998  
travolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations  
his performance is not flashy , nor memorable , just solid  
if he delivered the only solid performance , this film would still be average  
luckily , he has a strong supporting cast  
william h  macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood  
he continues to deliver great performances one after the other , but he is still regarded as a secondary actor  
in a civil action , he delivers yet another great performance as travolta's paranoid and greedy accountant  
he is not a lovable character , but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film  
he is not one of the big time lawyers , just a measly accountant  
but , he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998 , but there is actually someone better in a civil action  
robert duvall is also an underrated actor  
he gets many leading roles , but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks , brad pitt and jim carrey  
duvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the co-defendant  
duvall is magical in this role  
he is the wise teacher , who not only battles it out in the courtroom , but also manages to teach every major player a lesson , in his own twisted way  
in many non-comedic films , directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy , to keep the audience on their toes  
unfortunately , they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny ( jar-jar binks , anyone ? )  
however , this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed  
this is not the case in a civil action  
they have comedy coming from all sides  
whether it be duvall's inane questions or macy's sharp anger , the laughs come in a steady pace  
granted , it's not roll in the aisle funny , but it provides a nice addition to the film  
the plot is terrific- somewhat  
the setup is nice with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom  
then the case that will make or break jan ( travolta ) 's career rears its ugly head  
they find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it  
however , budgets soon flounder and jan finds himself in deep debt  
i will not spoil the rest , although i must speak of the one downside to the film  
the courtroom debates are great , but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored "

1,"will hunting ( matt damon ) is a natural genius  
for a movie character , that's usually a death sentence  
it's a trait associated with what my brother calls "" too good for this world "" movies , like phenomenon or powder  
forgive me for spoiling the ending , but will doesn't die  
this is no formula movie  
in fact , it's quite fresh and original  
it's a character study more than anything , and that's not surprising , considering it was written by two actors : damon and co-star ben affleck  
will works whatever kind of job he can get  
first he's a janitor , then he works construction  
off-screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him  
on-screen he hangs out with his friends , picking fights in robust , romanticized-hemingway fashion  
lambeau ( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves ) , a math professor , learns that the janitor ( will ) is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics  
having confirmed he's not a fluke or a savant , he does what he can to get will into the education system  
he is firmly rejected  
finally , will lands in jail for one of his fights  
lambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him  
will ( barely ) decides to go for the therapy over prison  
lambeau treats will like a son  
he's proud of , and amazed by , will's accomplishments in mathematics  
he encourages will and tries to give him structure , knowing that , with a little discipline , he could be bigger than einstein  
will isn't really interested in academia  
he knows he would be the best in his field , and therefore spend all of his time in an office , explaining math to people like lambeau  
he would rather work construction , which breaks lambeau's heart  
meanwhile , will attends his mandated therapy sessions  
it's not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau's "" a "" list  
will has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade , and how to keep them from affecting him  
shrink after shrink refuses to return after will's mockery  
lambeau's last hope is his old college roommate , now a psychology teacher at a small-time community college  
knowing that will is going to try to shred him too , sean ( robin williams ) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein  
true to form , will finds sean's emotional weakness and attacks  
but unlike the other shrinks , sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions  
like a foster mother with a fussy child , sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride  
like the foster mother , sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach  
robin williams is excellent in this role  
he's not an actor with a great range , but in the right roles he has great depth  
in this movie , as in awakenings , there comes a point when the quiet , shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance , and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes  
williams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling  
i have compared will to a foster child and that's not entirely fair  
emotionally , he has a lot to learn , but he is not a child  
he has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants  
sean , his girlfriend , his pals , and lambeau all help him grow , but he didn't start out asking for , or particularly needing , help  
his exceptional gift singled him out , and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction  
if i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama "
1,"an energetic , visually stunning , but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne d'arc  
in history jeanne d'arc is lost in an ocean of mystery and controversy , which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and creative directors , who can basically alter the story as they wish  
she came in a time where people desperately needed a saint  
a hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and happiness  
director/writer luc besson ( 'nikita' , 'leon' ) portrays his version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france and was burned at the stake for witchcraft  
besson tries to recreate the person behind the legend  
he tries not to show her as a saint or a villain  
he shows her as a human being  
in a time where blood was almost pouring from the sky , and the air smelled of rotten flesh , it is hard to keep your sanity  
the only support and hope is in god  
at the age of 13 , jeanne ( milla jovovich ) watches her own sister murdered and raped by the english soldiers  
this terrible event makes a lasting impact on jeanne's mind  
god is no longer her support  
he has become her obsession  
she starts seeing visions and signs that command her to raise an army and free france from the siege of the english tyranny  
with the help of the wise yolande d'aragon ( faye dunaway ) and charles vii ( john malcovich ) , whose grand royal ambitions and life are at stake , jeanne raises an army and marches towards the english walls  
after this the film stays mostly on the battlefield , where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing action sequences , only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo  
the movie is filled with dreamy , symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship , that create a surreal and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere  
the film is lost in time and space , hysterically jumping back and forth in jeanne's thoughts , imagination and conscience  
besson's visual style permits the audience to enter the medieval age , feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle  
but the film is far from being flawless  
the script needs a lot of polishing  
except for jeanne , there are no real characters  
and although a grand star cast is assembled , their characters are nothing more than props , not more alive than the costumes that they are wearing  
as for the maiden of lorraine herself , she is portrayed as a simple girl , too small for her divine task  
in the latter part of the film , we see her as hysterical , confused and on the brink of madness , with her past purity and innocence for ever lost  
jovovich handles the part with more panache than one might expect  
but though her screen time is incredible excessive , both malcovich ( 'being john malcovich' ) and dunaway ( 'titus' ) surpass her rather overacted and simply unprofessional performance  
and even hoffman manages to breathe some life into his dreadfully small part  
besides casting jovovich , besson's only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting  
there are some viscously evil englishmen that murder , pillage and betray with a smile on their faces  
and some incredibly brave and noble frenchmen , represented by the "" three musketeers "" of this story -- the brave gilles de rais ( vincent cassel ) , the wise aulon ( desmond harrington ) and the strong la hire ( richard ridings )  
though all those actor perform well , their characters are nothing more than symbols -- banners that proclaim the glory of france  
and thus , there is no sense of realism in this film  
'the messenger' has muscles instead of brains  
there is some relief in the end , where besson lays down his armor and starts thinking  
dustin hoffman's appearance helps and the film ends elegantly and surprisingly effective with a climax worthy of praise  
jeanne's character is unlocked , but whether god was in the picture or not , is never quite explained  
was she a confused peasant girl driven by her own hunger for revenge ? 
or was she truly a messenger of god ? 
the film poses as many questions as answers and nothing is completely obvious  
bess o messenger' is nothing more than a fairly good film  
it is not much that you remember of it after you leave the theater  
maybe the sound , the dreamy sequences , but certainly not the dialogue  
it is an elegant and adrenaline pumping history lesson for the mtv-generation , that although presents some interesting material , works better when it's on the battlefield "

1,"for example , in happy gilmore , sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self-confident jerk of a pro  
if the star were any other comic , that would be enough motivation to drive the movie , but with sandler , the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house  
that extra motive doesn't make happy gilmore a funnier movie  
it doesn't really add any genuine emotional depth , either  
in fact , the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie  
but sandler's philosophy seems to be , if it's a token gesture , why not make it a nice gesture ? 
that is endlessly refreshing  
in the wedding singer , sandler is right on track  
the fact that he's a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story  
what kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important  
david spade could have filled the role with cynicism and sarcasm  
he could make fun of the fat , ugly , or embarrassing people he meets at weddings , and the story would be intact  
but sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character  
he seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family  
robbie hart ( sandler ) doesn't just sing at weddings ; he also gets the loners to join in and have fun , and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing  
he is exactly the man you would want at your wedding  
the day comes when robbie has his own wedding , and he is stood up by his heavy-metal bride ( the movie is set in 1985 )  
robbie takes it hard  
he doesn't sleep , he doesn't eat , and he gets punched out at work when he sings "" love stinks "" at a wedding  
julia ( drew barrymore ) , who waitresses all the weddings in town , gives him a shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to  
eventually , robbie starts rebounding toward julia  
he really likes her , but she's engaged  
her fianc ? is a self-confident jerk ( do i see a trend - nope , just a formula ) who doesn't deserve her , but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand  
julia seems to like robbie too , but she can't leave her seemingly safe and stable fianc ? for the off-chance that robbie might be serious about her  
you know the story  
you've seen it a million times before  
there's always a new way to tell it , with new lovers , new chemistry , and new details , but it's the same story  
and sometimes , it works  
the wedding singer works  
first of all , the chemistry between sandler and barrymore is effective  
actually , it's not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each one's own romantic tension  
sandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man , struck with an unattainable love  
barrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with  
sparks don't fly when they kiss , but they both seem right for each other  
second , their love is mature  
they are not driven by passionate sexual attraction - they're a cute couple , but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material  
instead , they are both looking for someone meaningful , someone to settle down with , someone to grow old with  
at a wedding , robbie comforts a kid throwing up in a dumpster while julia sits by  
the repulsing situation is taken in stride , as if the two were already parents , caring for their sick child  
the ? 80s soundtrack and references play a big part in this movie  
other critics liked this movie in part because of the '80s soundtrack  
i liked it in spite of the soundtrack  
often , the music and references felt forced  
for example , robbie tells his ex-fianc ? to "" get out of my van halen t-shirt before you jinx the band and they break up "
1,"truman ( "" true-man "" ) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey's character in this film  
president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide , in spite of ( or was it because of ) his stature  
 "" truman "" also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war , an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans  
and burbank , california , brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc  
if hollywood is the center of the film world , burbank is , or was , the center of tv's world , the world where our protagonist lives  
combine all these names and concepts into "" truman burbank , "" and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world  
truman leads the perfect life  
his town , his car , and his wife are picture perfect  
his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky  
the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart  
  
  
but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light ? 
the next day during the drive to work , the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements  
he is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian  
when the radio comes back to normal , the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully  
his suspicion aroused , he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities  
the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator  
the elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks  
a grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door , made to look like the back of an elevator , into place  
two security guards grab him and throw him out  
truman is really suspicious now  
it gets even worse the next day when his wife , a nurse , describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge  
 "" it's best not to think about it , "" she says , trying vainly to change truman's memory  
truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense  
at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town  
his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world  
you know by now that truman's life is the subject of a television program  
his actions are "" real "" but everything else is carefully scripted , from the death of his father to the choice of his wife  
truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is  
meanwhile , christof , the all-seeing creator of truman's world does his best to keep him unaware and happy  
it's sort of like westworld told from the robots' point of view , or jurassic park from the dinosaurs' point of view  
we root for the captive of the cage-world  
our protagonist is counting on "" chaos theory "" to help him escape his elaborate trap  
the story , written by andrew niccol ( writer/director of gattaca ) , introduces some interesting questions , such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life , or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake  
although these questions came to mind , i don't think the film itself asked them  
it certainly didn't address them or try to answer them  
i was particularly disappointed that the film didn't deal more with the trauma of learning one's life is a tv show  
carrey's performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman's pain , but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film's pacing  
earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well  
the two seemed exclusive of one another , but weir and niccol didn't see it that way  
perhaps it's not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn't , but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here  
but on its own terms , the movie is well made  
sight , sound and pacing are all handled competently "
1,"it is with hesitance that i call "" apocalypse now "" a masterpiece  
certainly , it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made , with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease , and some of the finest actors of the 1970's  
the plot , an adaptation of joseph conrad's "" heart of darkness "" , was set in vietnam , and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant , coming on the heels of the end of the war  
 "" apocalypse "" certainly has its moments , some of which are the finest in film history  
the plot is fairly simple  
captain willard ( sheen ) , is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty  
his mission is simple : take a boat up to cambodian territory , and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz ( brando ) "" with extreme prejudice ""  
along the way , willard runs into a series of adventures , including one with lt  col  kilgore ( duvall ) , and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies  
willard' s four person crew finally make it to kurtz' compound , where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives  
willard's experiences with kurtz take up the last half-hour , with a confrontation and eventual ending  
the movie is visually breathtaking  
the battle scenes are exquisitely done , and the score is brilliant , setting a murky mood of darkness that is first-rate  
the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening  
the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning , and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie  
the journey to kurtz' camp is quite a ride , with psychosis setting in on almost every character  
the most interesting one is kilgore , the lt  col  who cares more about the surf than about the mission  
it is at times revolting , psychotic , and incredible , and it is one hell of a movie  
the scenes are bold , inventive , and powerful , and the acting is stunning , especially be sheen , duvall , and fishburne  
the narration is exquisite , as is the mystery of kurtz  
coppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam , kind of like "" saving private ryan "" on lsd  
the film is jarring in its implications , and psychotic in its execution  
the problems come when the film slows down  
one of the major scenes in the film , where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz , is a colossal mess  
the dialogue is confusing , the lighting is atrocious , and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film  
the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound  
the film slows down to a drag  
sheen seems forever captured by a madman , played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received  
brando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes , but is bathed in shadows the entire time , making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic  
the scenes are poorly done , the dialogue is muffled , and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief  
sheen seems to adore this man , but why the viewers are never told  
the entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god-like kurtz , but the scenes fall way short of expectations  
granted , it has its moments , which are brutally horrific , but the general feeling is one of confusion  
brando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir , and my feeling was that this could never be a great man , this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him , so why do they do it ? 
there are moments of brilliance , but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene  
there are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending  
the finest scene at the end is sheen's escape , and his entrace into the temple  
his rise out of the water , with the smoke coming off of his slicked head , is a brilliant 30 seconds of film  
yet , you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done  
the psychotic ride is unforgettable at times , and indeed the film on the whole is very good  
it is a stunningly flawed expression of film , for it addresses major issues , such as man's mental stamina during bouts of war "

1,"slavery is bad  
after hundreds of years , we've finally figured that one out  
this almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg's latest "" serious "" film  
during the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa's west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery  
fifty-three of them are stuffed into the "" la amistad "" ( from a spanish word for "" friendship "" ) by their new spanish owners  
freeing himself from his chains , senge pieh ( djimon hounsou ) , renamed cinque by his masters , leads a bloody revolt  
after killing most of the crew , the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home - or so they think  
instead the ship heads up the coast to the united states  
the amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy  
the legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property  
if they are property , who do they belong to ? 
their masters ? 
the spanish government ? 
salvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ? 
the us government ? 
the defendants are pawns in several games  
abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause  
their lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees  
south carolina senator john c  calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states  
president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends  
when the verdict looks to free the africans , van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes  
even that doesn't work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims  
at the urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave-owners  
this little-known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america's past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court  
the slavery issue is easy pickin's for spielberg  
much like his "" shindler's list "" ( which followed "" jurassic park "" as this follows "" lost world "" ) , the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose  
nazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human  
it's not hard to see who the bad guys are  
without that question to ponder , the director's job is more difficult  
he has to make the story interesting  
spielberg succeeds for the most part  
the visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach  
where the movie falls down is a bit more subtle  
there are very few _people_ in the tale  
in fact , cinque is the only character who is fleshed out  
tappan and joadson are "" abolitionists "" : symbols but not humans  
van buren is a weak politician but nothing else  
the rest of the "" slaves "" barely exist other than dressing for the set  
like many other films about people of color , almost all the major players are white  
the film's salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou  
the former model's first major role is a winner  
without speaking more than five words of english , he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog  
the other stand-out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents ( he also played the title role in "" nixon "" )  
the impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court-room drama ever on the screen  
there are some other great moments  
especially impressive are the african's struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land  
their interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant "

1,"the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do  
lives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice  
the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower  
most of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants  
it takes a pretty smart person to do that  
but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? 
what if he's also able to think on his feet ? 
in fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? 
it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f  gary gray's the negotiator  
in this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l  jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force  
when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder  
faced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office  
i don't quite remember if the captain actually said , "" i hate to do this , but    "" , 
although it wouldn't surprise me if he did  
luckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above  
after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j  t  
walsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed  
although roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue  
jackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman  
the actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats  
the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence  
how can we believe he's going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? 
unfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson's acting ability  
almost every time he's in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back  
when spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course  
his is an interesting character  
made out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation  
 "" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , "" he says  
when he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be  
soon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail  
this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor  
as the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely  
gray really lucked out with this cast  
david morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey  
the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d  a  
in l  a  confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land  
with the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven  
also in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides  
his character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything "

1,"the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes , and the greedy trade federation has used it's armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo  
we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo's ruler , the young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) to sign a treaty giving the federation control  
however , the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade  
no sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi , and the first battle begins  
it seems that for me and thousands of people like me , the love for george lucas's trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time  
we're the fans , not the freaks  
we won't go dressing up like darth vader ( although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool ) , and we won't incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations ( not all the time , anyway ) , but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest , we're throwing down  
all right , stop looking at me like that  
we have been faithfully and patiently waiting  
waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll  
you see , the trilogy is not just a set of movies , but a religion of sorts to we , the faithful disciples , and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah  
unfortunately , it is not our savior  
for weeks beforehand , i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good - stupendously good - miraculously good  
anything less and it'll be the biggest disappointment of the century  
i didn't want the doomsaying prophecy to come true , really i didn't , but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking  
character development is virtually nonexistent  
with the possible exception of qui-gon , most of the film's characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions  
none seem very affected by their experiences , and few even show any passion at all  
contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks , a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo , in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala  
jar jar's life is saved by qui-gon early in the film , and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh ( or supposedly so )  
his speech mannerisms are so "" cute-ified "" that i couldn't understand a third of what he was saying , and the slapstick he performed was just distracting  
his head gets caught in an electronic field , his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast , he describes being in trouble as "" deep doo doo , "" and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport  
therein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors  
in star wars , we had obi-wan telling us mos eisley was a "" wretched hive of scum and villainy  "" 
in the phantom menace , we get doo doo  
the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story "" a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away     "" 
this film , on the other hand , constantly reminds me that it's only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience  
perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition ( it's kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses ) , and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500-like play by play  
i liked the pod race ; it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension , but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters ? 
the race would have been even more exciting without the distraction  
this aspect , coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me  
i suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer , but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all ? 
didn't millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again ? 
didn't the action figures still sell like hotcakes ? 
of course they did , and it's only poor judgment that allows the most-eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults  
one aspect that will appeal broadly , however , is the use of special effects  
the people at lucas's industrial light and magic , the world's premiere effects house , outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer-generated images and real-life footage  
some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed , especially the shots of a land battle between the federation's robot army and jar jar's countrymen  
the space battles are also impressive , although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer  
this , however , is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today  
john williams is back , of course , providing a score for the film as only he can  
his music is pervasive throughout , as rousing and as dramatic as ever , always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately  
since this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine-episode story ( star wars , the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four , five and six , respectively ) , the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already , in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar  
as a result , attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin "

and so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer season  
austin powers 2 , the sequel to the sleeper hit of 1997 , is filled to the brim with uproarious sight gags and lurid toilet jokes that will make you keel over with hilarity  
the mind of mike myers is obviously a very bizarre place  
myers returns as the swinging 60's spy and his arch-nemesis , the bald headed dr  evil , who is given much of the spotlight here  
there's an early scene in which dr  evil and his son scott ( seth green ) appear on a jerry springer segment entitled `my dad is evil and wants to take over the world' , hosted by springer himself  
most of these talk-show gags , spoofing everything from oprah to regis and kathie lee , are no longer as funny as they once were  
happily , this is an exception , especially when a fight breaks out between dr  evil and the other guests  
 ( sample dialogue- `come back here you mother #@%$^ ! ! 
you want a piece of me ? ' ) 
the audience was in stitches  
there are many good things about this sequel  
dr  evil is now assisted by mini-me ( verne troyer ) , a pint-sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry  
mini-me is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for , and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does , pinkie and all  
mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina , evil's loud-mouth assassin sidekick , and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber  
this works surprisingly well  
afterward , there's even a meeting at the coffee machine , where their awkwardness is expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment  
oh , yes    
the plot  
after a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington ( elizabeth hurley ) that goes disastrously wrong , powers is back on the case to thwart the diabolical plans of dr  evil  
in the original , the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods  
here , it's time travel  
dr  evil has this crazy plan to steal austin's mojo ( the source of his sexual powers ) , so he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when powers is still is his freezing chamber  
there , he employs a grotesque 600-pound scottish assassin named fat bastard ( also myers ) to commandeer the mojo , so that our future hero is left completely shagless  
meanwhile , austin is informed of evil's wrong-doing by basil exposition ( michael york ) , and is supplied with his very own time-traveling device in the form of a volkswagen beetle  
once back in 1969 , powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell ( heather graham ) , and learns of dr  evil's plans to destroy washington dc with a lazer on the moon  
in one of the many uproarious jabs at star wars , evil calls the moon base a `death star'  
if there ever was a movie that knew from the start it was a complete joke , it's austin powers : the spy who shagged me  
ap2 has many hilarious moments , much more so , than the original austin powers  
but what it doesn't have is the confident support system that the first boasted , and the jokes are now more scattershot and hit-and-miss  
while myers has a knack for delivering clever , inspired gags , he sometimes doesn't know when to call it quits  
the hilarious scene in the original involving mustafa ( will ferrell ) and his refusal to die is played out here in a disappointing and tired manner  
robert wagner , as dr  evil's #2 man , has only one scene early on in the film , where he lacks all the focus of the character  
one nice surprise is rob lowe , as the young #2 , who patterns wagner's voice and movements right down to a tee  
there are more recycled jokes from the predecessor , including kristen johnston as ivana humpalot ( an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina )  
but myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project , and many bits are side-splittingly funny "

1,"denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances  
this perhaps may be washington's very best to date  
he joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent , this season , to become his character , copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly  
his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting "" the hurricane "" a much better film than it actually is  
when his rubin "" hurricane "" carter feels pain and is tormented by racism , he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy , disgust , and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices  
the horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago  
the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone , as his tortured carter , sum up the troubles of racism in america's history  
he is that amazing  
the problem with "" the hurricane "" is that when compared to washington , all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles  
mainly because the script focuses so much on carter , that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors  
this is , without a doubt , washington's movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying , it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars  
denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance  
as rubin carter , we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system  
>from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit  
then after a successful marriage and boxing career , he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder  
carter's second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous , powerful white men who refused to let him succeed  
from these past experiences in jail , carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america  
after several court appeals , an autobiography , and many public marches for his freedom , carter remained locked in prison  
it was not until a young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carter's book in the 1980's , that a serious battle for freedom took place  
the young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released  
the greatest scenes in the film are when carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation  
washington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again , he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career  
the devastation in washington's eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it  
in the hole , carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he cannot  
his anger is heightened to a point of no control  
we see multiple carters , a violent angry one , a silent passive one , and a mediator  
we see an emotional boxing match inside carter's head  
from this point in the hole to the end of the film , this fight continues  
it is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite  
when carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison , the angry carter at first erupts  
white people have been trying to hurt him his whole life , this reminder leads to anger in his head  
however , as the film continues and the canadians continue to help carter we see the calm side him  
he realizes that society is changing  
that racism is decreasing and now carter wants to leave jail immediately and become a part of this world  
very rarely have i seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here  
if only the other actors had this same determination  
dan hedaya , ridiculously plays the man who sends carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around  
it felt like his character was taken straight out of a "" scooby doo "" episode ; he would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for those annoying little kids  
 "" the kids "" in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable  
the lawyers who help release carter also are underused , as is clancy brown as a kind prison guard ( the complete opposite of his character in "" shawshank redemption "" )  
there is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears  
hedaya was superb in "" clueless , "" same for david paymer in "" get shorty , "" harris yulin in "" ghostbusters "" and liev schreiber in "" the daytrippers  "" 
it is a mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles "

1,"no humans were harmed , tested or tasted in the making of this film  
all recipes are fictions  
twentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism  
a psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul ! 
director/writer antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts , but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves   
 ""   they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive   "" 
this true story , briefly mentioned in "" the shining "" , has no turned into a 143 minutes long motion picture  
in 1847 , the united states was a land of pioneers , of gold-starved americans making their way west  
it was a period of manifest destiny , the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries , stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could  
capt  john boyd ( guy pearce ) has become both a "" hero "" and a victim during this period of relentless consumption    
in ways he could never have imagined  
boyd's journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific mexican-american war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost , a waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california  
upon his arrival he is greeted by a small , motley group of soldiers , including his commanding officer , hart ( jeffrey jones ) , a previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life ; toffler ( jeremy davies ) , the fort's personal emissary to the lord ; knox ( stephen spinella ) , the veterinarian that plays doctor , who never met a bottle of whiskey he didn't like ; reich ( neal mcdonough ) , the no-nonsense soldier of the group ; and the seriously "" over-medicated "" cleaves ( david arquette ) , a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions  
into this cold , bleak and bizarre world staggers a stranger , colqhoun ( robert carlyle ) , a half-starved scot who had been traveling with a group of settlers until they became snowbound  
seeking refuge in a cave , they soon ran out of food - and were forced to consume one another  
colqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors d'oeuvre himself  
our heroes then decide to journey through the mountains to find the survivors , and colqhoun tags along to help out  
soon it becomes clear that colqhoun's tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will to survive  
it involves an old indian myth called weendigo , which states that a man who eats the flesh of another steals that person's strength , spirit and very essence  
his hunger becomes an insatiable craving : the more he eats , the more he wants , and the stronger he becomes  
there can never be enough , and death is the only escape   
it's all fairly sickening and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the whole movie through  
as professionally made as the movie is , you have to wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this  
teen-age horror fans won't care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell  
older folks might show up when they hear that the movie is actually a satire about the pioneer spirit , but they'll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces  
but jokes aside , this is a film that is well worth watching  
it has wonderful and mature characters , that few horror film s can boast of and a strangely effective story that continues to electrify you till the end  
the two main characters are also the most interesting  
boyd is a simple , honest man tiered of war , killing and fear  
his sacred wish is to live a normal , quite life away from gunpowder and blood  
colqhoun is different  
he proves that a man , on the brink of death , would do anything to stay alive , including sacrificing his own soul  
he believes so much in this indian myth that he starts to change physically  
it is the power of the human mind and conviction that make miracles happen  
the atmosphere in "" ravenous "" is macabre and bizarre , scary and surreal  
completely isolated from the rest of the world , stands fort spencer "
1,"you've got to love disney  
no matter what they serve up , it is a guaranteed success as long as it's animated  
kids have to go see the movie  
then they have to get the toys  
oh , the video came out ? 
got to buy it , or risk little billy's temper tantrums for the next month  
all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca : a visit to the magic kingdom  
stay at the disneyland hotel ! 
buy a disney t-shirt ! 
eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick ! 
it's both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it  
dale carnegie should have had it so good  
what's most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality  
you see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot  
the theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not  
the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same  
however , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box-office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer  
luckily , disney's latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula  
the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan-yu ( miguel ferrer )  
soon , china's emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china's defense  
when the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household  
fearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming-na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army  
mulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling  
mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman's role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that "" grace "" is not one of her strong points  
very early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one's family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task  
by leaving home to fight in her father's place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too  
as is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film  
i'm not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time  
both lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan's army unit and obligatory love interest , are more than competent , although salonga's voice translates much better to animation  
you have to hear it to understand  
interestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan  
there is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie  
it is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney's own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing  
artistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically "" disneyfied "" ethnic tale  
there are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan-yu's hun army , which utilizes the same computer-enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast  
the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it  
when mulan resolves to take her father's place , she dons her father's old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword  
as she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal  
it just left me thinking , "" that was really cool  "" 
a wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon-tek oh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang's conscripted army  
even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan  
although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance  
i found the choice of b  d  
wong as shang a little strange ( you may remember him as martin short's wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride ) , but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast , so i guess anything's possible  
in any event , wong performs admirably as well  
one character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa "

1,"after hearing reviews for woody allen's upteenth movie in history , "" celebrity , "" range from terribly boring to just so-so , my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of "" manhattan , "" my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time  
woody allen's films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair , so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand-in-hand ( "" manhattan "" really is one of the best-looking films i've ever seen , beautiful black and white photography of the city's best areas , etc  ) , a fan can't help but feel visibly moved  
the film opens up , with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds , and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack , but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky , with the word "" help "" being spelled with an airplane  
beethoven's 5th blasts on the soundtrack  
the city seems to stop to take notice of this moment , and it's all rather lovely to look at  
and then we cut to a film crew , shooting this as the film's hilariously banal key moment in the film , where the lead actress in the film ( melanie griffith , looking as buxom and beautiful as ever ) has to realize something's wrong with her life or whatever  
it's a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film , with the great opening shots or without , and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again , a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works ( though , for the record , last year's "" deconstructing harry "" came awfully close )  
what the hell has happened to him ? 
the man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny , but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas  
 "" bullets over broadway , "" though wonderful , relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off  
 "" mighty aphrodite "" is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story  
 "" everyone says i love you "" was more of a great idea than a great film  
even "" deconstructing harry "" is admittingly cheap in a way , even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films  
if anything , the reception of "" celebrity "" by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time , it's not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is : it's him  
 "" celebrity "" is , yes , a good film , but it's only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film  
instead of creating the great woody allen world , he's created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about  
and he's fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities , so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections  
it's like "" la dolce vita "" without the accuracy , the right amount of wit , and the correct personal crisis  
woody , becoming more insecure in his old age , choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities , and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny , and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead  
much has been said about his performance - dead on but irritating , makes one yearn for the real thing , blah blah blah - but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh's performance , though featuring some of the same mannerisms ( stuttering , whining , lots o' hand gestures ) , is hardly a warts-and-all impersonation  
branagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm , which actually allows for his character's flaws to be more apparent  
woody's a flawed guy , and we know it , but we love him anyway , because he's really funny and really witty and really intelligent  
branagh's allen is a bit more flat-out bad , but with the same charm so that , yes , we like him , but we're still not sure if he's really a good person or not  
his character , lee simon , is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie , hits on extra actress winona ryder , then goes off to interview griffith , who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her , and she denies him    sorta  
we then learn , through flashbacks , that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid-life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion  
he has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts , covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate , so that he can meet them , and maybe sell his script ( a bank robbery movie "" but with a deep personal crisis "" )  
as such , he has divorced his wife of several years ( allen regular judy davis ) , and continues on a quest for sexual happiness , boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film  
after griffith comes his escapades with a model ( charlize theron ) who is "" polymorphously perverse "" ( glad to see allen is using new jokes , ha ha ) , who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of "" la dolce vita  "" 
following are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen , a relationship that almost assures him success , and his continued escapades with ryder , whom he fancies most of all  
his story is juxtaposed with that of davis , who flips out , but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome , friendly tv exec ( joe mantegna ) who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status  
while lee is fumbling about , selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness , davis becomes happy ( "" i've become the kind of woman i've always hated    and 
i'm loving it  "" ) 
without doing a thing  
the result is a film of highs and mediums  
the mediums are what take up most of the film , with sitations and scenes which don't exactly work but you can't help but pat allen on the back for trying  
but other places are really great scenes  
the opening  
the sequence with theron , which is so good that i wished it hadn't ended "

1," "" the blair witch project "" was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses  
its success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted  
after the release of "" the blair witch project "" , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch  
locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig-sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie , and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , "" get out of these woods and go home ! 
there is no goddamned blair witch ! ""  
jeff ( ) is one of those people , who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage  
after he got released from the mental institution , he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet  
as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the "" blair witch hunt ""  
among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend , the pregnant tristen , who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called "" the blair witch : history or hysteria ? "" , and kim , who dresses in black and has some psychic powers  
the last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch-wannabe , who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying "" the first rule of wicca is , do no harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold  "" 
this strange group plunges into the woods , where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience  
on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr's abandoned house , strange things start happening  
when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain  
after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies  
they are somehow lost in time , as it loops uncontrollably back and forth  
they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality  
the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods   
documentary director joe berlinger ( "" paradice lost "" ) helms "" blair witch 2 "" , leaving the creators of the first film ( dan myrick and ed sanches ) in the background  
the opening scenes--the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film-- is a more promising approach , because instead of trying to cover similar ground , it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand  
but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story , that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue  
in a way , this is a typical hollywood sequel  
more money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail  
the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated  
of course in these situations , quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values  
from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest , with carter burwell's ( "" being john malkovich "" and "" fargo "" ) musical score in the background , you realize that with the exception of its title , this film has absolutely nothing to do with "" the blair witch project ""  
 "" blair witch   "" 
was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation  
in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection , creating a completely different atmosphere  
with its graceful cinematography , production design and flashy editing , the film has a very polished look , which is impossible to associate with the first installment  
and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times , he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor  
the key is simplicity  
 "" blair witch project "" had a story which was incredibly simple  
that allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination  
the film was practically an empty screen , on which we projected our most frightening nightmares  
the effect was incredibly powerful , lasting and entir e everyone , but in a different way  
 "" book of shadows "" feels incredibly controlled and restrict  
here , very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and "" clever "" that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it  
there is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with  
this is simply a less artistic film that doesn't have the talent and originality of its predecessor  
it resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesn't always succeed  
but most importantly : it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie , which doesn't allow it to destroy the original  
in the end , i can't call it a bad effort "
1,"call it touched by a demon  
gregory hoblit's fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist  
if marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven  
in fact , there's even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion's share of the weirdness distilled out  
 ( remember bob ? ) 
the biggest failing of fallen is that , although it's consistently interesting , it's not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope  
a serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice  
now , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , "" what goes around really goes around  "" 
shortly thereafter , he begins to sing "" time is on my side "" as he's taken on his last walk  
minutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead  
but for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn't a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel  
and , with reese's death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will  
only hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they're up against  
the rest of the cops , including hobbes' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don't have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger  
as depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one  
no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown  
the most famous landmark to appear isn't the liberty bell or independence hall ; it's geno's steaks  
shadows and night scenes abound  
the days are cloudy and unpromising  
this is the kind of setting where it's easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men  
fallen's plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized  
somehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise  
but the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check  
nevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks  
the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual  
of the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance  
john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick  
sadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel  
everyone else , including denzel washington , is boring  
washington's flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film  
it's not that he's bad per se , but he's not very interesting  
there's no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes  
as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was  
washington's subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency  
however , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler's list ) and donald sutherland  
to be fair , the flaws in their characters aren't all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written  
that said , however , there's nothing inspired about either davidtz's or sutherland's work  
both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual  
narratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses  
although the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters  
at times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like "" i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself "" become a little hard to swallow  
in addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel  
however , despite the negatives , i'm still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved  
the final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected "

1,"andrew lloyd webber's musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time  
webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as "" oklahoma ! , "" or the slapstickness of shows like "" a funny thing happened on the way to the forum  "" 
they instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics  
like "" jesus christ superstar , "" which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune "" superstar , "" a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn't spread his message wider ) , "" evita "" takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things )  
 "" evita "" deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn't like di slept to "" the top "" )  
webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it  
here , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad  
it's also a musical , with almost no words not unsung  
the film plays like a rock opera , much like their "" jesus christ superstar , "" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one  
after all , this is a musical , and webber's musicals never undermine this  
they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side  
this is why the beginning of "" evita "" is kind of a let-down  
okay , it is a let-down  
i'm not saying the opening moments are bad , because they're pretty good  
but what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand  
in the musical , it's a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , "" buenos aires , "" which is also lifeless  
then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , "" another suitcase in another hall , "" which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva  
the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it's being narrated by a hater of eva's , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light  
for a while , it looks like alan parker can't pull it off  
however , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song "" goodbye and thank you , "" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful  
from this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical  
no more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact  
we see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer )  
more importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work  
juan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory  
a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before  
>from the "" goodbye and thank you "" number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation's people downtrodden  
but despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star  
that's when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she wasn't the great woman she really was , and expose her fame  
describing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he's said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can't help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death  
alan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he's done "" fame , "" "" the committments , "" "" bugsy malone , "" and "" pink floyd the wall "" - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is  
we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented  
his direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is  
and there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings "" don't cry for me , argentina , "" and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is  
madonna's golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film  
at the beginning , she looks like she's too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s )  
her death , though , is brilliant  
her singing could be better though  
i know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she's trying to hard  
she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like    patti 
lupone - i heard her sing on an old "" evita "" cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) "

1,"one of the sweetest tales to ever be made , it's a wonderful life isn't perfect , but its good natured charm and beautiful performances light up the screen with glorious results  
probably the greatest "" feel-good "" film of all time , it's a wonderful life aims for the heart , and strikes with a golden arrow  
on christmas eve , george bailey ( stewart ) is being prayed for by many in the small town of bedford falls  
you see , george is in trouble , and he has always helped others who needed it  
this one time , however , god answers his prayers , and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence ( travers ) to try and save george  
clarence has got his own problems , however  
clarence is an angel without his wings , and each time the bell rings , the wings pass him by  
the bailey case is a way for him to earn those magical wings and become a true angel  
but before clarence can save george , he first has to go through a cliffs notes version of george bailey's life  
we see george sacrificing his hearing to save his brother's life , sacrificing his college education to save the family business , sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother , and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else  
when the bank his family owns is in trouble , george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure the bank isn't sold to the evil mr  potter ( barrymore ) , who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls  
one christmas , potter gets his chance  
uncle billy bailey ( mitchell ) loses $8 , 000 of the bank's money  
without the money , the bank must close down  
george is stuck in a tremendous bind , and contemplates suicide  
clarence , the faithful servant , is there just to pick him up , and to show him what bedford would be like without george  
this is all a lead-in to the very famous last scene , where george finally sees what true happiness is about  
it's a wonderful life does have its faults  
the movie is beginning to feel dated in the details , especially in the treatment of women and men  
the sex roles in the film are weirdly out of place in the 90's , like something out of a revisionist look  
all the men drink too much and slap their wives too much during some portions of the film  
there are , however , endearing moments in all of this  
capra puts in just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the 50's to make the movie remarkably enjoyable  
the story is hackneyed , and the ending feels , well , a little too sugarish  
there's this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything , especially the sequences where george is either in trouble , or helping somebody  
it's a little too nice for my liking , at times  
there is , however , enough humor , enough wit , and enough of jimmy stewart to get the movie through the middle part , which would be the most difficult  
but watching it's a wonderful life is never boring or difficult : it's always interesting , right until the finale , which , for all its sugar , makes delightful sense and is beautifully done  
capra does have his monumental cliches , but the actors relish them and overplay everything to perfection  
donna reed is perfect as the loving , obeidient wife , and lionel barrymore is gloriously grump as mr  potter  
everyone else is magnificent , including bert and ernie ( ward bond and frank faylen )  
there is a general sense of goodness , as if everyone in the film knows that they are making a great film , and they relish that  
stewart , however , is the king of all of this  
he is sometimes awkward , especially when saying "" merry christmas "" to all objects , animate or inanimate  
but he is james stewart , and he's lovably delightful throughout the film  
have i complained ? 
i shouldn't have  
this is a really good movie  
no , this is a great movie  
better yet , this is a phenomenal movie  
there is a reason classics are invented : to make sure that people will always have great movies to aid them in their quest for living life  
this is one of those films "
1,"assume nothing  
the phrase is perhaps one of the most used of the 1990's , as first impressions and rumors are hardly ever what they seem to be  
the phrase especially goes for oscar novak , an architect who is the main focus of three to tango , a delightful , funny romantic comedy about assumptions and being yourself  
novak ( matthew perry ) , a shy , clumsy , chicago based architect , along with openly gay partner , peter steinberg ( oliver platt ) , fights for projects day in and day out  
one of these is the job of restoring a popular building for charles newman ( dylan mcdermott ) , a rich , well-known businessman  
charles immediately takes a liking to oscar , as he enjoys his personality and sense of humor  
seeing oscar as someone he could trust , charles asks him to watch his girlfriend , an unpredictable , adventurous girl named amy post ( neve campbell ) , who makes a living by blowing glass  
charles wants to know who she talks to , what she does , and where she goes  
the point ? 
to make sure she's not seeing someone else , of course  
oscar gladly takes the job , and meets amy at an art show of hers , and sparks fly between the two from the get go  
oscar feels he has found the one meant for him , and he is content with the idea of being with amy  
well , another popular phrase of the 90's is "" all good things must come to an end , "" and this stays true for oscar as well  
charles walks in on amy and oscar having a drink one night , as oscar and amy have become great friends , but he doesn't seem to mind  
why is this ? 
he thinks oscar is gay  
he's not afraid to share this with him either  
oscar stands in shock after the words , "" i swear if you weren't gay oscar , i'd have to kill you , "" are muttered flamboyantly from charles' mouth  
the word spreads instantly through town  
will oscar "" come out "" of his supposed gayness , or will he tell everyone that he isn't ? 
one would immediately think he would deny the fact , but numerous occurrences come to oscar , which result in the fact that if he denies the fact , he could lose his job with charles  
matthew perry doesn't escape his character as chandler on the already classic t  v  
comedy "" friends , "" as both oscar novak and chandler are clueless , shy , and sensitive  
nonetheless , perry is hilarious here , and shows that he can handle drama , as obviously , his character suffers quite a bit here  
it's wonderful to see neve campbell outside of a horror movie , ( she was the star of scream 1 and 2 , and the upcoming scream 3 ) as she handles comedy superbly here  
her voice , smile , and personality are more than perfect for romantic comedies- stay with this genre , neve  
neve is delightful as her conflicted character , who feels love for oscar , but knows , based on rumors , that he is gay  
as usual , campbell is likable as her likable character  
unlike the other two leads here , dylan mcdermott is flat in his dialogue , and is never convincing  
when his character his present , mcdermott sets a dull tone to the scene with his horrible acting  
stick to the t  v  
drama , the practice , dylan  
the major weak spot in three to tango is the direction of damon santostefano  
no originality or technique is used whatsoever  
three to tango is lucky that the script is so edgy and that perry and campbell are wonderful in comedy , or else the film would have been a disaster , as it is just plain boring to look at  
three to tango is a film done many times before , as the plot is suspiciously close to 1998's the object of my affection , but the plot has never been completed so well  
three to tango's script , written by rodney patrick vaccaro and aline brosh mckenna is fun , fast , and funny , delivering not only original , hilarious gay jokes ( not your run of the mill material ) , but a certain snappiness in the dialogue between characters that always keeps you smiling  
unlike last summer's south park : bigger , longer , and uncut and 1997's in & out , three to tango is a comedy in which the gay element is not crude or vulgar  
the script is wise to take this route , as gays can't ( i don't think so , anyway ) be offended by this light , playful comedy  
 ( to prove this , a gay couple was in the audience who were laughing constantly  ) 
three to tango's climax is a hilarious , clever scene that is pure irony based on the outcome of most romantic-mistaken identity comedies  
three to tango is a gem  
the bottom line : three to tango is a light , sharp , snappy romantic comedy with a superb ending , and great stars  
one of the better romantic comedies of 1999 "

1,"by now i figured i'd seen every alfred hitchcock film at least a half-dozen times -- not that i'm complaining  
to call him the "" master of suspense "" is an understatement  
the paradine case ( 1947 ) , admittedly one of hitchcock's lesser movies , turned out to be one i'd missed  
this one , like all hitchcock films , is well worth savoring  
the story opens with the rich mrs  maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her home for poisoning her blind husband  
as mrs  paradine , alida valli plays an aloof but alluring woman of the world  
to franz waxman's stark and moody music , we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments and jewels  
stripped of her fine raiment , she becomes a commoner again , which , as it turns out , was what she was before she met her husband  
 "" a brief skirmish , and you'll be lunching at the savoy again , "" anthony keane , her ultraconfident attorney tells her in their first meeting , predicting a fast and easy trial  
gregory peck plays the successful and debonair barrister  
 "" she's no murderess , "" he argues simplistically , smitten by her beauty  
 "" she's too fine a woman  "" 
his attitude upsets his beautiful and increasing jealous wife , gay ( ann todd )  
unlike most hitchcock movies , which are centered on the thriller and the mystery , this one is more a romantic melodrama  
typical is the scene in which gay flings her head back and shakes her hair while bathed in light  
she deflects her husband's affections as she fears that he is beginning to fall in love with his client  
the dramatic music then comes up high as the camera dwells on mrs  paradine's portrait nearby  
in the relatively unsatisfying first half , little happens other than domestic squabbles and overtones of intense adulterous desires  
to the sound of sweeping violins gay tells anthony that he must get mrs  paradine acquitted because , if mrs  paradine dies , his heart will go with her  
if she is freed , he will be able to forget her  
as part of the soap opera , a mysterious louis jordan plays mr  paradine's valet , who has had some not to be discussed relationships  
charles coburn plays anthony's legal partner , sir simon flaquer  
and charles laughton , who looks like coburn , is judge lord horfield  
this being proper british society , they will all dine together at the judge's house not long before the case begins  
court tv junkies will probably pick up the many differences , some subtle and others not , between the american and the british judicial systems  
one , for example , of which i was not aware is that the barrister cannot speak to his own client during the recess if she is the process of testifying  
one sometimes wonders what the academy is thinking when they make their oscar nominations  
as the judge's wife , lady sophie horfield , ethel barrymore got a nomination for best supporting actress -- the film's only nomination -- for an inconsequential part with which she did little of merit  
 ( so the big question is when does hitchcock make his obligatory walk-on ? 
at 37 minutes into the film , he leaves a train station carrying a large musical instrument case  
don't miss it  ) 
in the second half the story finally comes alive when it gets into the courtroom  
the great master shows his hand there as the tensions build as rapidly in the second part as they lay fallow in the first  
watch how the camera angles are sometimes from the back and other times from way on high to set the exact tone for the trial's action  
as anthony explains it , the simple case has only 3 possibilities : mr  paradine poisoned himself , mrs  paradine did it , or the valet did it  
the end includes many devastating revelations and some nice twists so it is too bad the first half is so languid "

1,"let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films  
i'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years  
i'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film  
by that point , it was evident that mr  bond was back with a vengeance  
all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience  
it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts  
it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in  
i guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain  
anyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond  
i think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films  
there were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined  
and bond's last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series  
the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series  
everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007  
for the most part , the action sequences worked very well  
although , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film  
i think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted  
while he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film  
most noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie  
he almost seemed like he didn't know what he was doing  
but they were brief scenes and really shouldn't take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing  
if you have ever seen a bond film , you won't be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit  
the world is not enough is no exception  
this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world  
007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain  
why this point is included is beyond me  
they took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought  
anyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid-east oil pipeline  
i guess world domination just isn't as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore  
bond is brought in to protect the pipeline's owner , elektra king ( sophie marceau ) , who is the daughter of one of renard's recent victims  
along the way , bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist , dr  christmas jones ( denise richards ) , and his old rival valentin zukovsky ( robert carlyle )  
like all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words  
my biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films  
there was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing  
the buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau's character  
it was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film  
later , it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something  
but because it is a bond film , the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly  
after all , it isn't shakespeare  
how about the cast ? 
brosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007  
i grew up with the roger moore version of bond , so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character "

1,"in "" the sweet hereafter , "" writer/director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living  
he shows us how it isn't dying that hurts , but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death , and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings  
on a cold winter day in a small , isolated town in british columbia , a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake , where it cracks through the ice and sinks  
fourteen children die , and numerous others are hurt  
for the residents of this small town , all of whose children were on that bus , it is an earth-shattering event that resolutely alters their lives  
they have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain , but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle  
alberta and risa walker , who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident , hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ( ian holm ) to bring a lawsuit against someone , anyone for responsibility  
the bus driver , dolores driscoll ( gabrielle rose ) , is a kindly woman who loved the children and , although she lives with a burden of guilt , is not held responsible for the accident  
the bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice , and there was nothing should could do to prevent it  
however , according to stephens , there are no "" accidents "" in life , and someone will pay for this tragedy , whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through  
he goes through the town , approaching the parents who have lost children , asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger  
and , for his work , stephens will receive one-third of the settlement money  
however , it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money  
he is driven by something else , something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents  
he has lost a child , too , but not in the same manner  
his daughter , zoe ( caerthan banks ) , who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite , has been in and out of drug re-hab clinics and detox stations for ten years  
she calls him on an irregular basis , begging him for money , but refusing to tell him what she needs it for  
 "" i don't know who i'm taking to , "" he tells her  
in his mind , his daughter is dead  
the lawsuit is , to stephens , not only a way to mend the town's pain , but also his own  
however , not everyone in town wants it to happen  
billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children , wants nothing to do with it  
he has already lost his wife , and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman  
he doesn't want to talk about the accident , and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds  
to him , the town should be able to take care of its own pain , and it doesn't need outsiders like stephens getting in the way  
central to "" the sweet hereafter "" is the tale of nicole burnell ( sarah polley ) , a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into "" a wheelchair girl , "" as she puts it  
aside from stephens , nicole is the most complex character in the film , and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out  
it is also her sad , haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack , reading robert browning's poem about the pied piper , and how when he led all the town's children away , one was left behind because he was crippled  
obviously , nicole is that child , and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town's children left her alone by dying in the wreck  
her situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving , but incestuous relationship with her father ( tom mccamus )  
there is only one , fleeting scene that suggests this relationship , but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film  
of all the storylines in "" the sweet hereafter , "" this is the most complicated and unresolved , although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film  
egoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers -- if any at all -- and he doesn't condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up  
what egoyan has done in "" the sweet hereafter "" is really nothing short of miraculous  
in his adaptation of the novel by russell banks , he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss , and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life  
egoyan has always been a talented , but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold  
 "" the sweet hereafter "" is quite the opposite ; egoyan's stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion , and draw the audience into the tragedy  
 "" the sweet hereafter "" seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked  
the film is filled with beautiful , subtle performances from all the actors , especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind  
the beautiful , roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting , melodic musical score by mychael danna ( both previous egoyan collaborators ) give the film a visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements  
like his earlier films , egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing whole  
he works with time as a fluid substance , shifting back and forth between the past , the distant past , and the present with effortless ease  
the actual bus wreck itself doesn't happen until midway through the film , but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail , and still have it carry great , devastating weight "
1,"one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made , "" se7en "" is just a few steps away from brilliance  
however , those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss  
the film received mixed reviews upon release , but there's an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice  
at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing , but the script and the ultimate pay-off are excellent  
the shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable  
this piece of work is 100% intensity  
it's uncomfortable to watch , yet compelling  
 "" i want not to look , yet i cannot turn away  "" 
the story creeps along slowly and deliberately , crafted by visionary director david fincher  
he has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions , but not giving away too much too soon  
this is the guy who directed the ominous "" alien 3 ""  
 "" se7en "" is even more ominous because the threat is real  
it's human and , while the script takes some artistic licence , the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic  
that is , if a human being could be so intelligent , patient , wealthy , and disillusioned  
after the most bizarre opening credits i've ever seen ( refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment ) , the initial character development takes place  
morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset , a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society  
brad pitt co-stars as detective david mills , the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys  
these two fine actors give the film its human qualities ( along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow , who plays tracy , mills' wife )  
however , none of them stands out above the material  
no disrespect intended , but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same  
an ironic note is that somerset has only a week ( or 7 , that's seven , days ) left on the force to train his young protege  
the title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins , as chronicled by john milton in "" paradise lost "" --gluttony , greed , sloth , lust , pride , envy , & wrath  
incidentally , i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found  
it's the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking , but i won't give that away  
as i said , this has a great ending and no one should spoil it  
anyway , the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the "" sinners "" suffer for it  
the two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man  
they learn that he was murdered--forced to eat himself to death  
the killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and , of course , somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way  
if they didn't , it would be one short movie ! 
the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story  
we see a lot of blood , but it's not especially violent  
the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown--like most of the violence in "" pulp fiction ""  
 "" se7en "" is gory , graphic , and disturbing , but all the gore is post-death  
still , if you tend to get queasy , don't eat food during this film  
kevin spacey plays john doe , the avenging angel who claims that he's the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings  
like many crazy men , he has some fine ideas , but some sick ways of expressing himself  
spacey doesn't appear until the final 30 minutes and also doesn't receive billing in the opening credits  
however , it's his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination  
a great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not  
this character is so well written that it's hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone  
no serial killer has ever been so creative  
 "" se7en "" is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and it's often a little too depressing  
what it lacks in those areas , it makes up for with believable dialogue , top-notch screenwriting , unexpected twists , and realistic characters "
1,"more than forty years ago , the "" sword and sandals "" genre of historical epic ruled the box office  
during the 1950's hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope  
 "" ben-hur  "" 
 "" cleopatra  "" 
 "" the robe  "" 
 "" sparticus  "" 
 "" the fall of the roman empire  "" 
 "" quo vadis  "" 
sometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood  
since then , epics have appeared infrequently ( "" the last emperor , "" "" braveheart "" ) and some of the best have been small-screen affairs produced in the 1970's ( "" roots , "" "" shogun "" )  
yet , the phrase "" we who are about to die salute you "" has been absent until now  
 "" gladiator "" begins in germania in a  d  180  
roman general maximus ( russell crowe ) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting  
however , the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) will prove a poor successor , so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again  
when commodus hears the plan , he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered  
maximus escapes from the executioners , but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son  
a caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa  
 ( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus' place is never explained  ) 
an african named juba ( djimon hounsou ) treats maximus' wounds  
proximo ( oliver reed ) , a gladiator who won his freedom , purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena  
of course , maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier , and his fame spreads  
when commodus reopens the coliseum , proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete  
our hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus' sister lucilla ( connie nielsen )  
the similarities to "" braveheart "" are obvious : an evil king , a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family , the aid of a lovestruck princess  
also , like mel gibson's epic , "" gladiator "" has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero's anger  
it's a simple tale of good versus evil  
maximus has all the manly virtues : nobility of purpose , courage in battle , loyalty to king and country , physical stamina , and devotion to family  
commodus is his opposite in every way : a sniveling , selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience  
the opening night crowd in my theater was about 70% male , and that seems appropriate  
 "" gladiator "" is a guy movie ( would the opposite of a "" chick flick "" be a "" dick flick "" ? )  
there's much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences  
 ( those easily offended by gore should stay away  ) 
lucilla is the only female character , and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife  
joaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance  
in the scene where commodus kills his father , phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father's love or pride  
throughout the picture , phoenix manages to give depth to a character who's scripted as a caricature of evil  
i've been a russell crowe fan since "" romper stomper  "" 
this role doesn't offer him the complexities of his parts in "" l  
a  confidential "" and "" the insider "" -- essentially his job is to grunt heroically -- but his voice , which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp , is perfect for the genre  
the late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role "

1,"one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable  
you know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is  
sure , it's been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch  
this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun  
one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story  
this rule applies highly to kiss the girls  
there is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made  
however , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through  
well , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up  
unfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits  
that may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery  
however , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film  
plotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality  
we are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero  
he gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself  
obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene  
at his house , cross is told that his neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been missing for four days  
this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can't sympathize with detective cross  
however , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees    
before she is abducted  
dr  kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd family ) is a smart , athletic woman , and because of these traits , becomes a target for casanova--what the serial killer likes to call himself  
because of these character-developing scenes , we care for mctiernan , making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful  
after being abducted , mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods  
remembering that the killer gave her certain rules , she decides to break one of them by calling out  
when casanova comes to punish her , she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall  
after she is found , she begins to help cross find his neice  
from this moment on , kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film , as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive  
many people will compare this film to 1995's seven , another killer film starring morgan freeman , but i presume that the similarities are intentional  
the screenplay , by david klass , is adapted from the novel written by james patterson , and yet i don't quite see how this story could have worked in novel form  
what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness  
the cinematography , by aaron schneider , is reminiscient of seven , and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us  
sometimes a simple shot is the best one  
however , many of the shots are stunning , and unlike seven , most of them take place during the day , in sunlight  
the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done , in more than one way  
the camera work is terrific , but the editing makes this scene work so well  
the chaotic and mtv-type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness , exactly what judd's character is experiencing  
however , the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors  
morgan freeman is one of today's most powerful and believable actors  
detective cross is a very good character for him , although it is just a similar one to the character in seven  
because of freeman's powerful presence , he carries half the film by himself "

1,"i'm not really sure what to think about "" crash  "" 
on the surface , it's a cold , boring , unerotic porn with name starts , a name director , and some cool camerawork  
i mean , it left me completely bored , unsatisfied , and generally kinda weirded out  
but then again , not every film's supposed to leave you entertained  
 "" crash "" is structured to play like a porn flick , but with significantly more plot and dialogue  
while we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex , we also have a skimpy little plot going on ( mostly towards the beginning ) , and maybe just a hair of characterization  
not to mention the acting is generally pretty good , and we don't really see a lot of the actors completely exposed  
but what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience  
this film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of "" henry and june "" or the just plain horniness of , say , "" deep throat "" ( not that i've seen it )  
if one was to be made completely hot by this film , it would probably mean they were also into the whole "" auto eroticism "" thing  
the film leaves you cold erotically ( and maybe in many other ways ) , but what it does is present a group of people who live on the edge  
the film opens up on a woman , catherine ( deborah kara ungar , of "" the game "" ) , pressing her bare breast up against a car in a public air hangar  
suddenly , a man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind ( the film doesnt' show all this though , even if it is nc-17 )  
the next scene has a film director , james ( james spader ) , having sex with a camera woman ( alice poon ) in an office on the highly-populated set of his movie  
the next scene has the two coming together , revealing to us that they're husband and wife , and them sharing in one another's escapades  
while the two are arguably freaky people , we at least know they love to live on the edge  
soon afterwards , james is driving down the road at night , reclessly of course ( he's reading something ) , when he drifts into the other lane , and then hits another car face on  
james is not killed , but the passenger in the other car flies into his seat ( obviously dying ) , leaving the driver , helen remington ( holly hunter - in a porn ? ) , also alive  
the two go through therapy together , and when getting out , they run into eachother again  
when james gives her a ride home , they almost get into another accident , and immeadiately afterwards , they go to an unbusy parking lot , and have a little quickie , as they were aroused by the accident  
you wouldn't think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish , but they run into a freaky guy named vaughan ( elias kosteas ) and his crutch-carrying girlfriend , gabrielle ( rosanna arquette ) , who are also into it  
vaughan is into living on the edge as they are , but he takes it to another level : he loves to recreate famous car crashes  
in one scene , he and a friend , colin seagrave ( peter macneill ) recreate james dean's car crash without any padding or safety belts , and suffer some concussions , but nevertheless get a rush ( and the attention of the police )  
soon , these five are all having sex with one another , be it straight , gay , or lesbian sex  
while this is admittingly all a bit comical ( the film is almost like a black comedy ) , the film does do a pretty awesome portrayal of people who's main fetish is living on the edge  
i'm sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents , but i personally don't see a connection between car crashes and sex  
the main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush  
his car crash scenes are quick and exciting mini-masterpieces : we're at first not sure if they'll take place , but everytime it looks like it may occur , we gasp  
then when it happens , we hold our breath  
the same thing happens with sex , although not in the same fashion  
these people are merely taking it to another level  
the only problem with the film is that it's a tad redundant  
a normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and a half  
this goes on for about 100 minutes , and it just seems a little too long  
the sex and car crashes are far between one another , and the time between them are a tad on the boring side  
there's no characterization , although it could definitely be argued , that hey , it's a porn , and we're not here to sympathize  
but still , they coulda cut it down a bit  
but the film is saved with its presentation , as well as some other elements  
the atmosphere is very dark and forboding , creating a kind of cool weird feeling  
and there are several scenes are just amazing  
one scene has catherine and james having sex , while she softly asks him questions about being with a man , which sounds almost erotic the way she says it  
a sequence involving one character's death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs  
and the final shot is shot perfectly , creating an image of a car crash , and a couple having sex in front of it , despite the fact that she's wounded "

1,"showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven , director , and joe eszterhas , writer  
their last effort , basic instinct , played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry-spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone's taste , but certainly a well-crafted movie  
possibly that movie's greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage , prior to the movie , during the movie , and after the movie    
and that , after bringing all the plotlines together neatly , it left the viewer with full knowledge of what * would * happen in the characters' future , so there was no need to film it  
there was actually about four hours' worth of screen story there , but eszterhas found ways to get it all on-screen in two , by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on ; and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails  
the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls  
we have attractive , sympathetic , but still highly repellent characters ; we have shows for the eyes and the ears , plotlines that play on several levels , we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable , and we have a story of an innocent ( who may not be so innocent ) who's trying to play straight , trying to improve her station in life , who slips into behaving the way those around her do    
but recovers with a flourish , and quits a winner  
in this sense , the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven , who's not known for treating his characters well ; but nomi , the part played by elizabeth berkley , definitely opts out of the game in a positive way , and we're left feeling good about her future  
this is not one of the great movies , but it's far better than we'd been led to expect by all the negative pre-release publicity  
verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 , and in the last quarter-century has pushed farther and farther , experimenting with the socially-acceptable limits to movie-making  
his most recent three movies , robocop , total recall , and basic instinct , have been a progression of back-door access to american culture , moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives ; and now he's exploring the sleeze  
this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director's contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie  
 ( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating , although his original version is available on video  ) 
many reviewers have taken the politically-correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing ; but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies , it's about people in an environment where naked ladies are common , and why such an environment should exist  
it's about the scum who use other people as power-trip toys , and the need to escape their power  
it's about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don't pertain ; and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment  
an nc-17 movie which isn't sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty , power , or value  
the one scene in the movie that * could * have been a good sex scene , berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool , is not exciting , because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator  
if anything , it's a rape scene with a victim who's been duped into cooperation  
you don't make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors ; you don't make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed ; and you don't make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls    
and in an awful lot of vegas shows , an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing  
this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry , in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity  
showgirls de-glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness  
nomi is played , in a very good performance , by elizabeth berkley , who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who's at the end of her rope , desperate to live a life better than the one she's known  
she has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability , and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker , trying to be something better than she seems destined to be  
when nomi realizes she's gone too far for too little , she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be  
gina rivera plays molly , a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi , providing her with what may be the one solid , positive relationship in nomi's entire life  
molly is the one who makes the difference , and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she'll be using for the rest of her life , and nomi's feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi's decision  
gina gershon plays cristal , an aging , but still very attractive starring dancer , a reflexively competitive manipulator who's become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her  
gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch ; a fading talent made bitter by self-awareness  
her character is very well drawn and performed ; in a major scene in a hospital room , she acknowledges what she is , and , in essence , passes the torch to nomi  
the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie , and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path  
it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe ; molly is an honest , hard-working person who means well , and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality  
cristal is a talented dancer who's compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a co-operating part of the system , exchanging self-respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas  
nomi believes she can make it without selling herself , succumbs to a degree , and then realizes she can make it without selling herself , and doesn't need las vegas or its brand of "" stardom  "" 
the male parts in this movie are simply props ; they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist "

1,"in 1977 , something never though possible happened  
the film star wars was released , with extraordinary , never seen before techniques of special effects  
the film set a new standard for special effects in film  
not only did it set a standard for the special effects , it set a standard for film itself  
the plot is one of the most creative i heard ever  
the legend of star wars starts long ago with the jedi  
the jedi were warriors who were wiped out by the dark side  
darth vader is the leader of the dark side  
ben obi-wan kenobi , played by sir alec guinness , was one of those jedi who is still alive today  
darth vader was once a jedi , until he turned to the dark side  
years after the killing of the jedi , darth vader is still around causing trouble  
r2-d2 and c-3p0 are both what we call "" driods "" , or robots that are of assistance to humans  
while an attack on the ship that princess leia , played by carrie fisher , is aboard , she inserts a message to r2-d2 , who is also on the ship  
to obi-wan kenobi pleading for help  
the princess is captured by vader , but r2-d2 and c-3p0 get away on an escape pod that eventually lands them on the remote planet of tatooine  
the jawas , or small creatures who sell droids , pick r2-d2 and c-3p0 up to sell  
they are bought by luke skywalker's ( mark hamill ) family  
while luke is cleaning the droids , the message from princess leia is found  
luke finds this obi-wan kenobi , and learns that obi-wan was a friend of luke's father , who is now dead  
luke also learns his family was a jedi  
after luke's family is killed by tropps from the dark side , ben decides to put luke through training to stop the dark side and destroy them once and for all  
ben wants to create a new jedi  
first , the two must find princess leia and serve her  
han solo , played by harrison ford , and his sidekick chewbacca , played by peter mayhew , are consulted about providing a ship to complete the tasks necessary  
after meeting up with leia , the film really picks up  
luke continues his training as a pilot and to become a jedi , ben kenobi confronts darth vader , and many other interesting events occur  
star wars is an amazing epic  
the plot is so original and amazing , i cannot believe it  
the special effects , especially for its time , are wonderful and realistic  
the space scenes in particular are the most fun to watch  
the ships flown by all are very unique and creative  
the costumes are also out of this world  
the scenery is so different from anything i have ever seen before  
there are a variety of different very memorable set pieces that will stay with me forever  
the entire premise of star wars is amazing  
the creatures and droids that we see throughout the film are one of a kind  
even the human characters are different  
every character is extremely likable and different from characters from other sci fi films  
the acting on everyone's part is great , especially that of sir alec guinness's  
even though the concept is not realistic at all , it is pulled off very nicely  
the acting , setting , effects , costumes , and sound make it work  
if any of these were messed up , star wars would have come off as one huge joke  
the ending works very well , and left it very open to the sequels that came afterward "

1,"in october of 1997 , audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer  
the film went on to gross over 70 million dollars in the u  s  , and even developed a cult following , much like the previous year's 100 million dollar grossing scream  
when the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend , it looked like a wonderful follow-up  
did it live up to the first film ? 
the answer is no  
jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james , a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before  
she has been so upset since the incident  
nightmares haunt her all over the place , but she has to move on  
she know attends college , and is best friends with a funny , outgoing girl named karla ( brandy ) , who is trying to hook julie up with will benson , played by newcomer matthew settle  
karla's boyfriend is tyrell , the funny , outgoing type , who is played by soul food's mekhi phifer  
freddie prinze jr  also returns as ray , julie's boyfriend from a year ago  
one morning , julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil  
of course , they answer it correctly , and they are off to the bahamas  
julie wants ray to come , but he declines the offer , so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie  
after they arrive at their hotel , it is just them and the staff on the island  
it starts off as the weekend of their dreams  
something just had to come to mess up the one care-free weekend of julie's life though  
ben willis ( muse watson ) is back , and he isn't letting anyone survive this time  
will ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one ? 
jennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances  
brandy in particular was impressive , considering this is her first feature film  
you could see that the characters were horrified , and they would do anything possible to survive  
matthew settle and freddie prinze jr  are a completely different story  
let's start with settle  
matthew is completely fake in this film  
you could not believe a word coming out of his mouth  
you could tell he was acting , and its reasons like him that this one isn't as good as the first one  
he does do a good job towards the end , but that doesn't clear up the scars he already left on the film  
freddie prinze jr  is almost as bad as matthew settle was  
he is almost completely unbelievable , and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place  
we don't see him as much as settle , otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did  
mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell , but yet again the dialogue is out of place  
the plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie  
i like where the filmmakers went with this second installment , but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one , it would have been a bit better  
the cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful  
there are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel  
the sound is pretty good , but still not as creepy as the first film's  
jennifer love hewitt's song , "" how do i deal "" is also played for about thirty seconds  
i still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film  
the first film was very suspenseful , and it contained some very memorable scenes "

1,"at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds  
that's true of home alone 2 and i'd bet money that it's true of home alone 3 ( opening soon )  
but home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way  
the mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays  
four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse  
the littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids' cruelty  
kevin's patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he's going to have to starve  
he attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him  
the fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle  
the knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin  
nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back  
the ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night  
on his way up the stairs , he tells her that "" families suck "" and that he hopes never to see any of his family again  
that night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport  
in a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him  
it's interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children  
first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class  
they're two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child  
meanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true  
he's finally rid of his family ! 
life is a dream come true  
he can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother's secret box  
slowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane  
he grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( "" i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener "" )  
he also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring  
the furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house  
macaulay culkin is cute but he isn't much of an actor  
still , we can see that kevin's character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing  
for example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as "" santa "" is getting in his car  
kevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa  
he learned how to deal with the furnace  
you turn on the lights and it's not so scary anymore  
he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer , who actually turns out to be a nice man  
they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid  
finally , in the last 20 minutes , kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally )  
this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick , and after the movie's genuine dramatic setup , it is dessert  
it's a lot of fun , and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the movie  
on the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie  
john williams' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls , and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings  
but it does have its flaws  
the smallest problem is that culkin doesn't act very well  
as i said before , he is cute , but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin's insight into his character  
the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda , the villains threaten kevin's life about five times  
instead of "" i'm gonna get that kid "" they say "" i'm gonna kill that kid "

1,"it's tough to really say something nice about a type of person who's so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone , but by god , "" american history x "" does it , and for that , i commend it  
it not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo-nazi skinhead , a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who's not what they are , and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off  
the subject of this film is one of them , but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack  
he's the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in another brilliant stroke , justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks  
he's so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process  
his name is derek vinyard , and he's played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he's almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as , say , malcom x  when we first see him , he's clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast , a devlish goatee , and he's attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets , at least when he doesn't need them  
he so believes in his convictions that he's willing to put his beliefs to the test , even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison , if only for a couple years  
 "" american history x "" is about derek , how he became a neo-nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake  
we see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager , a vicious hate monger , a man having an epiphany , and the man who tries to correct what he's done before - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all sides  
or at least , that's the intention  
the film's framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek's deep space 9 ) , is trying to "" correct "" him  
when the film opens , danny has just written a book report on "" mein kampf , "" landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek's life and how it has gotten him nowhere  
coincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he's cleaned-up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair  
he's just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he's wisened up  
he's no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who's becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle  
but danny won't  
he goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it a couple of years ago  
the film circles around this , then spins off into non-linear flashbacks , all done in black and white  
we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi-sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle-class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on  
to them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop , and he not only speaks elloquently , forcefully , and intelligently , but he backs everything up with political reasons , justifying their rage at least to them  
and frighteningly enough , much of what he says sounds true  
 "" american history x "" is a collection of really great scenes and moments , rather than a cohesive , great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next  
in it , there are some of the best scenes i've seen all year  
one scene features a dinner between derek's family , and his mother's newest boyfriend ( played with reserve by eliott gould ) , a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek's rightist views , launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience ( gould's reaction to derek's final summation is unnerrving )  
another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co-worker ( guy torry ) while folding laundry in prison  
and another soon-to-be-classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year  
there's much more to appreciate , like the acting , which is uniformly good , with stand-outs coming from avery brooks , beverly d'angelo ( as the long-suffering mother ) , and gould ( who has one horrible line , but other than that , comes off with the best performance he's given in what seems like a really long time )  
norton walks off with the film , though , coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble  
in only the fifth movie of his career , norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation , and maybe the best  
there's nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie , spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience , coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando  
that he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing  
sadly enough , this isn't going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be  
it's too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece  
the ending , especially , is pencilled in from other movies , tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon  
some of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches ( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the "" fat skinhead , "" whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more ) , and even the dramatic arc isn't as well travelled  
furlong's danny never seems to really be learning a lesson , since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view , and when he decides to make a change by the end ( which was inevitable ) , it doesn't seem like it has actually arrived there  
even derek's descent into skinhead-dom doesn't seem justified  
though his fireman father ( william russ , the dad from "" boy meets world , "" and don't ask me how i know that ) is killed by a black junkie , and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently , there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs  
as such , one can see why the director , tony kaye , wanted to have his name removed  
sorta  
 "" american history x "" is a very good movie , and i was very moved by it , but it could be a lot better , and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential  
somewhere , he claims , there lies a tony kaye cut , and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton , who then ordered another cut , and that is thus "

1,"_in brief : _ this film needs no introduction  
if you haven't heard of it , then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical , and if you haven't seen it -- well , i suspect you're in a small minority ! 
first thing's first ? is it all it's hyped up to be ? 
well , yes ? and no  
it's a good film , and there's a lot to like about it , but it's not without its problems  
when i saw the first trailer for "" titanic "" , it was when i went to see "" bean "" last summer , i think , my intial reaction was -- ain't that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real-life tragedy ? ! 
i mean , what's happened to hollywood's script-writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ? 
gads , whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ? 
i was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i wasn't alone in that respect  
it's when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) and anyone who'd been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice ! 
i didn't see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) , 
so i went with a slightly more open mind , but i still didn't think i'd enjoy it much  
did i ? yes and no  
mainly yes , i'm happy to say  
the first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i'll talk about that later ? ) but because the re-created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron's directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the "" human "" aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting  
the film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a' course ! 
 : - ) )  
well , it's an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat  
does it work here ? 
in script form it doesn't add all that much to the story  
what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film  
her presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her  
also impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving  
it's an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack's "" rescuing "" rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching  
in fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance  
it's engaging , touching and very enjoyable  
there's more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well , simply because you know it's not going to be a happy ending  
which leads us to the second half of the film  
we all knew it was coming  
i'm sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it , because as he's stated in interviews , the real thrust of the story ( for him ) was the sinking , and the jack/rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film  
i think that understates the importance of the romance , as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die  
the iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour  
and it is an hour  
my goodness , we don't miss a second of that hour ? 
gratuitous ? well , perhaps not by today's standards , i'm sure there's been far worse produced under the banner of "" entertainment "" in other films  
but i certainly wasn't prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be  
not that i'd expect the word "" understatement "" to be part of cameron's vocabulary ( he who brought us such , umm , vivid films as "" terminator 2 "" and "" aliens "" )  
is it overdone ? 
i thought so  
understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy  
no , no one expected a happy ending , but i didn't quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film's second half  
still , whether it was overdone and heavy-handed or not , if it was the shock-factor cameron was after it worked , because i was shocked and moved , in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears ! 
you really couldn't help but get emotionally involved , whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose's overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack , or that jack would rescue rose , or that they would both survive  
perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk , and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface  
the bit where rose lets go of jack's hand , while promising she'll never let go in her heart was particularly heart-wrenching , and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image , to put no fine a point on it  
i loved the ending , however , which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half  
so , we've established that the film is powerful and moving , if the last hour was rather excessive  
haven't mentioned the script  
plot-wise it's ok , though the jack/rose relationship was beautifully developed , but i've a feeling that's to the actors credit if anything  
as for the dialogue ? well , titanic is set in 1912  
it's a period drama  
but i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned  
did they really use phrases like "" goddamn it ! "" 
back in the turn of the century ? 
i doubt it  
would someone talk like this : "" do ya love the guy or what ? ""  
i doubt it "

1,"trekkies , roger nygard's energetic and hilarious documentary , brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions  
the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non-fans alike  
 ( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs  trekker polemic as not worth arguing about  ) 
the good-spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable , loud giggles , yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe  
denise crosby , who played tasha yar on "" star trek : the next generation , "" serves as the host  
in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary ( oed )  
 ( the oed cites a february , 1976 caption in the "" new yorker "" as the first recorded usage of the word  ) 
unless you've been to the conventions , i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans  
one pointed out , apologetically , that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate  
others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended , several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of  
my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams  
arguably the most famous of all the trekkies , she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die-hard fans do  
her claim to fame is that , as a juror on the whitewater trial , she wore it in court as well  
 "" every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcan-like stoicism , "" she says , describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession  
she doesn't quite understand all of the uproar  
 "" i'm an officer of the federation 24 hours a day , "" she reminds us  
her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith  
along with the laugher the show evokes , there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty  
and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment  
few other avocations could give this much satisfaction  
these people are having the time of their lives  
 ( for the record , i'm not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies  ) 
the film interviews the various star trek series's stars as well as its fans  
the stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and would soon fade , but over twenty years later , the conventions are still going strong  
filled with anecdotes , the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions  
at one , the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel  
after appearing briefly , he drank some water and left  
they decided to auction off his half-empty glass , joking that it had the "" q virus  "" 
the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too  
with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity  
not just flitting among people , the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies  
one guy is a trekkie cross-dresser , another dresses her cat , and then there is the dentist  
the dentist has his entire office made up to look like a star trek set  
he , his oral hygienists , his receptionist , his wife , and his kids wear the outfits all of the time  
it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home , but not his family  
for variety , he and his family do change characters from time to time  
he says his patients like it  
well , there was this one complainer , but he had a problem with his bill anyway

1," "" love is the devil "" is a challenging film , munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot , perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist's psyche rather than the artist's lifeline  
watching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter  
everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon , the film's subject , looked at it personally  
but while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what's going on  
exactly what was i looking at ? 
watching this film , i wasn't sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous  
directed ( and written ) by john maybury , "" love is the devil "" is stylish masterpiece for the senses  
everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing  
the camera angles are ferociously askew , and the close-ups are uncomfortably too close  
the editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon's world and psyche  
as such , there is no real story  
i've not heard much about francis bacon that i didn't read prior to the film , but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s , drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like  
he was one of the first to really come out of the closet , and in interviews , he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty  
as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi , he's like a foppish and self-absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero  
he lives life the way he wants to live it , to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him  
it's as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself ( "" champagne for my real friends , and pain for my sham friends , "" he says one night at the bar he frequents )  
 "" love is the devil "" chronicles the latter part of his life  
bacon , well-known in his mid-life , awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor  
he walks in , unafraid of what he finds , and discovers a thief , george dyer ( daniel craig )  
bacon gives him an offer : if he spends the night with him , he can take anything he wants in the morning  
george agrees to this , and off to bed he goes , but ends up staying with him , for whatever reason  
the film shows their lives together , at least in reference to one another  
while creating bacon's world of friends ( like "" high art , "" this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood ) , the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant  
bacon is haughty and bizarre ; george is simple and doesn't understand bacon in the least , especially not his paintings  
while watching this , that's basically all i thought was there  
the film has a hypnotic feel , free of any restraints of form , and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about  
once the film is over , it's easier to piece it together  
i kept on thinking about this film , wondering what the point to all of it was  
someone doesn't merely make a film of all style and no substance at all , and if they do , they do it by accident , but still allow some substance to creep in  
thinking about it , i remembered how the two fed off of eachother  
i thought about how bacon was a masochist , in love with cruelty ( in one scene , he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight , and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer's head splashes across his face ; in another scene , he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein's "" battleship potemkin "" ) , and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain  
he drove him over the edge , and for him that was love , even if it wasn't for george  
i guess that explains the title  
a bit  
that's great and all , but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning  
i wish it hadn't reduced itself to making some point about humanity , about how love is the most selfish thing in the world ( and it is , if you look at it a certain way )  
or maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man's twisted pysche  
it's almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man's uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience's throat  
that way you don't reduce your film to something it's just not  
i can't say i totally enjoyed "" love is the devil , "" though  
despite all of the things i respect about this movie , it's still rather uncomfortable to sit through  
even at a normally trite length of ninety minutes , the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through , especially after an exhausting first hour  
though hypnotic , it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times , as if it were taking advantage of one man's truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it  
as such , i respect the way the film looks "

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
on december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream  
although the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre  
the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes  
the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost  
scream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line's a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight  
and scream's rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion  
it's hard to understate this last point  
mr  williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director )  
indeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr  williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion's share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2's theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional "" a film by wes craven "" drapes the film's title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads "" written by kevin williamson "" , an affirmation of the screenwriter's contribution to the project which may be unprecedented  
 ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of "" a film by "" is attained  ) 
and , much like mr  tarantino's screenwriting , mr  williamson's work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters  
in scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels  
scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr  williamson's rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel  
while the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr  williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it's only at about the film's midway point when it becomes engaging  
like its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film's principal narrative ; this time around , we're following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the "" true life "" events behind the first film has been turned into a movie )  
however , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i've ever seen )  
there are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn't nearly as cleverly frightening as scream's ; while the first film's preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical  
flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film  
the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney  
they're joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded  
the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn't necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ? 
there's a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney's new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy's fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale's newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms  buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens' portia di rossi )  
any of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim  
as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit  
one problem that scream didn't have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer  
here ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr  williamson's screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery  
the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements  
 ( it doesn't help matters any that the killer's alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go  ) 
indeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes  
this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it  
while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it's head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences  
they're staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post-prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are much more fun to watch  
it's hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat-and-mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown  
in terms of its characters , the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ) "

1,"warren beatty's "" bulworth "" is a caustic political comedy that doesn't attack any particular political group , but rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system  
some might think this film is vulgar , and in many ways it is  
however , as loud and raucous as it is , "" bulworth "" speaks the truth , which is almost always ugly to hear  
beatty , who directed the film and co-wrote the script with jeremy pikser ( "" the lemon sisters "" ) , stars as incumbent u  s  senator jay billington bulworth , who has one of the best politician names in cinema history  
bulworth is a democrat , and in beatty's view , he is symbolic of everything that has gone wrong with the current democratic party  
once an ideological liberal ( like beatty still is ) , bulworth has long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington  
instead of waging the battles for the impoverished and the downtrodden , which was once the calling card of democrats , bulworth has become another sell-out money hound - if he's not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese , he's making wind-bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement , "" america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium     
blah , blah , blah  "" 
when the film opens , it is a few days before the 1996 primary elections , and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become  
in a fit of desperation , he takes out a $10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino ( part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee ) , and then hires a hit man to kill him , although he doesn't know who the assassin will be , or when the hit will take place  
knowing that he will soon be dead , bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world , which is made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics and the society in general  
at a compton church , he tells the group of african-americans that they will have no power in the u  s  unless they "" put down that malt liquor and chicken wings , and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife  "" 
later , in a particularly hilarious sequence , bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite , then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason he's there is because "" my guys always put the big jews on my schedule  "" 
all throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade , bulworth's chief of staff , dennis murphy ( oliver platt ) , follows behind in a state of constant shock and bewilderment  
platt has some of the movie's funniest scenes , as he makes murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet  
his constant half-truth-telling and spin-doctoring to cover bulworth's stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a self-righteous reporter ( nora dunn ) who acts like murphy's refusal to explain bulworth's actions ( something he really cannot do ) is somehow an act of treason  
when bulworth decides he wants to live after all , and therefore must constantly evade a grim-looking assassin to be who's trailing him at every turn , he hides out in the ghetto , complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears to one of his television interviews  
at this point , beatty abandons much of the political aspect and dives into a cartoonish exploration of the black inner-city experience  
bulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina ( halle berry ) , who he meets at the harlem church rally  
she has a tough-talking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l  d  
 ( don cheadle of "" boogie nights "" ) , who also becomes involved in bulworth's campaign  
some of the scenes in the ghetto ring true , but much of it feels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense inner-city films like "" boyz'n'hood "" ( 1991 ) and "" menace ii society "" ( 1993 )  
 "" bulworth's "" chief liability is beatty's insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap as his new communication device  
instead of speaking at political rallies , he breaks into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hip-hop stars are black  
it's hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad , or whether he's actually that incompetent  
at any rate , the rap sounds more run d  m  c  
than snoop doggy dogg , which makes the film seem dated instead of contemporary  
beatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the inner-city lingo and working that into his speeches , instead of trying to sound like l  l  cool j  
other than that , "" bulworth "" hits all its targets with wry , hilarious accuracy  
the film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party , and even if you don't agree with beatty's liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal government , it is hard to deny the impact the film has in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics  
unlike "" primary colors "" which opened earlier this year , "" bulworth "" doesn't try to tip-toe around the truly painful issues that hit close to home - instead , it takes them dead-on "

1,"the booming introduction music finishes , and the camera sweeps over red mountains  
we see two figures looking over a barren , and very red landscape  
they kiss , then walk on  
one of the characters ( schwarzenegger ) slips , and falls  
the glass on his mask cracks  
his face scruches up , and his eye's begin to pop      
then doug quaid , played by schwarzenegger , wakes up  
it's all been a dream  
he wakes up next to his beautiful wife , played by stone , and the film begins    
total recall is a typical sci-fi film wrapped around an intresting ( if far fetched ) plot  
quaid , who has never been to mars , keeps on having dreams of the planet , which has now been colanised  
one day , while riding on a train , he's see's a ad for a company called 'rekall' , which implants memories of a holiday , instead of you actually going there yourself  
quaid chooses the 'secret agent on mars' memory , and then the s * * * really hits the fan  
the implant goes wrong , and quaid really thinks he is an agent on mars for about two minutes , until he goes back to normal and can't remember a thing  
however , everyone he knows ( his workmates , his wife ) turn against him , saying how 'blabbed about mars' and 'blew his cover on the mission' a strange man , called richter , played by ironside , wants to kill him  
quaid , now hopelessly confused , follows the advice given to him , by a 'friend'  
he get's his ass to mars  
mars is ruled by cohagen , played by cox , who charges people for air  
against him are the rebels , who are mainly mutants  
the rebel's need quaid to defeat cohagen , because quaid knows ( but can't remember yet ) about a reactor that produces air  
eventually , quaid kills cohagen , turns on the reactor , saves the planet , and goes away with a beautiful girl , just like the guy at rekall promised him  
throughout this plot , there is huge explosions , thousands of deaths ( and i mean a lot of death ) swearing , sex , and everything else that make's a good verhoeven ( director of basic instinct and starship troopers ) movie  
naturally , there's some pretty imaginative deaths , with arms getting ripped off , someone getting drilled , and heads exploding  
as you can tell , it's violent stuff  
but it's done so stylishly , and of course arnie tones it down with a one liner , that's it excusable  
the acting is variable  
arnie , of course , is useless , but he goes has some good lines , and in the first twenty minutes , he even act's like a normal bloke , not like some action hero  
stone , of course , is useless , making a pretty poor wife , and a pretty poor action hero  
but , she does sex scenes alright  
ticoton ( most recently seen in con air ) , again , is ok , doing some good action , but getting her emotions all wrong  
one minute she hates quaid , the next she loves him , and she never gets this tranisition right  
so , the good guys are awful  
but , the bad guy's are excellent  
cox is basically reprising robocop , but he's still great in this , and he delivers the best line in the whole film near the end  
ironside is superbly evil , with an utterly emotionless face  
the supporting cast are fine , and not even the comedy sidekick ( this time in the form of a taxi driver ) is annoying  
one disappointing aspect , though , are the special effects "

produced by bruce cohen & dan jinks written by alan ball directed by sam mendes 
 "" both my wife and daughter think i'm this gigantic loser  
and they're right  
i have lost something  
i didn't always feel this sedated  "" 
with that piece of dialogue , we are fully introduced to lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) , a 42 year old man trapped within his own life  
lester works for an advertising agency  
his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid-life crisis he is suffering  
estranged from both his wife and his daughter , lester starts to crack under the stress  
his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies , and sullen apathy  
carolyn burnham ( annette bening ) , is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker  
she carefully tends her rose garden , decorates her home with the best furnishings  
but inside she is desperate  
unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent , she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family  
the third member of this anti-family is jane burnham ( thora birch ) , lester and carolyn's daughter  
a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence , but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction  
this funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple  
not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her  
some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters  
most notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney ) , the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts  
she has almost no dialogue , and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one  
colonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man  
his rage directed almost singularly at his son , ricky ( wes bentley ) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham's  
in fact they are the next door neighbors  
anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in "" american beauty ""  
alan ball , who was the co-executive producer of the hit tv series "" cybil "" and creator of the new sitcom "" oh grow up "" , has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years  
not one character in this film rings falsely  
and the depth of personality in each , is achingly honest and insightful  
the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as "" the graduate "" or "" lolita ""  
kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances  
his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age  
finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become , lester tries to return to his youth  
he quits his job ( actually blackmailing his employer for one year's salary ) , starts smoking pot , fantasizes about his daughter's girlfriend angela ( mena suvari , in a marvelous performance here ) , starts working out , and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet  
mr  spacey's performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous , that we can be certain that come oscar ? time , we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees  
annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career  
carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy  
unable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder  
ms  bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone "

1,"in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance  
ever since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80's  
in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world  
you'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open  
in wonder boys his performance isn't showy or a tour de force , it's simple yet truthful  
he embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes  
grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map  
when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms  
grady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy  
their target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for  
leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions  
he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges  
he's portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated  
he reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog )  
whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white  
leer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth  
tobey maguire fits well in the role  
with his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude  
but unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he's a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility  
katie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady's pants  
this is a plot line i had trouble with  
douglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions  
at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it's because i'm jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas's real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones  
seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping  
suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i'm pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas  
there is a movie in there somewhere  
grady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor  
okay , maybe not so chivalrous  
there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , "" she was a junkie for the printed word  
lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice ""  
robert downy j  r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm  
downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual  
he's arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance  
the actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor  
i wish wonder boys had more of him  
searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that's part of its charm  
and maybe i'm a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i'm greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema  
everyone has a sub-genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to  
i'm privy to films about literary types i  e  
those individuals enthralled by the written word , and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch  
the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points "
1,
1,"i rented this movie with very high hopes  
this movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 , and unfortunately , was not as good as i hoped , but was still very intriguing and thought provoking  
first of all , the casting for this film is great  
tobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood  
they play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly  
with a plot as unbelievable as this film , you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast  
tobey and reese ( bud and mary sue parker ) play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability  
william h  macy , an actor i have grown to love over the past year , turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife , a "" colored "" person and his friends , the "" non-colored "" ones  
he also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife  
he does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood  
joan allen is equally great as betty parker , the ideal tv mom  
her character is the most ambitious  
she is very na ? ve , and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that  
her lack of chemistry with macy , which the role calls for , and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific , and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast , then this film would even been even better  
as said before , jeff daniels gives a bad performance  
his character displays the change going on throughout the town , yet he does not display it with enough conviction  
his character is very confusing and he is not very believable  
this film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance  
the movie is very provocative  
it challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today  
i really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up , but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing  
they demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch , but do it in a slow pace  
the only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length  
some films are not meant to be that long  
pleasantville is one of those films  
this film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it  
first , they are amazed by the implementation of color  
then they want to have it  
then they do not want to  
then the war ensues between the colored and non-colored  
this is all strung out over two hours , which was way too long  
some movies need a lot of time  
saving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time  
this film is only two hours long , and seems much longer  
length is everything in films  
if you can nail down the perfect timing and pace , you can win half the battle  
pleasantville can move at a good pace at times , but it is not consistent enough  
overall , pleasantville is a very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days  
i went in expecting a light-hearted film about change  
i left learning an important lesson about racism and the way things change  
luckily , pleasantville teaches this lesson in such a way to make it appeal to all audiences  
only if it could have done in a shorter amount of time "

1,"in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers  
full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture  
go see it ! 
so , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on "" hard copy "" with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980's  
 "" hard copy "" 's diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman's fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for  
smart replied that she thought kidman's character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal  
 ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband  ) 
smart's got a point  
it wouldn't be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version  
however , given a choice between the mass media 'happening' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later  
real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman  
to die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb  
the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being 'on tv  ' 
of course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon  
but , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily  
kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne  
i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture  
her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates  
kidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell  
she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way  
at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law  
 "" you know , "" she knowingly exclaims , "" gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head  "" 
her husband beams at suzanne's profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters  
this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks  
the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix  
he plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne's sexual favors  
kidman's character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland  
phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course )  
his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain't going anywhere , ever  
phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him  
gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate  
he keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along  
van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn't stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions  
van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to 'get it' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story  
the screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i've heard since heathers  
henry's story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters  
henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic  
danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands  
either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick-or-treat parties  
all-in-all , a wonderful production , well worth your seven bucks ! 
to die for : a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant  
written by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman , matt dillon , joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard  
rated r - for language and mature themes

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
james toback's return to directing after a eight-year layoff , two girls and a guy , is a film which is comprised , more or less , of just that : one guy , blake ( robert downey jr  ) ; two girls , carla ( heather graham ) and lou ( natasha gregson wagner ) ; one primary setting ( blake's absurdly spacious bachelor apartment ) , and a great deal of dialogue  
embracing a near real-time approach , this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr  toback for his bantering characters  
fortunately , the film's cast is up to the challenge , and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters , while admittedly variable , are occasionally wickedly amusing  
the film's setup is fairly generic in nature , and opens rather unpromisingly  
we meet self-possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou , both waiting outside a soho loft  
as they engage in idle chatter , it is revealed that they're both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport , and it doesn't take long for them to come to the realisation that they're being two-timed by the same guy  
more indignant with him than catty with each other , the duo break into blake's loft and await his arrival for a confrontation  
it's when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride  
played with magnificent bombast by mr  downey jr  , blake is a cad , all right , but a captivatingly dynamic , blusterous , and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights  
it's fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat , and perhaps the film's best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return , allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others , but by his own innate behaviour  
whether he's flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi , or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds ( carla , lou , and his unseen sickly mother ) , it's never less than wildly entertaining and insightful  
though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one-man show -- a typical afternoon in the life of blake , if you will -- carla , and then lou , reveal themselves , and the sparks begin to fly  
 ( one of the great touches in the film is how blake , when startled by carla's unannounced appearance , begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat's out of the bag  ) 
double-teamed by the understandably aggrieved women ( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful -- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy ) , an increasingly-flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self-righteous declarations against their verbal jabs  
surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters , two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off-limits for this film  
however , it'd be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou's outrage to full feature-length , and it's as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel  
the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever , the film's tempo loses its liveliness , the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion , and several sequences fall flat  
subtle and not-quite-subtle allusions are made ( a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall ) , and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale  
one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla  
two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter , long-running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene -- contractually-obligated to deliver an r-rated film , mr  toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled-down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc-17 rating in favour of an r -- and while admittedly titillating , the net effect of the vignette on the film's thematic narrative is rather dubious  
if anything , two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr  downey jr  , whose versatility is put to the test in this film  
he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled , from self-assured to disconcerted , yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered  
it's a wonderful performance in a role custom-tailored for him ; mr  toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr  downey jr  was arrested on drug charges , and it's hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character -- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection , blake's self-chiding to "" get [his] shit together "" is disquieting in its resonance  
while mr  downey jr  's showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film , both actresses are solid in more broadly-observed roles  
ms  graham is quickly becoming one of america's more daring actresses , involving herself in three successive risky projects -- two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank , while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman  
she's quite appealing here , playing a character at once both dainty and sultry  
meanwhile , ms  gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying , or , like me , endearing "
1,"what a great film  
what a stunning , touching , heart-wrenching , heart-warming , life-affirming , miraculous film  
>from its opening moments , _life is beautiful_ walks that fine line between serious tragedy and uplifting comedy  
a car with no brakes speeds through the town , and guido ( roberto benigni ) motions people to move out of the way  
they mistake him to be the fascist president , traveling to their town that day  
heil ! 
heil ! 
huh ? 
shortly thereafter , the president drives through , and people stare , with blank faces  
this is standard , but somehow fresh and postmodern stuff : the clown who is also a jew , triumphs over the anti-semitic society in which he = lives  
granted , _the great dictator_ comes to mind--charlie chaplin+s almost masterpiece  
i think lib ( which benigni wrote and directed ) trumps gd in one essential point : chaplin+s jewish barber gives a great speech at the climax , but to do so , he had to break completely from character  
benigni is given a similar situation : he is mistaken as a fascist dignitary , and must explain to a classroom filled with schoolchildren = on how scientists have concluded that aryans are the superior race  
benigni+s guido stays in character , and delivers the speech , keeping = the subject matter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept  
it = is one of the great satirical scenes in modern cinema  
there are many other scenes , especially in the first half , which are bright and loopy and funny and silly  
slapstick reigns , and although the film is subtitled , there was no doubt that a universal language was being conveyed  
and although it+s focus is on the courtship of guido = to dora ( played by nicoletta braschi , benigni+s real life wife ) , a silent undercurrent creeps in  
this is clearly a racist society , evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others , and it will soon affect him and = his family  
the second half of the film takes place five years later , in an unnamed concentration camp , where guido , dora ( by her insistence ) , and their five-year old son , giosu=e9 ( giorgio cantarini ) , are deported  
guido , seeing the horrors , is desperate to protect his wife and child  
for = his wife , who is separated from him , he must find ways to communicate to = her that he is all right  
for his son , ( and this is the most controversial part of the film ) he convinces the youngster that this is all one big elaborate game : it+s rules include hiding , being very quiet , and learning to not ask for seconds  
which raises the big questions : how do we deal with pain ? 
with persecution ? 
with injustice on the worst level ? 
it+s said that tragedies bring out the best in people , finding strengths they did not realize they had  
other times they deteriorate , become overwhelmed = with little strength or incentive to swim  
sometimes even , people giggle in these moments , as if there were a vacant emotion behind them , yearning for some brightness to soothe their wounds  
benigni+s guido realizes this  
he is the clown , but he is not a fool  
he sees the slurs and the vandalism , and while feeling the weight of = the verbal attacks , he still has the audacity to see if everyone around = him , perhaps even the antagonists , laugh  
his liberty is stripped , but not his dignity , and certainly not the dignities of those around him  
it+s obvious from the onset that here is someone who is very much against fascism and the preposterousness of an aryan nation , but does so with a grinning , joyful demeanor  
perhaps that is a form of denial  
perhaps his alternate reality is all that he could muster ( not unlike the very different _brazil_ )  
or    
perhaps this is an example of great fortitude , with no weapons but = wit  
whatever his purposes is subject to debate , but also a sure sign that this is one of the great three-dimensional characters , stranded amidst = a terrifyingly risky concept  
surprisingly , it works  
it is an important footnote that this film was not intended to be an accurate reflection of the holocaust  
it+s not that the atrocities are trivialized , far from it  
they don+t have to be broadcast and explicitly shown to muster the same horror--less is more  
i believe = that benigni was cautious to preserve the tone , and i like the theory that = it is guido+s alternate reality that we+re seeing  
however , any criticism that this is rewriting history , that the holocaust wasn+t as bad as it seems , is simply off-target  
benigni+s film has won audience awards at cannes , at toronto , and is a definite shoo-in for best foreign language film ( hopefully for best picture as well )  
he has been made an honorary jew by a jerusalem film society "

1,"the year is 1962 and the military is conducting nuclear testings  
involved in these tests is hank marshall ( jones ) , an army colonel who is critical of the above-ground tests that are being done  
he urges below-ground tests which no one will consider at the time until it is learned that the soviets have conducted underground tests of their own  
marshall is also troubled by a turbulent marriage to carly ( lange ) who is topless on the base's beach in full view of the entire personnel  
hank's reaction is one of amusement  
he's been here before and he deals with it in the only way he knows how  
the problem is carly is a manic-depressive and when she isn't flirting with any man who happens to be near her , she's fantasizing about a fictious world where she'd rather be  
typical of the mental illness , she also is promiscuous and foul-tempered  
the mood swings are quick and violent and the torment she puts her husband and their two daughters is considerable  
from hank's reports which state his opposition to the army's methods of testing , he is transferred from hawaii to alabama  
carly patterns herself after movie stars and tries to become marilyn monroe , bleach-blond and all  
the new home in alabama is pretty run-down and depressing and sets carly off on a violent tantrum  
after meeting his new commanding officer ( booth ) , hank sees an all too familiar pattern begin to repeat  
carly openly flirts with the co  hank tries to deal with the situation , but his only resort is to carry her off and throw her into a nearby pool  
arguments ensue  
the family becomes even more alienated  
the co is very interested in pursuing an encounter with carly and sends hank off to observe an underground test which causes the irradiation of two local ranchers , much to the vocal objections of hank , who spots them but is unable to cancel the detonation of the bomb  
back at home , the two girls try to hold things together but they wonder why their father can't deal with their mother's problems  
one daughter says , "" he's blind and she's crazy  "" 
the other answers , "" they're perfect for each other  "" 
it reaches the breaking point when the older girl ( locane ) and a boy , the co's son ( o'donnell ) see her mother and the co making love in an abandoned shed  
she forces her mother to tell hank and get it all out into the open  
hank returns home and finds his wife in the middle of a musical put on by the military wives , including the co's wife ( snodgress )  
he confronts the c  o  
but not about carly  
he is upset over the coverup surrounding the accident during the testing  
a fight breaks out between the two when the co accuses hank of not being able to satisfy his wife  
hank is arrested  
what follows is manipulation and revenge on the part of the co  he convinces carly to commit hank to a hospital for observation  
instead , they fill him with so many drugs that he can barely cope  
he foams at the mouth and cannot even finish sewing a leather wallet as presents for his daughters  
carly is determined to free her husband from the clutches of the army and succeeds in doing so only by being the strong one in the family for the first time  
the film has an upbeat ending with hope that the family has found a way to deal with its problems  
the performances are solid throughout  
jones is sympathetic and loving and is most effective in those quiet moments when he tries to deal with his wife's rage  
he comforts her and offers protection  
lange gives a strong and spirited portrayal of a woman on the edge who draws up the courage to try and put things right for her family  
amy locane is very good as she fights to keep her family together while struggling with her own doubts as to whether she even should  
blue sky is based on the story of the stagner family  
the screenplay was written by rama laurie stagner ( with arlene sarner and jerry leichtling ) "
1,"after a rather disappointing "" mary railly "" , stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise  
this is one of the best surprises of this season -- a sweet , small budget comedy with a big heart  
in fact it's not even a comedy  
it's a drama or even more precise -- a clever satire on human relationships and needs  
based on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby , ``high fidelity'' is a wry and likable story about a man's quest for fulfillment and happiness  
rob gordon was a dj  
it seems that he could make everything spin -- except his own life  
now he owns championship vinyl , a little musical store , somewhere in new york  
when he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend , a gorgeous blond attorney , life suddenly looses every purpose  
decimated , humiliated and on the verge of a mental ( and emotional ) breakdown , he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been -- about what's right and what's important  
he starts "" categorizing "" life , dividing it into "" top 5 lists ""  
and the most important is the "" top 5 list "" over the most painful breakups of his life , starting with 5th grade , when he found his young girlfriend with another boy  
though you might think that people change , grow more mature with age , it just doesn't seem that way and all rob's relationships were different versions of that first  
where did he go wrong ? 
was it he that screwed up ? 
or maybe life just stinks ? 
while he is lost in his own self-pity , he must think of the "" top 5 list "" over his needs for the future , find the right elements and mix his life together  
with clever parallels to the cult of celebrity , music and with incredibly direct narration , it addresses the average audience member , in other words -- people like you and me  
although a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter ______ and frears , the director , the acting is equally important as the written word  
and here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned  
he is simply superb  
it is as much his movie as it is frears'  
the film would not be the same without him  
cusack -- whose character is sadder , wiser and 35 -- brings intelligence and warmth to post- mod irony  
most of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera -- not an easy task -- but cusack pulls it off  
his interpretation feels so emotionally right , so incredibly realistic and precise that frears' message simply can't be ignored or overseen  
the other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job  
both ______ and jack black are fabulous  
even catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts , not just looks beautiful  
however , the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as rob's co-worker and friend dick  
this is such an impressive achievement that it's almost worth a oscar-nomination  
he is simply a joy to behold  
otherwise , everyone are in their place , and at the right time -- all part of frears' colorful blend  
pretty much like edward norton's "" keeping the faith "" , this film doesn't follow any formula or belong to any genre -- it's dramatic , tragic , sarcastic , comic and even cynical , but never bitter or angry  
it's a little bit of everything , pretty much like life itself  
nothing seems unreal or staged  
it reflects reality as a mirror  
as you watch it , you go through the same emotional problems as the main character  
you feel and think and reflect  
this effect has become a rarity nowadays  
although it's primarily about the perils of love , ``high fidelity'' is secondarily about pop music  
rob owns championship vinyl and his employees , timid dick ( todd louiso ) and overbearing barry ( jack black ) , are fellow music snobs  
music is the language in their lives , the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives  
and so does the movie  
it is as much a musical film as anything else , as rob's journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments  
in the end , you have gained something while watching it "

1,"plot : a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side  
but this new guy is not like all the others , he's got ambition , he's got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster  
violence , lots of swearing and betrayals ensue  
critique : a very good , serious-minded , unique british gangster flick which misses the "" great "" mark by way of an annoying voice-over popping up throughout the film and a so-so ending  
here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix  
okay , so it's not entirely new , but it's definitely original when all put together as done here  
the thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place  
it's 1968 and these dudes are looking good ! 
yes , it's all about the suits , fellas    the 
italian shoes , the cufflinks , the ties and the birds ( that's ladies , for those uninitiated ) hanging around you  
here are a bunch of horrible men , gangsters if you will , looking sharp , talking shit and busting heads all over the place  
but that's not the basis of this movie  
the basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group , the excellent david thewlis , and one of his cronies , paul bettany , also extremely good in this film , and how the power , sex appeal and coolness of one , affects the other  
you know how there are always these "" hanger-on "" gangster types who latch on to the godfathers , the leaders , the top dogs of every crime organization ? 
well , most of the time , these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person    that 
is , their boss  
so all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence  
but this film brings the betrayals , the messed up loyalties , the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package  
of course , director paul mcguigan isn't trying to be guy ritchie here , and doesn't over-stylize his presentation , jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix  
nope , he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this  
the first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he's attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty ! 
 ( "" look into my eyes ! "" ) 
in fact , the last time that i've seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers' miller's crossing  
scary shite  
but there's an ever better scene than that in this film  
this one features bettany , once again , slowly torturing , hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster ( from that man's point-of-view ) , but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes , one by one ( that's right , he "" does "" the guy in his underwear )  
that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film , especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss ( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman ? )  
but the flick's not perfect  
in fact , i didn't mind malcolm mcdowell's voice-over narration at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) , he came in every now and then , and rarely added anything of interest to the plot  
all he seemed to do was swear and call people the c-word umpteen times , and even described one scene as it was happening ( ""    so 
i opened the door , then went up the lift , etc     "" -it's 
like , yeah , i know that already , i could see it on the screen ! ! 
overdone  )  
i also didn't quite "" buy "" the ending of the movie , which despite being original , seemed a little unbelievable , especially when you consider that it's supposed to be taking place 30 years later , and folks still seem to be holding grudges , still in love , still living in the same apartments ? ? ! ? 
i mean , c'mon    it's 30 years , man ! ! 
i don't know , somehow it didn't work all that well for me  
but one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies , and this one is a decent addition to the lot "

1,"this movie was one of the first american films done by director paul verhoeven  
he has done films since then such as basic instict and starship troopers  
all of his movies have one main thing in common- they don't skimp on the violence  
in a verhoeven movie a guy doesn't get shot once in the chest- he gets shot many times all over the body  
robocop takes place in detroit in the future  
things are pretty bleak  
the company ocp rules the city with an iron fist and is moving in on running the police force  
peter weller plays a cop who goes on a mission with his partner , nancy allen  
peter weller goes in an empty room alone and gets killed  
meanwhile ocp has a failed demonstration of a ed-209 model robot crime fighter  
someone comes up with the idea of having a cyborg robocop so they use any parts worth scalvaging from peter weller and make him into the robocop the movie is titled after  
the plot of this movie generally runs at a decent pace  
it drags a bit towards the end with robocop wanting to finish everybody off , but plot twists keep it exciting  
the acting is bad from weller when he is human , but very good when he is robocop  
nancy allen does a decent job  
this movie doesn't leave itself open for a sequel exactly  
but they made one anyway  
enter    
robocop 2 starring : peter weller and nancy allen directed by : irvin kershner 
detroit is in a more bleak state than it was in the first film  
ocp is trying to develop an improved 'robocop 2' that will be more than a match for criminals  
most of the police force is on strike due to ocp taking it over , leaving robocop to be the police force in the city  
this film is pretty bizaare  
it has a 13 year-old drug-lord who curses as much as eddie murphy , even more violence than the original , and some more humor  
the plot of this movie is pretty large , almost too much so  
there are three or four plot lines weaving around that don't really match up  
the effects are still decent though  
this sequel isn't more of the same really , just a darker version robocop dealing more with drugs than with armed criminals  
if you liked the first one , watch this  
but be dissapointed  
so later comes    
robocop 3 starring nancy allen and robert john burke 
ocp is now owned by a large japanese company  
robocop joins a band of rebels to counter-attack the evil empire , i mean ocp  
the japanese send a cyborg-ninja to deal with robocop  
among other things    
this movie is easier to follow than the last one  
which means the plot isn't quite as crowded  
this movie isn't anything special though "

1,"finding the courage to face life full-on is a difficult task  
summoning up the audacity to fall in love is a harder job  
if you're a total jerk like melvin udall is , the odds are even more against you  
melvin ( jack nicholson ) is a successful romance author who is just the opposite of what you would expect someone in that profession to be  
a solitary man hidden away in his new york apartment with no human interaction and not even a hint of ever having been in a passionate relationship , he avoids the outside world as much as possible  
his obsessive-compulsive disorder rules his life as he uses several different bars of soap to wash his hands and refuses to step on a crack on the sidewalk  
 ( there's a great scene when he has to cross a floor made of mosaic tiles -- _very_small_ mosaic tiles  ) 
melvin has some great lines  
when his publisher's receptionist asks him how he writes women so well in his books , he responds "" i think of men and i take away reason and accountability  "" 
don't get him wrong , he's not merely a misogynist  
setting his sights higher than that , he's also a homophobe , racist , anti-semite , xenophobe , animal-hater and intensely dislikes people who talk in metaphors  
when we first meet him , he's busy dumping a neighbor's dog down the garbage chute  
he's an equal opportunity bigot  
he does venture outside his apartment every day to eat breakfast at a local cafe  
melvin is such a grouchy curmudgeon that waitress carol connelly ( helen hunt ) is the only one willing to wait on him  
and she's none too happy about it  
when carol doesn't show up for work , melvin's routine is shot and he's determined to do something about it  
tracking down her address , he shows up at her place begging her to come back to work so that he can eat breakfast  
the fact that she's a poor single mother caring for a chronically ill son doesn't appear to phase him , he wants his food  
much more upsetting is that his gay artist neighbor simon bishop ( greg kinnear ) is brutally attacked during a robbery  
this doesn't upset melvin much ( "" don't worry , you'll be back on your knees in no time "" ) but when he is bullied into taking care of simon's dog , his life is turned topsy-turvey  
melvin is sequestered because he's afraid of what's out there on the other side of his apartment door  
he has to make sure it's ritualistically locked three times to keep the world on its proper side  
when he brings the dog home he reluctantly grows fond of it , talking to it and taking it everywhere he goes  
this little crack in his emotional armor opens him up  
hiding behind his need for carol to return to work so she can serve him , he pays for a specialist to treat her son  
he even develops a friendship with simon  
all three people are heavily damaged  
melvin has retreated from life in his apartment  
carol has devoted herself to her son , convinced that she has to give up her life for him  
simon is estranged from his parents and his friends disappear when he is hospitalized and his money runs out  
a more unlikely trio to form relationships , you'd rarely see  
and in the midst of it all , there are some wonderful moments  
melvin is hilarious in his grouchiness and touching as he attempts to be nice  
 "" you make me want to be a better man , "" he tells her  
one of the best aspects is that even as he opens up , he is still a curmudgeon  
carol , afraid that his monetary contribution to the wellness of her son hides a hidden agenda rushes over to his apartment in the rain to explain in no uncertain terms that she will never sleep with him  
it only takes her a second to realize that she is delivering that statement while looking as if she just left a wet t-shirt contest  
there's hardly anything left to say about jack nicholson  
i don't remember ever seeing him in anything less than a stellar performance and his over-the-edge melvin is no disappointment  
nicholson may be the best actor working today  
hunt does a commendable job matching nicholson's energy  
she isn't afraid to be seen as something less than a babe and her portrayal of exhausted run-down carol struggling with seemingly overwhelming obligations is top-notch "

1,"the verdict : spine-chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king , featuring an outstanding , oscar-winning performance from kathy bates  
geez , french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this ! 
sorry , non-british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders - my apologies  
the pair are british comediennes ( jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in "" absolutely fabulous "" ) , who did a series of film spoofs a few years back , including alien , the exorcist and misery  
needless to say , amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates ( the resemblance was quite uncanny ! ) , dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder's legs ! 
but despite the lingering memory of their sketch , and although i've now seen the film a couple of times now , that "" hobbling "" scene was no less disturbing ! 
i'm still left screaming at the telly in revulsion ! 
that may be the most memorable scene , but it's certainly not the only worth watching  
stephen king , whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality , strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale  
it's a nicely crafted psychological horror , which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon ( james caan )  
rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes ( bates ) , who introduces herself as the writer's "" number one fan "" , he soon becomes her prisoner  
both the script and kathy bates' beautifully masterful performance ( for which she won an oscar ) work arm-in-arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit-cake ( or is that fruity as a nut-cake ? )  
bates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece  
at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she's a rather tragic character , and more often than not she's just damned scary ! 
this is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity  
it's an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it's basically a two-hander , mainly set in one locale , it's a remarkable piece of cinema  
there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner's stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan  
oh , i haven't really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who's a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books )  
but , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show  
along with the pig , of course ! 
anyway , the tension is built-up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense  
there's the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve-shattering lengths to poison her wine  
he succeeds , but    she 
knocks the glass over ! 
i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well ! 
in the immortal words of homer j  simpson - "" d'oh ! ! "" 
other nerve-wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house  
we cut to annie in her car - she's on her way home    he 
realises this and tries to get back to his room    cut 
to the car again , she's getting near    will he make it ? 
ok , so these sequences aren't exactly original , nor perhaps unpredictable - but they work ! 
boy , do they work ! 
if a film has you on the edge of your couch , biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense , then it's doing something right ! 
of course , the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned "" hobbling "" ! 
annie realises her captive has been out of his room , and she's going to stop him once and for all  
cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer , and    i feel ill just thinking about it ! 
nasty  
it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand , and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho ! 
and then we're given one of the most ridiculously over-the-top fight scenes i've ever seen  
she gets hit over the head with a typewriter , set on fire , head smashed against the wall - and she just won't die ! 
sheldon isn't in terribly good shape either  
if it weren't so gorey it would almost be laughable  
but it's a terrifically effective film , and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked  
misery is a tight , tense , intense and chillingly entertaining thriller  
the directing is first-rate , and the performances - bates in particular - contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem  
wonderful stuff

1,"probably the most popular and praised film of all time , turned out to be a primitive and predictable costume drama with a dose of social criticism  
everyone knows about the greatest and most famous shipping disaster of all time  
and the actual catastrophe is masterfully crafted by director james cameron , combining visual -and sound effects , he re-creates the frightening atmosphere of the sinking ship in the middle of nowhere  
i liked very much the emotional and brutal contrast between the first and the third classes  
while their cabin is slowly filling up with water , a mother is telling her children a fairytail -- ""   and 
they lived happily ever after   ""  
and then the ship goes down and the few survivors are left alone under the stars and the chilling air  
however , the actual disaster is happening almost at the end of the movie , while the first two hours are just beautiful sets and bad dialogues  
in the present day , the rms titanic is explored by brock lovett ( bill paxton ) , a treasure seeker looking for the coeur de la mer diamond , lost during the sinking  
somewhere inside the ship , lovett's crew discover a sketchbook of an artist long dead  
here , in the shape of a nude young lady , is a window into the distant age of 1912  
lovett is extremely surprised when he get's a phone call from rose dawson , claiming that she is a model  
she is immediately helicoptered onto the vessel , and she gets the first glimpse of the fated ship in 80 years  
as the memories come flooding back , she once again becomes rose dewitt buketer ( kate winslet ) , the fianc ? e of wealthy cal hockley ( billy zane ) and daughter of ruth dewitt bukater ( frances fisher )  
on board there are rich and poor , everyone trust in the ship's designer ( jonathan hyde ) and her master , captain e  j  
smith ( bernard hill )  
on board the ship , rose , unhappy and restless meets jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) - a young american artist , poor , brave and attractive  
a love story slowly emerges and the two lovers must not only experience the difference between the social classes , but also face the greatest power on earth - death  
cameron could as well have called his picture "" the never ending love "" or "" love at first sight "" , as he concentrates all his energy on the young couple , and not on the disaster itself  
the plot is anything but original and the dialogues sometimes resemble a television soap-opera  
the director doesn't even try to overcome his empty script  
because of its primitive and predictable plot , titanic is totally depending on the visuals that truly are breathtaking  
russel carpenter's rich , majestic and incredibly detailed cinematography is certainly award-worthy  
everything from art direction to visual and sound effects are a top notch  
but it doesn't help much when the costumes are more convincing than the actors who wear them  
the actors are not to blame , because their characters are more like caricatures , in other words - fake  
jack is a man with many talents : he is a talented artist , handsome , brave , honest , strong , funny    you 
name it  
he doesn't have any dark side , he doesn't make any mistakes , that for a second would make him human  
jack is perfect , but he is - poor  
on the other hand we have cal  
he is a bastard that treats rose as an odalisque and not as his wife-to-be  
he lacks everything jack possesses , but he is -- rich  
this childish contrast between the social classes is one of those things that makes titanic nothing more than a mediocre picture  
cameron knows precisely what we want to see  
his film therefore contains certain minimums to draw an audience - attractive actors , a "" tragic love story "" , beautiful visuals ( including expensive special effects ) , a dose of social criticism , a fascinating historical event ( we love true stories ) and last , but not least - an incredible media support , which proclaimed an average picture the "" greatest film of all time ""  
on the outside titanic looks perfect , but behind that sparkling curtain of incredible visuals - is emptiness - nothing to think about "
1,"there's good news and bad news about mulan  
the positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy-handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules  
on the other hand , the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs , several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast  
but mulan is a step in the right direction and disney's best animated feature since the lion king  
after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas , disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians  
mulan is set in feudal china and features the ever-popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married  
that's what we find out when young mulan ( voice of ming- na wen ) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her  
cartoons    
meanwhile , word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns  
since mulan's a girl , that means her decrepit old father must go  
she pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad , but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family  
that's chinese culture for you    
so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father's uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place  
the movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army  
it should have been called g  i  
chang  
mulan calls on her ancestors for help  
they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her , but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up  
voiced by eddie murphy , mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges  
murphy's performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin -- lots of wisecracks and ad-libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they're going to have  
you ain't never had a friend like mushu  
speaking of songs , mulan doesn't have too many of them , which is a plus with a story like this  
disney songs about war probably wouldn't go over too well ( "" heigh ho , heigh ho , it's off to war i go    "" ) , and the ones they do have aren't memorable  
the best of the bunch , sad to say , is "" be a man , "" the requisite basic training montage song  
yes , even in medieval china , they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle  
sung by donnie osmond ( a bad sign if ever there was one ) , "" be a man "" accompanies footage of mulan's platoon going from screw-ups to heroes  
it makes me wonder , has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that's ended badly ? 
i only wish real-life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage  
for the curious , mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl  
all she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulder-length , talk macho and slap guys on the butt , as was male custom a thousand years ago in china  
the deception fools everyone but the audience , who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12-year-old boy , at best  
but she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army , led by a big , evil-eyed attilla-looking monster  
as a villain , the head of the huns is menacing , evil and entirely forgettable  
i saw the movie yesterday and i don't remember the man's name  
otherwise , mulan is a good movie  
the animation of the characters themselves isn't as rich as it could and should be , but there are some amazing battlefield shots "

1,"titanic is , without a doubt , the best movie i've seen all year  
and believe me , i'm not an easy critic to impress : the english patient was too long , men in black was over-hyped , and several of the "" big summer releases "" were dead in the water  
thank god this film got delayed until december  
it's my christmas present  
titanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years-gone-by , and it is truly a stunning film  
while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized , never taking your eyes off the screen , nor checking your watch to see how much longer it's gonna last , despite its 3 hour plus running time  
as a friend of mine , who's a true titanic-buff , said "" if someone doesn't like this film , it's because they didn't want to  "" 
truer words are hard to come by  
of course , it doesn't hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors , james cameron , who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time  
if you wish to argue that point with me , look at his list of credits : the terminator , aliens , the abyss , terminator 2 , true lies , etc  still care to disagree ? 
not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film , he also wrote , produced , and edited it  
and to show his true faith for the project , he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs  
it's obvious he truly loves titanic  
the film opens with footage , both real and fake , of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic , where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the "" heart of the ocean "" , which , according to bill paxton's character , would be worth more than the hope diamond today  
their search turns up , dissapointly , no diamond , but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond  
this picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose , who claims to be the girl in the picture  
she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond  
almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past  
rose's narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl , engaged to a rich man named cal hockley ( billy zane ) that she didn't want to marry  
her mother is pushy and obnoxious , and cal hockley is arrogant  
they are boarding the titanic , which is sailing to america , and this is where she is to marry cal  
meanwhile , a young man named jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) and his italian friend ( danny nucci ) win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game  
they are overjoyed , and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving  
for them , this is their ticket to america , to a better life  
for rose , she is sailing to her doom  
the first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt ( kate winslet ) and jack dawson fall in love  
it's the classic wrong-side-of-the-tracks story , and does sometimes resort to a few cliches  
but as i said above , the love portion isn't sappy and doesn't "" weigh the film down "" , as some critics have said  
it's sweet , and it didn't make me restless at all , despite the fact that i usually hate love stories  
of course , it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen  
most of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912 , including the enigmatic molly brown ( played by the talented kathy bates ) , the captain of titanic ( bernard hill ) , and so on  
all of these characters add an extra depth to the film , and make it that easier to watch  
of course , things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark , where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom  
the sinking is depicted realisticly , and the effects are truly amazing  
it is not told in a heroic fashion sense either , as people are portrayed as panicking , pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats , and drowning and dying horrible deaths  
the best part of the movie , in my opinion , comes at the very end , when we flash back to the future  
the crew , who at first had been skeptical of rose's story , now are totally aborbed by her  
rose goes out onto the ship's ledge , and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard  
we then see a dream of rose's , in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson  
most people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream  
however , i think it symbolized more ; i think it meant that rose had died , and is going to a sort of heaven , which would be the happiest part of her life : her and her one true love , jack

1," "" when you get out of jail , you can kill him  "" 
starring ashley judd , tommy lee jones , bruce greenwood  
rated r  
double jeopardy is a lurid , prepostrous thriller that's also one of the year's most enjoyable  
it's an uncompromisingly brutal , cheerfully anarchic , hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it  
there is not a moment here when the events on screen don't have a direct bearing on the plot ; once the film gets going it never stops  
it has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and that's probably a correct assessment of the plot , but the film itself has little in common with the 1993 andrew davis/harrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones  
not even bothering with character introduction , director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the get-go and never finds the brake  
we meet , rather hastily , libby and nick parsons ( ashley judd and bruce greenwood , respectively ) a seemingly happy married couple , with a son matty , age 4  they go out on a sailboat one night , and after a period of some rockin' sex , they go to sleep  
libby hears a strange noise , wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood  
she follows a red trail to the upper deck , where she finds a knife and , out of astonishment , picks it up  
at that convenient moment , the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested  
her lawyer , a friend , puts up a defense in court , but though we know she is innocent , the evidence against her is too compelling  
her friend adopts her son and she goes to prison  
once in prison , she makes a phone call to her friend  
her friend gives her son the phone  
nick walks in the room  
little matty screams "" daddy ! "" 
the phone goes dead  
libby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isn't even dead  
she gets some advice from a prisoner/former lawyer , who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband , they can't convict her of the same crime again , meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they can't touch her  
after a weirdly short amount of time , she gets out of parole  
she is sent to live at a house with other recent parolees , under the command of parole officer travis lehman ( tommy lee jones )  
she sets out on a mission to find her husband and get her son back , which turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated  
she winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her son's "" adopter ""  
double jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false  
the law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime : same time , same place , same circumstances  
it's not like it matters  
this is a rollickingly good thriller ; intense , exciting , fast and furious  
it's silly alright , but this is the kind of film you just don't question  
in some films , plausibility is everything  
double jeopardy , however , is not concerned with making sense : its sole purpose is to entertain , and it does  
judd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role  
this is her breakout box-office performance , and she is terrific  
she brings some emotion to what could have been a one-dimensional role , giving the movie a little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set pieces  
tommy lee jones basically just reprises the role for which he won an oscar in the fugitive , but the movie makes good use of his stone-faced wit  
thankfully , too , double jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby and travis ; a subplot which doubtlessly would have interfered with the film's story  
this is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys , and i took a sort of sick pleasure in that  
the sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful , as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book  
after all the idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops , deft fbi agents and the virtues of the american legal system , it's great to see a movie that doesn't so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure  
double jeopardy is really good , but it isn't the kind of good that is remembered or recognized with awards  
it's one of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off , otherwise , your brain will be busy ruining your experience  
this is a thriller that isn't concerned with being smart or plausible "
1,"george little ( jonathan lipnicki ) wants a little brother  
after mr  and mrs  little ( hugh laurie and geena davis ) visit the orphange , they decide to adopt stuart , a talking mouse ( voiced by michael j  fox )  
george isn't so fond of his new brother when stuart arrives at the little house , and neither is snowbell the family cat ( voiced by nathan lane )  
george and stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race , but snowbell wants stuart out of the house ( he's unable to live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying it's ridiculous that a mouse has a pet cat )  
stuart little is a mix of live action and computer generated imagery ( cgi )  
the character of stuart , while obviously a computer generated image , grows on you as the film progresses and you'll soon see him as much more than a mere special effect  
there is also a great deal of animal training involved with this film , as many of the "" supporting cast "" are actual cats ( with computer animated mouths so they can speak )  
it's fascinating to watch these cats give performances without an actual mouse to interact with  
stuart little is a charming family film  
there are some great laughs in the movie ( with a script co-written by the sixth sense's m  night shyamalan no less ! ) , 
some moments that can only be described as "" too cute "" ( the boat race sequence is what won me over ) and even the majority of the one-liners ( common nowadays in children's films or films featuring nathan lane ) are tolerable  
kids and parents will love this one  
stuart little is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video  
there are two different dvds on sale : one contains the film in full frame , and the other presents the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1  66 : 1  
both versions feature choices of either dolby surround or dolby digital 5  1 audio  
both versions also contain the following extras ( and hang in there with me here    there's a lot of them ) : a full length audio commentary track by director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson , a full length audio commentary track by the visual effects supervisors , an isolated score track , an interactive trivia game , an interactive featurette that goes step by step through eight of the effects in the film , a making of documentary that originally aried on hbo , and a stuart little read-along story ( which you can read yourself or have stuart read for you )  
there are also three music videos , and six theatrical trailers ( called thecatrical trailers    
get it ? 
it's funny ! ) for stuart little and five other columbia tristar releases : the adventures of elmo in grouchland , madeline , the nuttiest nutcracker , muppets from space , and baby geniuses ( the only bad thing about this entire dvd    
i did not want to be reminded of the awfulness that is baby geniuses )  
dvd-rom features are also on the disc , including web links and a demo of the stuart little cd-rom game  
but wait    
there's still more ! 
there's a section called "" basement treasures "" where you will find the auditions of the film's animators , six deleted scenes which you can select to view with or without commentary from the director , a visual effects gag reel , a production gag reel , and an incredible eight minute storyboard sequence detailing the original concept for the boat race scene ( with commentary from the director )  
the first commentary track features director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson  
they give insightful and detailed thoughts about the film's production  
minkoff likes to point out scenes where other screenwriters came in and polished up the script , namely writers like scott alexander and larry karaszewski ( who wrote the people vs  larry flynt and ed wood ) and lowell ganz and babaloo mandel ( who wrote splash and multiplicity , among others )  
anderson is very appreciative of the animators who worked with him and often points out which animator worked on each scene as they occur  
the second commentary track features visual effects supervisors john dykstra and jerome chen who discuss more specific details of the effects in the film  
movie fans will enjoy the informative first commentary track , serious animation buffs will love the second one "
1," "" you'll go ape over tarzan because it's more fun than a barrel of monkeys ! "" 
okay , there's the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie  
disney's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship  
father , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson  
it's amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack  
before you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard  
against the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own  
tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild  
much of tarzan's young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his "" father , "" which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his attempts  
all he's looking for is acceptance , perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers , but one which will ring true with a lot of adults  
when you really think about it , this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end  
look back on past disney animated features and you'll see the trend  
growing up , tarzan ( voiced by alex d  linz as a child , and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends  
one is an ape named terk ( rosie o'donnell ) , and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight )  
both provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold  
i'm beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films  
just fill in the blanks ! 
can you see it ? 
 "" now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it  
we've already had a fish and a crab , and we've had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues     have 
we had an ape and an elephant yet ? 
well , there we go ! "" 
of course , there's gotta be romance somewhere along the line , so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through  
together with her father dr  porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa  
she discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately , and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory "" you tarzan , me jane "" scene  
thankfully , those aren't the exact words  
however , i found it distracting that tarzan is going "" ohh ohh ee ee "" one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction  
how does he tell his name to another ape ? 
 "" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? "" 
well , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable  
but hey , tarzan's a young adult  
do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ? 
isn't that illegal in most countries ? 
oh , well  
i don't think disney will be using my quote anymore  
tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical  
there's lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time  
we instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material  
this isn't really a bad thing , as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it's just different  
do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie  
with each new feature , disney animation gets even better  
not necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan  
there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying  
the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this isn't just tarzan , it's "" extreme tarzan  "" 
however , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its "" chandelier scene , "" which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking  
lasting but a few seconds at most , it's been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail  
as usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters "

1,"in the wake of the smashing success of "" rumble in the bronx , "" it's looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release  
rumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii  
the version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it's widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days  
availability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng  
the subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small  
although the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you're reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it  
to be fair , i must admit that i've never been very fond of "" period-piece "" martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past  
perhaps it's because most of those i've seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it's because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant  
in fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end  
or , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc  ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts  
having said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i've seen , and i quite enjoyed it  
surprised ? 
well , so was i  
drunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu  
where he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong's practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu  
apparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i've heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i'll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better  
one of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the "" once upon a time in china "" movies , but i have not yet seen those  
the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you're watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren't expecting something on the order of "" war and peace ""  
the story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china's cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill  
however , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong's perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs  
the macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners  
in the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer  
in the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng  
after fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general's son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng  
and so it goes  
and the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong's girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i've already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves  
let's move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies    the 
action  
there's plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie    of 
course , in a kung fu film , that's to be expected  
however , this isn't just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius  
the primary martial arts "" style "" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk  
further , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated    but 
there's a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor  
under normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair  
the kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i'll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching  
another thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work "

1,"warning : this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film "" fail-safe  "" 
if you haven't seen the film yet , proceed with caution  
nutshell : a relevant , intelligent , suspenseful drama  
still powerful today , even after the end of the cold war  
-------------------- "" fail-safe "" ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes 
screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e  youngstein directed by sidney lumet 
review by jamahl epsicokhan -------------------- 
the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn't have a winning side and a losing side  
in a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world--assuming the world survives  
the idea--and perhaps the only real option--is to avoid war at all costs  
this is the theme of sidney lumet's "" fail-safe , "" a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler  
 "" fail-safe "" takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism  
the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws  
five u  s  bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america  
the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers  
suddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike  
a great deal of "" fail-safe "" 's plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u  s  bombers from reaching russia's borders--at any cost  
the plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios  
the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails  
general bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable  
the events in "" fail-safe "" are fascinating because they're anything but predictable , but the real reason "" fail-safe "" works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot  
a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states' role in all of it  
most of this is through the film's use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president's advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war  
many of the film's most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices  
early in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of "" strategy "" in a nuclear assault to "" minimize "" casualties  
 "" what's the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? "" 
a guest asks impatiently  
 "" forty million , "" groeteschele responds wryly  
the problem with groeteschele's mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war  
the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals  
groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over  
yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o'herlihy ) has often recommended  
on the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u  s  , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage  
such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race  
 "" fail-safe "" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film  
why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ? 
is it wise ? 
is it even logical ? 
no , not really  
although "" fail-safe "" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way  
again , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film's most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance  
in addition to providing the central "" pro-nuclear war "" voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism  
the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib "

1,"in october of 1962 the united states found itself on the brink of nuclear holocaust when u2 spy plane fly-overs of cuba revealed that the soviet union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles 90 miles from the us  
president john kennedy ( bruce greenwood ) and his staff must face this major threat to world peace and stop soviet expansionism in director roger donaldson's dramatic recreation of the most dangerous crisis in american history in "" thirteen days  "" 
one of the highlights to come out of made-for-tv movies was a 1974 entry called "" missiles of october "" that also recreated the historic event that almost embroiled the us , ussr and the world in an all out nuclear showdown  
that teleplay , starring william devane and martin sheen as john and bobby , showed the political tensions of the period that brought to the fore the danger the world faced in those two weeks in 1962  
now , a quarter of a century after the landmark tv movie , director roger donaldson and producer kevin costner team together again ( the last time was for the taught spy thriller "" no way out "" ) to re-enact the events of that most dangerous time in america's and the world's history  
taken from the viewpoint of special assistant to the president kenneth p  o'donnell ( costner ) , donaldson and crew recreate that volatile event , once again , as the country is plunged into what could have been total nuclear war  
as o'donnell gets ready to head to work one october morning , he deals with the usual family crises and problems  
meanwhile , a u2 spy plane photo mission over cuba has produced some startling images - medium range nuclear missiles in the first stage of deployment  
suddenly , ken's routine day switches into crisis mode as the president and his key advisor bobby begin to muster the considerable forces of the us military to face the soviet threat  
where "" thirteen days "" differs most from "" missiles of october "" is , as expected , in the scope of the project  
there is a big difference , budget-wise , between making a television docudrama and one that goes to the big screen  
it shows as the makers of "" thirteen days "" craft a recreation of the cuban missile crisis that encompasses not only the political intrigue within the white house , it also depicts the events that took place as america girds itself for nuclear confrontation  
the cast , a true ensemble , is led , surprisingly , by bruce greenwood as jfk and not by kevin costner  
costner's o'donnell represents the family guy thing as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him and his family  
this puts a personal spin on the film as we see both the crisis and america's preparation for war and the pressure it brings to bear on those in the know  
kenny reassures his wife and kids that all will be okay and they will be safe , but he knows that , if the crisis comes to a head , his family will be no more  
the meat of "" thirteen days "" is in the big picture , not the microcosm of family , though  
this is where the film stands out as we see the workings of our government on the highest levels  
the story does not just cover the face-off between the world's two most powerful countries ; it also depicts the animosity between the president and the military/cia  
the disaster of the bay of pigs invasion the year before left a distrustful taste in the mouths of the generals and admirals who blame the kennedys for not backing the cuban expatriates fighting fidel castro  
the missile crisis becomes a struggle for power as the army/navy/air force want to flex their might and invade cuba , while jfk wants to end the confrontation peaceably but with america's dignity and world leadership intact  
while the internal battle for power rages in the white house , with air force chief curtis lemay ( kevin conway ) advising the president to bomb cuba into the stone age , our armed forces are set into motion to stop the soviets with a blockade of offensive weapons to cuba  
this is where the political intrigues of high office are replaced by exciting action  
when the first confrontation takes place between a us warship and a soviet freighter , the tension is palpable  
the most involving action sequence takes place late in the game as another u2 is sent up to shoot some snaps of the buildup and the fully prepared soviet forces launch an anti-aircraft attack on the hapless pilot of the spy plane  
this is a sweaty palm sequence to say the least , making you squirm in your seat as you try to help the pilot avoid those missiles  
the ensemble cast places greenwood as the first among equals with like weight given to all the principle players  
greenwood does not play act at being a caricature of jfk , foregoing the typical kennedy boston accent  
instead , he plays the man as a powerful figure who has to maintain the dignity of the office , directing his subordinates but giving them the latitude to make clear all of his options  
kennedy used this decision by committee method to good effect as his senior staff uncovers all the options available to the president  
costner , as ken o'donnell , is really a supporting cast member as a kennedy crony brought on board as a personal political favor  
costner plays o'donnell as if he crammed on old jfk speeches with a forced kennedyesque twang to his speech  
the rest of the players are first rate from start to finish with steven culp looking and sounding just like robert kennedy  
the rest of the familiar players in this drama are uniformly well cast , too  
standing out are michael fairman as the beleaguered us ambassador to the un , adlai stevenson , who was forced to become the challenging voice of the united states in the united nations and i remember the confrontation vividly  
the filmmakers capture the accusations laid down by stevenson with accuracy , using old style video footage to good effect  
dylan baker has the look and feel of the intelligentsia as the brainy secretary of defense robert mcnamara  
kevin conway gives his general lemay the right "" bomb them to hell "" attitude  
also notable is christopher lawford as navy pilot william ecker who , with his wingman , takes on the dangerous mission of a low-level photo recon into the heart of cuba , bravely challenging kenny o'donnell's admonition , "" don' get shot  "" 
tech credits are superb across the board with an admirable depiction of the us armed forces being placed on a war footing  
it's an impressive production with the careful use of period aircraft and ships that gives the film a veracity fitting the event  
solid costuming by isis mussenden is subtle but has the look of the kennedys "

1,"capsule : the director of cure brings a weird and very complex concept to the screen  
one viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse  
the idea is something about ghosts and the internet  
the film has an amazing apocalyptic style  
 , +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
perhaps the most disturbing ( and disturbed ? ) 
filmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa  
his films all seem to have one style , bleak  
the worlds he creates are terrifying and cold  
little known in the us to date , his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver  
most of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid  
his 1998 film cure , with one of his niftiest ideas , is just now getting a sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with  
cure is probably his classic  
last year he released seance , a remake of seance on a wet afternoon  
that was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into a non-supernatural story  
pulse is kurosawa back on form  
taguchi , a young computer expert , is late with his delivery of some important software  
two co-workers go to his apartment and find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment  
taguchi , acting very strangely , lets his friends look for the missing software  
meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain  
when he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself  
if that was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange dark mildew-like spot on the wall  
taguchi's computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus  
people whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide  
but they are not entirely dead  
their spirits seem to remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet  
people who get the computer virus are asked if they want to see a ghost  
if they say yes , they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow  
the computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist  
this is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing "" like a computer disk  "" 
instead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses  
there is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers  
leave it to kurosawa to find a new kind of death  
this is a film that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the film all work  
it may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to death , but whatever it does convey is nightmarish  
kurosawa , who directs his own screenplay , ties his story into the real world with some familiar and accurate computer discussion  
frequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact  
his plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange  
junichiro hayashi , the cinematographer who recently has been doing all of kurosawa's films , creates a dark , cold , and gloomy tone  
images are obscured by semi-lighting or are behind plastic curtain  
scenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might  
people are shot with guns but there is little if any blood in evidence  
seeing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary  
kurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock , but a deeper metaphysical dread  
of any horror filmmaker in the world , kiyoshi kurosawa is the one to watch "
1,"director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one )  
film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story , but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something  
but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story  
so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential , the film almost automatically deserves a good review  
and when they add a fascinating story to it , you have nearly perfect entertainment  
fincher's the game is no exception to this  
the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time  
fincher hasn't made a film since "" seven , "" his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever  
so it is about time he made another film  
and what a ride it is  
the game isn't quite as powerful as "" seven , "" but in some ways it is better  
overall , the game could have used a little more clarity , or a little more uncertainty  
it walks a line of insanity and reality , but it never goes either way until the very end  
the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events , and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight  
unfortunately , unlike "" the usual suspects , "" we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening , whether it be true or false  
however , this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent  
the game is told completely from its main character's point of view  
nicholas van orton ( michael douglas ) is a high-strung and isolated businessman  
he lives alone in his giant mansion , divorced from his wife elizabeth , and is celebrating his 48th birthday ; the same age at which his father committed suicide at , in the same mansion  
for his 48th birthday , conrad ( sean penn ) , the rebel of the family , gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs : consumer recreation services  
 "" it will make your life fun again , "" his brother promises  
as skeptical as nicholas is , he is somewhat intrigued , and annoyed by the lack of information--something this businessman hates  
seeing a billboard in an office , he decides to visit the mysterious company  
jim feingold ( james rebhorn ) greets nicholas and guides him through the sign-up process , which consists of psych-tests , physicals , emotional responses , and other mind games  
 "" each game is suited to each person's emotional and psychological needs , "" explains feingold  
one day , nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests  
even more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up , he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company  
what he doesn't realize is that the game has already begun  
the phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas' way  
how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive  
the detail involved in fincher's shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them  
with "" seven , "" fincher had almost every single shot mean something  
he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to  
compared to "" seven , "" though , the game is light and comical  
because of this film's sense of humor and self-awareness , nothing can be taken quite seriously  
so don't try to make much sense of what goes on in the game , because it doesn't want you to  
what does make sense is the final revelation--when everything becomes apparent and clear  
if taken as it is , the game's ending makes complete sense  
but if you try and critique every minute detail , then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility  
perhaps that is the reason i docked the film  
while trying to remain realistic and plausible , the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen  
we don't really care if douglas' character lives or not because it isn't believable  
the ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously , but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is , you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller "
1,"a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal  
a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another  
a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain  
a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end  
if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues  
it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label  
edward zwick's the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states  
you'd think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines  
arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u  s  responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack  
however , unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden's camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal  
in retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world  
unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau's new york office at one federal plaza  
while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information  
generally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u  s  , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm  
even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country  
hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government  
the original tagline for patriot games was , "" there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil  "" 
however true , it was pulled before the movie's release because it sounded too much like a dare  
revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america  
admittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who's going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two-thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid  
i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare of good guy g-men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order  
it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab-american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself  
in fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk  
although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups  
throughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully  
what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides  
it actually gets rather heady at times , but it's a credit to screenwriters zwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they don't underestimate the intelligence of the audience  
i don't know if it's his tone or inflection or something else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great  
this , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid-level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable  
annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i've seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable  
it's somewhat unfortunate that her character's fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range  
bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough-guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face  
however , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film's development  
notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant  
the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society  
difficult to say the least , shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch  
perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom "" wings , "" shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night  
whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick's favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) , james horner seems to be his favorite composer  
i therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score-writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian-themed music , and horner's record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish-sounding at most "

1,"roman emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) chooses his trusted general maximus ( russell crowe ) as his successor  
however the emperor's evil son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) murders his father before the announcement can be made , and maximus ( as well as his family ) is sentenced to be executed  
maximus is able to escape his executioners , but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo ( oliver reed )  
proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money ( he being a former gladiator himself ) , and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator  
when emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum , proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle  
maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus  
gladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania , and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required "" 40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence "" style of moviemaking  
the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used    
it's choppy slow-motion which is unsettling and distracting  
it's similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan , but nowhere near as effective  
the actual gladiator battles are thrilling , but also a bit disjointed  
many times it's unclear as to exactly what's going on    
all the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled  
we're not sure who's blood or by who's hand though  
there's an instance of this earlier in the film too that's disappointing  
it's comes when maximus escapes his executioners  
some flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free    
but i still don't know exactly how he did it  
russell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995's virtuosity  
for whatever reason his stardom never arrived    
but he should have it now  
from here on moviegoers should now be able to say , "" let's go see the new russell crowe movie ""  
he gets the best scene in the film ( and one of the best moments of all recent movies ) when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum  
it's both rousing and chilling  
joaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person and not just a cartoon character ( which could have easily happened )  
commodus is conniving , sneaky and whiny , but phoenix never lets the character get silly  
it's a very good ( and very creepy ) performance  
oliver reed died during the filming of gladiator , and it's a huge loss to the acting world  
i've always been fascinated with reed    
he's one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years  
it's ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again , as he gives a fun and sincere performance  
the film is dedicated to him , and he will surely be missed  
reed's death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem , as he still had scenes to be completed "
1,"i didn't realize how apt the name of this movie was until i called the mpaa ( the motion picture association of america - the folks who decide what's g , nc 17 , pg , r or x ) to ask why the preview was rated r  so that we can make some sense of their response , let me tell you about the movie itself  
 "" the celluloid closet "" is a documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades  
it's brilliant , funny , naughty and extremely poignant  
it tore at my heart to watch a gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that , as a rule , gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen  
regardless of how veiled - or how sordid - the presence of a gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation and makes them feel as if they're not quite so invisible as america seems to want them to be  
the movie itself is rated r - and for good reason  
it contains scenes of bloody , violent gay bashing and graphic , uninhibited , sex  
as with any movie , i appreciate knowing about these things ahead of time , so i can decide for myself whether to see the movie with a friend , a date , my 11 year old niece , alone or not at all  
but , that's the movie  
now back to the preview  
prior to this film being theatrically released ( it was originally filmed as a documentary for hbo ) i had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times  
there was no nudity , no violence , no bad language , nothing that i could see that would be offensive or inappropriate for a general audience ( okay , whoopi goldberg did refer to someone "" boning "" someone , but the last i knew that wasn't one of the seven words you can't say on tv )  
except for a scene of two fully clothed men kissing  
hmmmmm  
when i inquired about the rating on the trailer , a very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from "" the handbook "" that a trailer approved for all audiences could contain "" no homosexuality or lesbianism and no going down on someone  "" 
hello ? i was in the office and it was the middle of the day  
bravely , i pursued  
 "" i've seen that trailer , oh    
probably half a dozen times , "" i gulped    
 "" and i don't remember that scene  "" 
 "" well , "" she chirped  
 "" it's there  
our little eyes are trained to see that  "" 
no really  
in the words of dave barry , "" i am not making this up  "" 
they are "" trained "" to "" see that ? "" 
when someone who was shocked at the rating the first time and made a note to watch it carefully the following five times or so managed to let it slip past her ? 
gosh , i certainly don't mean to question the mpaa , or "" the handbook ""  
i would , however , like to suggest that it's they who are in the closet on this one  
and the light ain't good in there  
but , having seen "" the celluloid closet , "" and being one of a handful of straight people involved in a primarily gay and lesbian weekly bible study ( email me and i'll give you the details ) , none of this was any big surprise  
the point of the movie was that homosexuality , even in the politically correct 90s , is ridiculously perceived as a threat to a mostly heterosexual society  
a point well made in this candid and honest film  
now , i could go off on the mpaa's ruling that a trailer must contain "" no homosexuality or lesbianism "" and ask how that is defined , particularly in light of some of the things , both sexual and non-sexual , that i've watched straight people do in trailers  
i just don't feel the need to go there , because it seems so obvious  
i'll instead suggest that the mpaa re-evaluated their evaluation criteria  
let the ratings reflect not subject content , like "" sex "" and "" violence ""  
let them reflect attitude content  
in the future , i'd be interested in knowing whether the movie is rated d for disrespectful or s for stereotyped  
then i'd truly be able to make an informed decision about how i spent my time "

chris ( michael vartan ) and tim ( matthew lillard ) are two guys who really want the 4  0 to get into harvard

chris and tim are also roommates with rand , played by randall batinkoff

she wants to know more , but he will not even speak with her  
will he give in ? 
will tim turn chris in ? 
will chris turn tim in ? 
will they turn themselves in ? 
all of these questions were running through my mind while watching this slick suspense film  
the events in the curve are very surprising , original , and fun  
the plot sounds much like dead man on campus , but that is not the deal with this film  
this film is a very serious one , with not many laughs  
there are many twists and turns that make this film different from most films  
the ending in particular is completely unpredictable and satisfying  
it is a terrific , suspenseful ending that i could never predict would happen  
hands down to dan rosen who wrote this wild ride  
the sound really stood out in the film  
it is quite eerie and it really adds to the feel of the film  
the way the movie is filmed is also great  
all of the technical aspects , as well as the acting and directing aspects are very well done  
the performances in the curve are very good  
matthew lillard gets to play another creepy role , just like in 1996's scream  
 ( a+ ) he is very strange in this film as well  
i like him in this sort of role , rather than the roles he has been playing in comedies such as senseless and she's all that  
michael vartan is fantastic as chris , who has extremely mixed emotions about the entire murder and the 4  0  
michael vartan was also superb in never been kissed , where he co-starred with drew barrymore as a teacher who fell in love with his student  
keri russell also gives a great performance "
1,"i have a soft spot in my heart for pure , amoral sleaze  
i liked showgirls ( there , i said it )  
i typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz , sex-filled cinematic tabloid-ish trash  
wild things is the best sleazy film i've ever seen  
it's filled with great performances , graphic sex , three-way sex , rape charges , double-crosses , plot twists , genitalia of all genders , graphic violence , death , witty humor , and , best of all , denise richards  
criticizing this film for being disgusting , raucous , and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing , or titanic for being lofty and epic  
wild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors , but i don't just admire it for this--i admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the movies  
i must admit up-front , however , that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal  
i imagine that this shows  
it's hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn't be known  
i thought i had the whole thing worked out from the trailer , but i was wrong ; there are a lot of turns here  
i'll just say that the film takes place in blue bay , a rich little town in florida  
in blue bay lives sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students , kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , and suzie toller ( neve campbell )  
kelly's mother , sandra ( theresa russell ) , immediately presses charges  
all of this happens fairly early in the film  
and right up until this point , i had the whole film predicted  
i was wrong , though , and every time i was proven wrong , i was shocked  
wild things isn't even remotely plausible , but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless , and often invited , just for kicks  
i remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers  
i'd give the preview four stars  
it made me want to see the movie so much that i've been waiting for it anxiously ever since  
over the past few weeks though , i started to realize that there was no way the film could live up to the preview ( see independence day ) ; thankfully , i was proven wrong  
the preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution company : not only does it make us want to see the film , but it doesn't give away any of the secrets  
but i'm not here to talk about the preview  
i'm here to talk about denise richards  
now , i found her mildly interesting in starship troopers , but in wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene she's in demands attention in a way that almost no other performer can  
of course , this might have something to do with her oceanic eyes    and 
flawless body    but 
i thought she did a great job acting , too ( stop laughing )  
no , richards is truly a find--she is talented , and always convincing in this film  
this mixed in with her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace in the future  
the other actors are good , too  
dillon is as suave as ever ( it's nice to see him bouncing back from albino alligator and in & out )  
bacon does a good job acting all determined and stuff as a sex crimes officer  
neve campbell gives the most layered performance of all of them , though i won't pretend that any of these characters are deep and complex  
for a plot like this to work , all of these people have to be insane and basically contrived  
that's okay , because director john mcnaughton knows that he's making a self-consciously wicked film  
each scene--even the three-way sex scene--is observed with hilarity by mcnaughton , and the result is a sleaze-fest that's too smart to resist  
there isn't an inconsistent moment in wild things : every bit of it is alluring garbage , so trashy it's funny , and so entertaining it's painful "

1,"as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it , the more pleased i was when i left  
first , getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz : "" if you liked scream , you'll love wild things ! "" 
 "" campbell gives a stunning performance ! "" 
 "" this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days ! "" 
 ( oh yeah , the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me ) 
now , onto more serious stuff ( and with this film , i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way )  
wild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa  
i'm not saying that in a bad way , but when you see this film , you may be shocked by what you see  
however , perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film's charming cast and tricky plot , that they let the film slide with an r rating  
being mormon , i'm bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film  
trouble is , i have already seen it  
and i like it ! 
wild things is a film noir of the 90s , filled with 40s sensibilities , and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture  
the style in which it is filmed is rich in color  
the actors are all gorgeous people , seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film  
sure , it's all too good to be true , but ain't it fun to watch ? 
when movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it  
there will be people who don't want to admit liking what they see , but i tell you , most anyone who sees this will like it  
wild things begins at blue bay high school , the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into  
it's almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone )  
of course , there are those select few who may look slightly ugly , but compared to the average person , they are gorgeous  
immediately , the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time  
we can turn off our brains , right ? 
wrong  
while you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn't turn out that way  
the film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present  
there's sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students  
he's heading the class discussion  
there's also kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam  
teaching the class , however , are two policemen : ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) , who want to talk about 'sex    
 ( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) '  
 "" what is a sex crime ? "" 
ray asks  
 "" not gettin' any ! "" 
one student responds  
this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch  
however , upon hearing this , one student , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , stands up and leaves the room , commenting that they can both kiss part of her body  
and so , wild things sets into motion  
quickly , kelly begins hitting on sam , but sam doesn't want anything to do with her advances  
kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him  
she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep  
surprisingly , that's really all i can tell you about the plot  
any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists  
and what's more , these plot twists are actually unpredictable  
going along the way of scream , wild things maintains that film's surprises , and then adds even more to them  
there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen  
and even though you think you may get tired of them , the surprises are so genuine that it's rather pleasing  
going back over them in my mind , nearly all of them work , though some stretch the boundaries of belief  
thankfully , the convoluted plot doesn't give us much time to think about each one , pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off  
as for the critics who complain that the film is trashy--well , it is "
1," "" jaws "" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen  
the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds  
then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score  
dah-dum  
from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly  
right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once "" jaws "" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip  
perhaps what is most outstanding about "" jaws "" is how spielberg builds the movie  
he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act  
unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act  
until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music  
he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying  
he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery  
the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years  
the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money  
brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute  
hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( "" it's a perfect engine , an eating machine "" ) make it that much more terrifying  
when vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark  
the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it  
 "" jaws "" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror  
it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by "" star wars "" )  
even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's "" psycho , "" and it never seems to age  
although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill  
the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects  
scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time "" jaws "" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman  
nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark  
scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town  
 "" it's your first summer here , you know , "" mayor vaughn warns him  
dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in "" american graffiti "" ( 1973 ) and "" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz "" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers  
however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards  
bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism  
he's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature  
however , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars  
quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u  s  s  
indianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese  
his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen  
shaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film  
of course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature  
a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in "" jaws , "" and they are a threat  
every one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into  
the shark in "" jaws "" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed "" bruce "" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles  
many have forgotten , but "" jaws "" was a sort of precursor to "" waterworld "" ( 1995 ) , a movie's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb "

1,"when quentin tarantino made "" pulp fiction "" , he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s ; he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time  
but before you send me hate-mail for not giving that title to "" citizen kane "" , hear me out  
much like "" citizen kane "" , "" pulp fiction "" has changed movie making forever  
but i think the latter has had a tad more impact  
 "" pulp fiction "" has actually ushered in a new era of film making  
it has altered the way films will be viewed  
 "" fiction "" has spawned so many imitations , i've lost count  
sure , some have been excellent ( "" bound "" and "" the usual suspects "" spring immediately to mind ) , but any serious movie-goer recognizes "" pulp fiction "" as the original neo-noir of the 90s  
in this review , i hope to change all the people's minds who have criticized it for it's excessive profanity and violence ( which , by the way , isn't really that graphic )  
the most brilliant aspect of tarantino's masterpiece is the screenplay  
it is filled with so much classic dialogue ( the "" quarter pounder with cheese "" speech will go down in history ) , it should be required reading for any film student , if it isn't already  
the story ( told in unorthodox non-linear format ) centers around three main episodes , all of which eventually intertwine  
the first , titled "" vincent vega and marcellus wallace's wife "" , deals with a very loaded john travolta ( i forgot to mention the cool heroin shoot-up sequence ) taking mia wallace ( a star-making performance by uma thurman ) , his bosses wife , out on a date to a cool 50s restaurant called jack rabbit slim's  
they talk for a while ( with the occasional "" uncomfortable silence "" ) , mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror  
after giving marcellus' new bride a foot massage , he was thrown off a building and into a greenhouse , giving him a "" speech impediment ""  
they also partake in a cool dance contest and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic "" you never can tell ""  
i won't reveal the rest of the story , but i'll definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night , despite the cool trophy they win  
the second story ( the least of the three but still four stars ) stars bruce willis ( proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the "" die hard "" flicks ) as boxer butch coolidge  
previously in the film ( like i said , it's told in non-linear form ) , he had made a deal with marcellus wallace that he would take a fall in a match  
as it turns out , he not only doesn't take the fall , but he ends up actually killing his opponent  
he takes a cab to his half-witted girlfriend's apartment , and to make a long story short , ends up going back to his own place to retrieve a gold watch , sort of a family heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flash-back sequence  
on his way home , he bumps into ( literally ) marcellus  
the two winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers , which results in the infamous "" gimp "" scene , which is very reminicent of the "" squeal like a pig ! "" 
scene from "" deliverance ""  
the last ( and best , in my opinion ) of the episodes features john travolta ( again ) and samuel l  jackson ( in the best performance of any supporting actor ever ) as two slightly off-kilter hitmen trying to rid themselves of a bloody car  
they seek help with a friend of jackson's ( played by the q-man himself ) , desperately in need of a stress ball  
they end up calling a "" cleaner "" of sorts , played by the god among men harvey keitel , to help them out  
in the end , the story brilliantly loops around itself , actually ending where it began  
if you haven't already seen the film ( or even if you have , for that matter ) , i suggest you invest your money in a copy of the letterbox collectors edition  
it features two previously unreleased scenes and the original film restored how it was originally meant to be seen  
earlier today , i bought this version and watched it a few hours ago  
what the pan-and-scan did to this movie is inexcusable  
that version cut out , like , half the movie  
what i have missed in the past years of viewing this flick is amazing  
for instance , when travolta and jackson are in the apartment near the end , the widescreen version allows you to see that several things on the walls make crosses  
this might help explain the divine intervention that takes place  
just a theory    
one of the things that pisses people off so much about this movie is that tarantino borrowed alot of scenes from other movies ( i  e  
 "" psycho "" "" kiss me deadly "" , "" deliverance "" , etc  ) "
1,"linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogma's lead is nothing short of inexplicable  
she's still in fine form as bethany , an abortion clinic worker who's lost her faith  
one night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany's bedroom  
he is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god , and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-the fate of the universe depends on it  
god would do it him/herself , but he/she is    missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again  
bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the "" prophets "" jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double-duty ) , the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith's films thus far  
at some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and very black ) "" thirteenth apostle "" , and offers his assistance , as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek )  
it's a wild ride  
they're in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck , respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been ) , who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return  
loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates  
at one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets  
it's a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks , "" how corrupt are you ? ""  
wings of desire this ain't  
since debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors  
 ( chris rock is this film's only weak link-between jokes , he's wooden  ) 
his no-frills visual style hasn't changed much over the years , though ( dogma's widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another  
dogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition  
as well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever  
any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogma's pacing goes slack  
a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we've heard enough  
because his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki's bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time  
sure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated  
like tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker  
dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes ! 
smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan "" catholicism wow ! "" ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished  
i bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions  
proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever  
it's a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma  
the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ's , martin scorsese's 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis' controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the picture's content but to rumours and heresy  
there's a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against  
 ( not one of them had watched it  ) 
every single person refused  
smith and scorsese have a lot in common , and so do the two films in question , because both smith's bethany and scorsese's jesus are hollow shells without their faith  
in fact , dogma's denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown that's worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster  
 ( i felt sentimental about a religion i don't belong to  
now that's powerful filmmaking  ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through  
it's enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins  
my religion is movies  
when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine , in a roundabout way they're attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid  
i therefore feel that , although i'm no bible-thumper , i'm at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers "
1,
1,"since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they're portraying , it's fitting to say that "" beloved "" come as a real shock as a film  
it's confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i've seen all year , and that's not necessarily because of the three-hour running time  
 "" beloved "" is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , "" beloved "" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based )  
 "" beloved "" tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children  
when the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family  
sethe is proud , though , and will not move  
her sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation  
a couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging  
he has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot  
when he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies "" it ain't evil  
it's just sad  "" 
some more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears  
but when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house  
her name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills  
she stumbles around , half-grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk  
they let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down  
 "" beloved "" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story  
most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low-lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day psychoanalysts  
sethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , "" they took my milk ! "" 
worst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back  
she runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don't leave them alone  
when she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film , she says she doesn't regret it  
she killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did , and she has convinced herself she did the right thing  
of course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we aren't flat out told that until later on in the film  
beloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long  
thus , "" beloved "" becomes a sorta-redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci-fi classic , "" solaris , "" where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife , who commited suicide years before , has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system  
that film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories , how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past , and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us , it would control us completely  
 "" beloved "" moves along freely , without a lot of explanation , and for the most part , this is extremely respectable  
the most interesting films are the ones that don't explain everything for us , leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense  
sethe is never fully explained as a character , but we understand all her actions since she's being played by oprah winfrey  
it's been well over a decade since her last major performance in "" the color purple , "" but judging from these two films , i'll bet she's one of the best actresses working today    if 
she was strictly an actress  
her talk show , which i suppose is a great entity , has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress , and that's a shame because she brings so much to this movie  
emotion  
sadness  
strength  
watching the strong sethe , who's so afraid of the past that she's built a rather strong protective coating around herself , break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great  
she makes it real  
that's not to say this is a perfect film  
in fact , i'd wager to say that the fact that it's confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is  
while oprah's performance is powerful and easily sympathetic ( and i'm dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february ) , the structure of the film , which doesn't show what happened to her children till halfway through the film , prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film  
it doesn't necessarily move as though they're memories of one particular character , and by the end , it has lost control over sethe , and as she takes to bed , we are unable to truly identify with her anymore "
1,"books could be , and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy , and rightfully so  
this is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70s/early 80s , inspiring literally dozens of clones , from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day , and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre  
the special effects were groundbreaking , revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later  
literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it  
and now , george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy  
much has been and is still being made of the fact that mr  lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now  
some fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection , while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday's star wars updated with today's special effects wizardry  
either way , the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen , where it rightfully deserves to be seen  
can there be anyone in the world who doesn't know what star wars is about ? 
in a way , star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it  
it's a story about a young man's coming of age , a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire , a tale of swashbuckling and derring-do the likes of which haven't been seen on the silver screen in decades , strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn , and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world  
it's high adventure , incredible special effects , and    well , it's just an _experience_  
something about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation    and 
it's about to do so again  
this new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film's devoted fans , who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now  
interviews , trailers , leaks from within lucasfilm    all of these have been collected , collated , and placed on webpages for people to see ( pages such as http : //www  islandnet  com/~corona/films/details/sw4  html 
or , my personal favorite , http : //leopard  cs  latrobe  edu  au/~koukoula/ 
 )  
pictures of before and after have been placed side by side    even 
months before the movies were released , fans were making comparisons  
in some cases , the changes were nothing less than phenomenal , and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater  
the digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here , unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original  
for instance , in my personal favorite example , the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep , moss-covered carvings and etchings  
and mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling , booming city , with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing  
all the starships and fighters are now computer-animated , getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally made--and they look _fantastic_  
four and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added , including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply couldn't do it justice  
however , much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself  
the negatives , badly damaged by the ravages of time , were brightened and returned to their original splendor "

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
like its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent  
a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking  
the film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop  
as boogie nights opens , he's toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity  
recruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar  
wholeheartedly embraced by jack's troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c  reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his "" one special thing "" are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a "" big bright shining star ""  
his lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in  
the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr  anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious  
from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr  anderson's accomplished command of the camera is without question  
while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco's unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr  anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent  
it's a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker's career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it's somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he's clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he's borrowing from some of the best , and it's entirely effective within the context of this film  
while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it's also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour  
the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre-aids-scare period in american history where uninhibited , free-wheeling lifestyles abounded  
while much of the film's humour pertains to the characters' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope's demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get 'freaky deaky' with the music -- it's elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous  
a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie/dirk's bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking  
ably supported by a well-selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr  anderson's personal collection ) , there's a clear affection for the era in boogie nights  
it's the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film's promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters  
after the debacle with 1996's milos forman film , the people vs  
larry flynt , another finely-crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography-related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public  
however , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it's hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there's very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business  
the glimpses on the sets of jack horner's shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there's a candid matter-of-factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it's refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided  
if anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves  
jack horner's dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence )  
in both films , the world of quickie low-budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack's retort of "" there are shadows in light , baby "" to his cinematographer's complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood's "" it's not about the little details , it's about the big picture ! "" 
rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false  
in boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there's nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an 'artistic' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark  
much like the humour lacing ed wood , the laughs involving jack horner are double-edged ; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres , when jack breathes "" this is the best work i've ever done "" , it's genuinely funny , but given his utter sincerity , also possesses a tinge of sadness  
mr  anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter  
while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn't any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film's characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film's * protagonist * literally doesn't say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it's no wonder why the playfully inane "" how much can you bench ? "" 
banter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film's finest exchanges  
and while mr  anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it's problematic that some of the the threads given to the film's characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore's child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv-movie version of her character's story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions  
still , even if he doesn't always know what to do with his characters , mr  anderson most definitely captures their essences , and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious -- misguided , even aimless , hopelessly naive , self-destructive , insufferable : i loved them just the same  
in any case , it's hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired ( and ultimately best-executed ) scenes of the year : a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose-cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson ( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance , even if it's a small one ) in a suicidal drug deal scam , only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric ( the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger's "" sister christian "" on his stereo system is sheer brilliance ) flanked by an armed bodyguard  
if this scene already wasn't tense enough with these elements , mr  anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene , who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room , pushing the scene to a new , surreal level of delightful giddiness "

1,"in 1912 , a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america  
this ship was built to be the largest ship in the world , and she was  
she was also build to be one of the most luxurious , and that she was  
finally , she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not  
to get a ticket for this voyage you either : spent a life's savings to get to america to start life anew , were part of the upper class and had the money to spare , or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson  
jack dawson makes the trip , and happens to be at the right place at the right time  
rose dewitt bukater , a first class passenger , climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping  
thus is started a tale of romance and intrigue , and a tale of death and tragedy    
this movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago , an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia  
the movie titanic shows what happened , maybe not with a 100% degree of accuracy , but it still shows it very realisticaly  
now the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story  
it serves as both admirably , brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating  
this movie is very emotional simply because of what it is , but that alone is not enough  
the story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective  
movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency  
the attention to detail that was paid is remarkable  
the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting , with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie  
part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting , and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast  
the performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired  
the characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles  
looking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren't acting but are actually the characters in the movie  
the casting for the movie could really have been better , in my humble opinion that is  
one character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself  
yes , you read correctly , the ship is a character  
how is the titanic a character ? 
you ask well simple , a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you  
this character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this  
mr  cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense  
all this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp  
now , to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards  
the effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking  
in some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there , you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening ( if your imagination is good )  
the technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique  
the movie will leave you amazed at the effects , and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie , just humans and an oversized ship  
the movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions , the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes  
now that is not a feat accomplished by most movies , now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch , i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end  
the historical value of this movie is quite high , and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy , for it is extremely well done  
the method of telling the story is also good , maybe not totally unique but effective none the less  
regardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at  
the simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing  
if you get the chance to see this movie go ! ! ! 
it might not be the best movie in the world "
1,"here's a word analogy : amistad is to the lost world as schindler's list is to jurassic park  
in 1993 , after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit , many critics described schindler's list as the director's "" penance "" ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster )  
now , after a three-year layoff , spielberg is back with a vengeance  
once again , his summer release was special effects-loaded action/adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers  
now , following his 1993 pattern , he has fashioned another serious , inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity  
that film is amistad  
although not as masterful as schindler's list , amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture  
thematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact  
watching schindler's list was a powerful , almost spiritual , experience  
spielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three-plus hours later  
aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since  
amistad , while a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent  
the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that's not a surprise  
however , the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric , and , while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account , most of the basic facts are in order  
several , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film's dramatic force  
on the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired  
one stormy night during the summer of 1839 , the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape  
led by the lion-hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , they take control of the vessel , killing most of the crew  
adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa , they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey  
they are tricked , however , and the la amistad , which makes its way northward off the united states' eastern coastline , is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut  
the kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison , charged with murder and piracy  
the first men to come to the africans' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard )  
they are soon joined by roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a property attorney of little repute  
aided by advice from former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) , baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for , and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men , not property -- convinces the judge  
but powerful forces have aligned against baldwin's cause  
current president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , eager to please southern voters and 11-year old queen isabella of spain ( anna paquin ) , begins pulling strings behind-the-scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free  
at its heart , amistad is a tale of human courage  
cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to  
he is a free man , not a slave , and , while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle , he will not give it up  
effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou , whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention , cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies  
they are individuals , and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie's success  
to amplify this point , spielberg presents many scenes from the africans' point-of-view , detailing their occasionally-humorous observations about some of the white man's seemingly-strange "" rituals ""  
the larger struggle is , of course , one of defining humanity  
as the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as "" sub-human , "" so the pro-slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense  
the abolitionists regard the africans as men , but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property  
in a sense , the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war , which would break out less than three decades later , looming over everything  
amistad's presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating , making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history  
four claimants come forward against the africans : the state , which wants them tried for murder ; the queen of spain , who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an american/spanish treaty ; two american naval officers , who claim the right of high seas salvage ; and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad , who demand that their property be returned to them  
baldwin must counter all of these claims , while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque  
even though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier , they gradually learn to communicate  
aside from cinque , who is a fully-realized individual , characterization is spotty , but the acting is top-notch  
matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his "" pretty boy "" image to become baldwin , but the lawyer is never particularly well-defined outside of his role in the la amistad case  
likewise , while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan , they are never anything more than "" abolitionists "
1,"first , i am not a big fan of the x-files tv series  
i have nothing against it particularly , i just don't happen to watch it  
having said that , i can now say that i liked the x-files pretty well  
for us non-fans , there's nothing big going for it , but there are a lot of little things  
the movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 , 000 b  c  
two proto-humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside  
the alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien  
the movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy ( lucas black , from sling blade ) is captured by the same black ooze  
we then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder ( gillian anderson and david duchovny ) , who have been pulled off of their previous assignment ( investigations into the paranormal ) and put onto the bomb squad detail  
a caller has threatened a federal building in dallas , texas  
on a hunch , mulder checks out the building across the street , and , wouldn't you know it , he turns out to be right  
the fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse  
five people die in the blast , and when mulder learns who the victims were , a light bulb goes on over his head  
the two agents team up to investigate , against fbi orders , the links mulder has made  
their search leads them back to the north texas cave , all across the country , and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to "" the truth  "" 
the plot , and "" the truth , "" are uninspired  
i got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me  
it didn't  
the possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them  
but the point of the x-files is not what the truth is , but the extent to which it has been hidden  
it's a slightly more interesting angle , but it still raises expectations about that "" truth "" too high  
if this were the whole film , i would say the movie was mediocre , perhaps even boring  
but there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it  
the pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest  
before the audience can get tired of one location , the agents follow a hot tip to another location , and so on and so forth  
the locations are not all computer-generated sets , either  
there are some artificial settings , but the desert night of nevada , the edge of suburbia in texas , and the endless fields of snow in antarctica ( actually somewhere in north america  ) 
make this fantastic film feel more real  
ward russell's cinematography is very good  
the overall look is dark and ominous , appropriate to the intended tone of the film's plot  
russell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding  
when the movie is set in darkness , the picture quality is still rich and detailed  
finally , and specifically , there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train  
i don't know if the shot is faked in any way , but it looks dangerous , and it looks great  
the movie's soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film  ( skip 
to the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie - there is a spoiler in the following sentences  ) during the opening prehistoric sequence , a howling wind dogs the soundtrack , never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound  
in one of the movie's most effective sequences , metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees  
the visuals of the scene are good , but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound  
there was no question as to who the movie's stars would be  
even so , duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good combination  
both are easy on the eyes and together , they have some good timing , banter , and energy "

1,"seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented )  
one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise  
with some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie  
there's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there  
the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict  
the premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist  
we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely  
later he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right  
the fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling  
this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone  
the man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him  
in fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc  until after we've observed them for a while  
but in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story  
eventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police  
we met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time  
two other important characters are also introduced : dr  daniel p  schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies  
it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film  
he also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story  
but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo  
everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities  
however , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential  
by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax  
everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction  
but , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off  ' 
for reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' )  
the aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight  
at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then  
this premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard  
he does provide some explanations such as that dr  schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form  
the aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not  
in the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world  
however , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is  
the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either )  
for example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending  
and that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense  
ironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world  
with `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message  
still , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable  
there's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does "
1,
1,"cinema has been around for about a hundred years now  ? 
it's not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film , but i'd like to think that i'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time  
recently , i've seen the films of hitchcock , capra , fellini , godard , kurosawa , chaplin , lang , and many others  
 ? those men were talented artists , and their films reflect their genius  ? 
they are likely to be remembered for  
  
  
well , quite a while  ? 
i like this film , too  ? 
yes , it's a disaster-slash-action movie  ? 
true , its budget is a lot more money than i'll ever see in my lifetime  ? 
and there's not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money  ? 
in fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would've been more profitable  
i certainly don't care what their intentions were , because michael bay ( the rock ) is such a skilled director that i doubt he'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through  
of course , skillful direction doesn't complete the package , but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together  
the story is well-thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) , the acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters  
yes , you read that right  
armageddon actually has characters you can care about ! 
if you don't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be  
if you've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story  
it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film  
so , it's up to the u  s  government to stop it  
 ( why the u  s  is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated  ) 
their plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within  
the head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis )  
his group of men is a colorful bunch , including a  j  
 ( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi )  
there's also an interesting triangle formed between a  j  , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry's daughter  
a  j  
and grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad isn't too happy with the situation  
it's absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you'd like to call armageddon  
it's not about story -- it's about viscera and action , and thrills-a-minute , and all that stuff  
it's incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds' thought to what actually happens  
but bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better  
i think most of the budget went to cameras alone , because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles  
take the spectacular opening scene , for instance , in which a meteor shower obliterates new york "

1,"you may not have heard of lucas , or if you have , you might not think much of it  
probably because it stars corey haim , or maybe because it's about a little geek who collects insects , or maybe because it doesn't feature slick one-liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80's  
however , you have been missing out on a true masterpeice , the best film of 1986 , and the best film about adolescent life ever made  
corey haim stars as lucas bligh , a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair , thick glasses , and an interest in insects and other outdoor life  
one day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him  
her name is maggie , a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty , with lovely red hair and a sweet , innocent complexion  
maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her , but somehow he interests her , and soon they are talking and getting to know one another  
they gradually become good friends , and spend the summer together doing various things , such as studying insects ( namely locusts , who come out of hiding once every 17 years ) , playing tennis , and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover  
lucas is obviously in love with maggie , and while she is charmed by him , it's clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend  
this is not clear to lucas , however  
he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate , and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what's about to happen  
we soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally  
they throw him on stage , right in front of his beloved maggie  
surprisingly , he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around , but he takes it too far , and is embarassed in front of the entire school  
the next scene is brilliant  
maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally  
she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened  
he rails back against her , in a cruel unfair fashion  
in lesser movies this would've turned into a confrontation between the two characters  
but maggie is written smarter than that  
she understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him  
next we are introduced to another great character named cappie ( charlie sheen )  
he is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend  
what's interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks  
of course anyone with a brain can tell what's gonna happen next  
cappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas' relationship  
this begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone  
she's been assigned to show him how to operate the washer/dryer so he can clean his shirt  
maggie is charmed by cappie's tender undertsanding demeanor , not to mention his shirtless body  
this scene is so delicate and sweet , but cappie still has a girlfriend , preventing either one from acting on their desires  
desperately trying to puncture the tension , cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room  
it's not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend ( in the films only subpar scene )  
lucas finally figures out what's going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance  
this causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself , such as try out for the football team  
the last third of the film revolves around this attempt  
while the idea seems cliched , the way it is executed is not  
there are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up  
dave grusin's memorable score , played at the perfect moments , certainly helps  
lucas is filled with great performances  
forget everything you know about corey haim  
back in 1986 he had talent , and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3-dimensional performance filled with anger , humor , and pain  
kerri green is very appealing as maggie , showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her  
sheen's cappie is almost too good to be true , but sheen makes him beleivable , especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas "

1,"with the release of gattaca , i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens , or aliens in general  
hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films , but what was usually lacking was a good story    
and good characters    
and good acting , etc ( contact being the exception )  
and for some reason , hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth  
the closest , that i have seen anyway , was 2001 : a space odyssey , which made mankind an alien race themselves , being dwarfed by the technology which they created  
now comes gattaca , another film about technology reigning supreme , except here on our planet  
the difference between 2001 and this one is simple : gattaca is more frightening  
most of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering  
using this premise , writer/director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills  
unfortunately , due to a lack of advertising , i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office  
since seeing the film , i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca  
lately , however , i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca  
most people don't even realize that it is a film  
despite this fact , i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it  
niccol's film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter , better produced , and more realistic  
gattaca begins in the 21st century  
procreating is now done in a petri dish , and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it  
natural child birth is considered old-fashioned  
we are introduced to jerome morrow ( ethan hawke ) , an employee of the gattaca space program  
one of the directors of the program has been murdered , and the main suspect is one vincent freeman  
the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman  
vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love  
however , after his birth , and through several genetic tests , doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99% chance of a weak heart , as well as poor eye sight and a short life span  
as a result , both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics  
anton ( loren dean ) is produced without flaws , and the competition between brothers spawns  
vincent has a dream to fly a solo-flight around the titan , the 14th moon of saturn , but because of his condition , gattaca , and society in general , forces him to do menial labor around the company  
labeled an "" in-valid , "" vincent's dream seems impossible , until he meets a black-market dna specialist , german ( tony shalhoub )  
german introduces him to a "" valid "" who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident  
jerome morrow ( jude law ) agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools ( urine , blood , skin and hair samples , etc  ) that he will need to get past gattaca's tight security  
in exchange , vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship  
after the murder , however , his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincent's eyelashes left at the scene of the crime  
irene cassini ( uma thurman ) is a genetically flawed "" valid "" working for gattaca , and she begins to fall in love with vincent/jerome  
gattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time  
only two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years ( contact and the arrival ) and gattaca will rank among them  
unfortunately , whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effects-laden films , it normally gets buried  
the second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs  
the orange glow of gattaca's scenes are impressive , but the sets deserve most of the credit "

rated pg-13 for mild language , adult situations , drug use , martial art action and violence  
107 minutes  
super 35mm / panavision ( 2  35 : 1 ) 
what can you say about jackie chan that hasn't already been said  
since the release of 'rumble in the bronx "" back in 1996 ( the u  s  release ) , jackie has become a fairly recognizable commodity on america's video shelves  
having made over 80 films , jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of action-comedy to the west  
his latest release , "" shanghai noon "" , is a joyful tribute / spoof of the classic western  
and by adding jackie chan into the genre , the tag line for the film ( "" the western gets a kick in the pants "" ) rings true  
jackie stars as chon wang , a lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china  
the royal princess pei pei ( lucy liu ) is set to be married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture  
unwilling to follow her father's wishes , princess pei pei with the assistance of her english tutor , decides to escape to america  
but this is all a ploy devised by exiled guard lo fong , which will lead to the princess' kidnapping and ransom  
unable to take any legal action , the ransom demands are met and three of the forbidden city's bravest guards ( played by cui ya hi , rong guang yu , and eric chen ) are ordered to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson city , nevada  
chon wang pleads with the imperial court and is given permission to join the team , as he is looked upon as a buffoon  
on a train in the u  s  jackie meets up with bandit roy o'bannon ( owen wilson )  
he is much less of a bandit than he is a glory hog , looking simple for the notoriety and fame that being a bandit will bring him  
with his gang in tow , roy attempts to rob the train , when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court , who also happens to be chon wang's uncle  
chon wang gives chase , foiling the attempted robbery , but also leaving himself stranded in the desert  
as the disgraced guard wanders through the desert , he again comes upon roy , who has been left for dead by his former gang  
buried up to his neck in the desert , roy pleads with chon to dig him out  
chon demands to know where carson city is  
roy directs him , and chon leaves  
but not before sticking two chopsticks into roy's mouth and telling him to dig himself  
chon soon finds himself confronted by angry crow warriors , a friendly sioux tribe , gunslingers , a horse that thinks and behaves like a dog and an indian bride ( brandon merrill ) , before once again running into roy  
 "" shanghai noon "" is just good fun  
the chemistry between the cast is remarkable  
the performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film  
jackie's performance is as good as anything he's done before  
he's not called on to do much acting here , as the character is not written with any depth  
but jackie's natural charisma shines through , and his comic timing is so perfect , both physically and ( surprise ) verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on  
owen wilson , last seen in the embarrassing remake of "" the haunting "" , gives a good natured performance as roy o'bannon  
his innocence is refreshing and fun  
a bad guy that's not really bad  
his scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis  
lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script , but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant  
the character is a noble woman of status and wealth , but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment  
the rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances  
nothing here is realistic , mind you  
 "" shanghai noon "" is first and foremost a light , jovial film "
1,"i was pleasantly surprised by this film  
with a budget topping $200 million , i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century's greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see  
how much could you dress up the sets ? 
how many models and computer effects could you use ? 
how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks ? 
oh , if i've just given away part of the plot for you , go back to school  
after having viewed titanic , however , i found it to be a well-paced , well-designed , and overall well-made movie  
there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic , but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i've seen  
titanic tells its story in two time periods  
it starts out in the present , when ocean explorer brock lovett ( bill paxton ) and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic , searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship  
what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace , which is broadcast on the news  
the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett , who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas  
there she tells her story to lovett and his team  
in 1912 , rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) , a young lady belonging to society's upper class , boards the titanic for the ship's first atlantic crossing , from southampton , england to new york  
she is engaged to cal hockley ( billy zane ) , an heir to old money , and a snob in every sense of the word  
on board , rose feels the stifling trappings of high-society's expectations , and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic's stern , but is saved from her self-proclaimed fate by jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a passenger in third-class ( "" steerage "" , as it's referred to ) , who talks her out of jumping  
although for rose the attraction is not immediate , a love affair soon develops between the two , which endangers rose's social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal  
the story sounds very simple , and perhaps even unexciting , but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron , a good movie comes through  
dicaprio is marvelous as the young , but worldly-wise jack , playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors  
his is a character that is immediately likable , as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations  
girls are going to swoon over him  
winslet also proves herself a good actress , delivering her lines convincingly , and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable  
the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character's upbringing  
simply by judgment of her gait , i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper-crust debutante  
rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess , she sometimes looks positively clumsy , and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting  
billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal , since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him  
his features are such that even when he smiles , there's something mistrustful about him , and when he scowls , he is evil incarnate  
he's something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher , but a cheaper model  
like dicaprio and winslet , zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well  
backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy , cal's personal assistant ( or "" man "" as they said at the turn of the century )  
no matter who else is in the cast , you can always count on a good performance by warner , who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match  
additionally , there are a number of smaller fictional and non-fictional roles thrown in for color , such as kathy bates as "" the unsinkable "" molly brown , danny nucci as jack's friend fabrizio de rossi , eric braeden as john jacob astor , and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie  
nice to see dr  bombay getting work  
also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die  
this by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic , but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship's crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the first-class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else  
in this way , titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures  
you don't just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop , but a very real account of class struggle as well  
as i mentioned before , the budget for this film was tremendous , and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects  
the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail , and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic  
with regard to the exteriors , i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale  
cameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank , but only had room for 90% , and therefore had to computer-generate the remaining 40 feet  
could've fooled me and everyone else in the theater , as the splicing is seamless  
also of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning  
we are told of where the iceberg struck the ship , how the flooding occurred , the way the ship sank , and why it did so in that manner  
these technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening , and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction , in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion "

1,"veteran actor clint eastwood has never looked as grizzled as he does in true crime , his latest directorial effort  
when steve everett ( his newest character ) gets angry at someone , he glares them down with those famous dirty harry eyes , furrows his brow and frowns like a grizzly bear who's just lost his cubs  
eastwood has played some particularly despicable characters in his time , but everett could just take the cake  
he gets my vote , at least , partly because `ev' is a drunken affair-a-week womanizer who has many relationship problems , very few of which are with his wife ( diane venora )  
when his colleague at the oakland tribune is in an ugly car wreck and dies , everett must take over for her at a vital interview session  
the interview is with frank beacham ( isaiah washington ) , a death-row inmate set to die at midnight for the murder of a pregnant convenience store clerk  
eastwood furrows his brow  
as everett gradually finds information , he realizes that beacham could very well be innocent  
he interviews a key witness ( michael jeter ) , who claims that he burst in the door at pocum's foods because his car had overheated , only to see beacham standing over the dead woman's body , blood on his suspenders , gun in hand  
but everett protests : how could he have seen the gun , which was lowered by his side , with the potato chip rack in front of him ? 
jeter doesn't know what he's talking about  
eastwood furrows his brow  
crinkled expressions and all , clint is the centre of energy of true crime  
the film is by no means a standard action/suspense yarn , but a thoughtful human story in which the characters come before the shoot-outs  
isaiah washington has a break-out performance as frank beacham , and scenes with him and his weary wife ( lisa gay hamilton ) are truly heartfelt moments  
but the best scenes are ones that feature eastwood duking it out with those in authority over him  
denis leary , as everett's editor and boss , has more than a few memorable moments of restrained anger ( you see , ev is sleeping with his wife )  
but hands down , the most enjoyable segments of the film are when james woods is on camera  
playing the big boss alan mann , woods and eastwood create amusing chemistry and laugh-out-loud punchlines  
when true crime opts for a high-speed chase to the governer's house at the finale , the quality of film-making takes an abrupt nosedive  
eastwood was so successful with colorful character portraits that he didn't need to switch lanes  
true crime is a tension-building , intriguing drama showcase for the talented director and star  
this is a road block he could have easily dismissed ( i furrow my brow )

1,"most sequels don't do what they're supposed to do like "" toy story 2 "" does  
far too many of them end up re-hashing the original and adding very little  
is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors ? 
thankfully , "" toy story 2 "" is a wonderful exception  
i can't remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one  
it's yet another sign that pixar , the acclaimed animation studio behind "" toy story "" and "" a bug's life , "" is still at the top of its game  
woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit "" toy story , "" and things have changed a bit since the last one ended  
woody ( voiced by tom hanks ) is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp  
in his absence , he has assigned buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , now comfortable in his role as a toy , to take charge  
unfortunately , woody's trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale , and is stolen by an over-zealous toy collector ( wayne knight )  
off to save him are buzz and members of the old "" toy gang , "" including mr  potato head ( don rickles ) , rex the nervous dinosaur ( wallace shawn ) , hamm the piggy bank ( john ratzenberger ) , and slinky dog ( jim varney )  
while in captivity , woody makes a startling discovery : he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a 1950's children's show entitled "" woody's roundup  "" 
he meets the show's other characters , which include jesse ( joan cusack ) , his cowgirl sidekick , the wise old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) , and bullseye , his trusty horse  
they have all been anxiously awaiting woody's arrival , as once their set is completed , they will be sold to a japanese toy museum , and finally escape storage forever  
this means woody now faces a difficult choice  
with his friends coming to rescue him , does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy , or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever ? 
as in the original film , "" toy story 2 "" contains first-rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there  
reportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct-to-video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters  
the film is well worth seeing on the big screen  
the colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more "" human  "" 
the animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable  
there are so many impressive sequences that i'd find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al' s toy barn , the store owned by woody's captor  
pixar's rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it  
the voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development  
tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice  
it was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim  
all the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent  
several new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work  
 "" toy story 2 "" is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie  
woody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn't yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like  
the new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner  
it may be computer-animated , and it may have sappy music , but it's downright touching  
the script , despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers , is endlessly clever and inventive , especially considering that it's a sequel  
the reason "" toy story 2 "" works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original's success by re-doing the same story and using the same characters  
not this one  
we get character change , new characters , and new issues brought up  
 "" toy story 2 "" is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself  
there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here  
the humor is sharp and witty , with something to amuse both kids and adults  
there are funny asides to films such as "" star wars "" and "" jurassic park , "" among others , new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock 'em sock 'em robots , and appearances from other pixar efforts "" a bug's life "" and the 1997 short "" geri 's game  "" 
 ( geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody's broken arm  ) 
the action is fast and furious , and the chases ( in the street , in a toy store , in an elevator , on a baggage carousel , and in an airplane ) keep getting bigger and better  
 "" toy story 2 "" never grows stagnant , because there is always something new to hold your interest  
the more you pay attention to it , the more rewarding it is "

1,"mike myers , you certainly did throw us a ? frickin' bone here in what you call ? the biggest austin powers adventure yet  ' 
austin powers : the spy who shagged me is the sequel to the 1997 smash comedy austin powers : international man of mystery  
many are skeptical about sequels , saying that the sequel is never better or as good as the original , but austin powers : tswsm goes beyond the first film  
austin powers : the spy who shagged me stars mike myers in three different roles  
he reprises his role as the title character , austin powers , the shagadelic spy whose body was frozen in 1967 , and unfrozen in 1997 to stop his long time nemesis dr  evil , also played by mike myers , from destroying the earth  
tswsm leaves off where the original stopped , with dr  evil's ? frisch's big boy' space capsule floating through space  
dr  evil returns back to earth by ejecting from his capsule , plotting to go back in his time machine to the year 1967 , in which he plans to steal austin powers' "" mojo "" , what keeps austin going with spy talents  
upon his return to his secret lair , which is now a starbucks coffee shop , dr  evil learns that his evil henchman , which includes the returning robert wagner as number 2 and mindy sterling as frau , have created a 1/8 size clone of dr  evil , which is later named mini me  
the evil mini me replaces scott evil , played by seth green , as dr  evil's son in the madman's mind , because dr  evil thinks of scott to be only "" quasi-evil  "" 
dr  evil has always wanted a son that is evil just like him , and now he has one  
dr  evil tells mini me , "" you complete me , "" in a loving manner  
dr  evil loving ? 
wow ! 
mike myers' third role is as fat bastard , a scottish henchman of dr  evil's , who is sent to steal the mojo from austin powers' frozen body  
austin powers learns of dr  evil's trip back into the 60s , and uses his own time machine to take him back to 1967 , to try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold of it  
once arriving in the year 1967 , austin travels to his "" pad "" , his smashing home/dance club , where he meets felicity shagwell , played by heather graham , a cia agent who is willing to help him in his journey to stop dr  evil  
as the film progresses , hilarious one liners are thrown at us , mainly by dr  evil , for example , "" don't go there , girlfriend ! "" 
to the president of the united states  
many witty gags take place , note the entire tent scene , and just plain , funny scenes which are so stupid- they're funny come a dozen per fifteen minutes  
take for example , scott evil going on the jerry springer show complaining about how evil his father is  
the way austin powers : tswsm uses its humor is clever , throwing a hilarious scene at you , followed by five minutes of one liners , followed by another outrageous scene , so you never stop laughing  
there was honestly not one moment in austin powers : tswsm where i wasn't laughing  
the last film that i laughed so hard in , was well , austin powers ! 
it is apparent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it  
the film even makes fun of itself in a line , something along the lines of , "" it's funny how england and southern california look nothing alike  "" 
tswsm was filmed in southern california , but was supposed to take place in england  
i can tell you one thing- he is having a lot of fun with this enormously popular character , which is all over television , newspapers , magazines , and the movie theaters  
i believe that dr  evil got more attention in the tswsm than austin powers did  
dr  evil provided more laughs , more memorable moments , and more interesting dialogue than austin did this time around , who seems to missing the funny touch that he had in the first film  
i felt that austin really did have his mojo taken away , but from screenplay writer mike myers , not fat bastard  
also making a great addition to the series is mini me , who is played by verne troyer "

1," ""   it's certainly more than just a monster story   "" 
- kenneth branagh , director/actor/co-writer of mary shelley's frankenstein  
kenneth branagh's new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein-films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world , including the most controversial version of them all - directed by james whale  
the dark and stormy nights , the lightning bolts , the charnel houses of spare body parts , the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful  
but the center of the film , quieter and more thoughtful , contains the real story  
horror-fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror  
branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues : morality , philosophy and human elements of the story , and not on old fashioned horror cliches  
his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel  
the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean  
the year is 1794  
a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters  
his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs  
as the ice closes around his ship , a figure appears on the horizon  
it's a man

1,"it is easy to see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his a  i  
artificial intelligence , just as it is understandable why spielberg was attracted to the material  
for here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home , an outcast seeking family , themes very familiar from most of spielberg's body of work from sugarland express to close encounters of the third kind to e  t  
to empire of the sun to hook to saving private ryan , naming just a few examples  
a  i  is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies  
it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances  
the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions , and with the number of births limited by the government , many couples are yearning for children  
and professor hobby ( william hurt ) has the solution  
a robotic boy named david ( haley joel osment ) , who is programmed to love  
as a test , david is placed with henry swinton ( sam robards ) and his wife , monica ( frances o'connor )  
their natural-born son has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be found for his illness  
the first third of a  i  
deals with david's life with the swintons and how that is changed by the recovery and return of their son , martin  
circumstances force david to be cut off from the swintons  
he is abandoned and alone  
david , highly influenced by the fairy tale , pinocchio , feels that if he becomes a real boy he can rekindle monica's love for him  
the film's second act follows david's search for the blue fairy , whom he believes will be able to fulfill his wish  
during these adventures he meets and is helped by gigolo joe ( jude law ) , a robot who specializes in sex  
spielberg is at his top form in this sequence , offering a brutal "" flesh fair "" where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying customers  
here , is where kubrick's influence is strongly felt , as the movie explores the fear and distrust humans have for robots  
the savagery conjures up images from the late director's a clockwork orange  
at about two hours and 30 minutes , the film begins to falter during the last 20 minutes , a sequence that seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed from close encounters  
it is all very anti-climatic and jarring  
these scenes seem almost superfluous , as if from a different film  
a  i  is a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg-13 rating  
it is a story combining hope and intolerance , sacrifice and bigotry , and while it does not coalesce perfectly , the movie does offer some disturbing images  
but a  i  
is really a showcase for the acting talents of the amazing young osment  
if ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination , it is this lad , who brings a sense of joy and wonder to the role of david , a being created for the express purpose of loving  
he shines when with monica , beaming with love , as eager as a puppy to please  
after being left in the woods , he is confused , lost , hurt , focusing on one objective : to become a real boy and find his way home so he can redeem himself in his mother's eyes  
law is pleasant as the care-free robot who really doesn't understand david's quest , but is nonetheless happy to help him on his journey  
probably the toughest role is o'connor's monica  
playing an emotional fragile woman who sees david as a substitute for her lost martin , she grows conflicted after her boy returns and she begins to perceive david not as a second chance , but as a threat to her family  
she gives her character enough emotional chaos that you cannot fault her for her course of action "
1," "" oh my god , i sounded just like a mother ! "" 
mrs  pascal , played with devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold , tells her son  
 "" didn't i sound just like a mother ? "" 
 "" you are a mother , "" her son marty tells her disgustedly  
 "" i know , but i still can't believe it  
i look at you people and wonder , how did you ever fit in my womb ? "" 
marty , you see , is a grown-up twin  
although his sister , who thinks she is jackie-o , is certifiably insane , marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes  
mother and daughter , played in a brilliant performance by parker posey , are both varying degrees of wacko  
most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and mean-spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is  
the daughter's fantasy of being jackie-o is probably the most sane part of her being  
mrs  pascal is the sort that will not let jackie-o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level  
she explains to marty's new fiancee , lesly ( tori spelling ) , soon after their first meeting that jackie-o was holding marty's private part when she came out of the womb  
the dialog by wendy macleod , based on the play by mark waters , is so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment  
the script , reminiscent of a david mamet play , flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters  
the exaggerated setup has lesly and marty arriving at the family's out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane  
in this storm are two sane individuals  
the fiancee is a giddy , school-girl type , embarrassed by everything , a complete contrast to her rival jackie-o's bitter pseudo-sophistication  
as the two twins' younger brother , anthony , freddie prinze jr  plays the all-america boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his brother's fiancee that night  
 "" we all have our secrets , "" jackie-o tells her potential sister-in-law , and boy , does she have a few  
this is a house filled with them  
 ( when lesly calls it the family's "" home "" to mrs  pascal -- they've never had a visitor before lesly -- mrs  pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly is talking about their "" house  "" ) 
in a film that gives new meaning to the phrase , "" made for each other , "" the twin's biggest , but not their only secret , is that they've had a long-term incestuous relationship  
they don't like to discuss it , although they are not particularly ashamed of it  
perfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy , this story never pulls its punches  
jackie-o tries in many ways , few subtle , to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his  
in one scene marty and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackie-o pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands  
marty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy  
the chemistry between parker posey and josh hamilton is nothing short of amazing  
they put down their little brother and most of the other sane people in the world  
their ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best  
director mark waters keeps the show's energy level high and lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace  
his crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it  
jackie-o is temperamentally incapable of being nice  
and being jealous , she cuts lesly down mercilessly  
 "" were you poor ? "" 
jackie-o asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime of growing up impoverished  
 "" did you eat pies ? 
chicken pot pies ? "" 
 "" pancakes actually , lots of pancakes , "" lesly replies with her usual sincerity  
 "" a donut king , so is she like the queen ? , "" 
jackie-o cattily inquires of marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king  
 "" are we entertaining royalty ? "" 
with rolfe kent's whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the story is headed  
will it end in a big emotional explosion , a murder , people slowly cutting each other up with words , a familial catharsis , a weather disaster or what ? 
the emotionally charged play is clearly going somewhere , and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell  
i'll not say more except that the ending is perfect and a bit of a surprise "

1,"this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city , of james cameron's most heralded film , titanic  
postponed from last summer , with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history , this was one film i was eager to preview  
so , is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday ? 
my best guess     it will sink , though with many awards attatched to its hull  
no doubt , titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made  
it boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date  
to see a ship fall apart , with actual people running across the ship , flying across the deck , and falling to the water , is just amazing to look at  
the effects are so stunningly realistic , you would swear you were looking at actual footage  
but titanic is more than a disaster movie , and that's where the problem lies  
there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise  
i'll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you : 
the film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic  
we see actual footage of the sunken ship , as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor  
bill paxton leads the expedition , in search of sunken treasure  
what he finds instead , leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage  
we meet rose ( kate winslet ) , a young woman , who comes from an upper-class family  
rose is to be wed to a man she does not love  
we meet jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a young man , who comes from a poor financial background , and wins a ticket aboard the titanic , in a poker game  
the two meet under interesting circumstances , and the love story begins  
add in a jealous fiance , and a not-so-nice law officer played by david warner , and you have a story that , well , gets a bit overplayed and oversappy  
i must add , at this point , that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates , as a woman with "" new money "" who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship  
she is a pleasure to see on screen  
when the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1 : 40 into the film , and eventually sinks , you never really feel for any of these characters  
the film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on  
the effects are tremendous  
from the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room , to a doomed ship cracking at the seams , this is an effects picture that looks and sounds like no other  
we saw titanic in dolby digital surround , and by far , it is the best sounding movie i have ever seen  
my friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard  
when people are in the water , at film's end , you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles  
titanic runs far too long  
the movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length  
and , while most of the first 2  5 hours runs very fast and well-paced , the final 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop , and you realize that this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends  
don't get me wrong about titanic     it's 
not a bad as i am making it out to be  
it really is an exceptionaly well-made film  
the costumes and sets are incredible , and true to the time period  
the ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form , as we see actual pictures of the modern-day wreckage , transformed into the movie depiction "

1," "" i'd rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell , "" earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher  
with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister , hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story  
he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american , and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation  
from elmer gantry on , we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church  
well , think again , for the apostle , which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade , does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister , and by implication all , the rest of organized religion  
instead it gives us a highly devout man , who certainly has his foibles , but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god  
and arguably just as surprising , the good-spirited film is no comedy , even if it does have humorous moments  
instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures  
when in the privacy of his attic , robert duvall , as texas preacher euliss "" sonny "" dewey , argues sternly with his lord , the scene shares a kinship with emily watson's character crying out for her god in breaking the waves's most powerful scene  
the body of the story starts with sonny's coming upon an horrific auto accident , which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters  
with his well worn bible in hand , sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident's dying victims  
the scowling police officer orders him to go away , and , after he has tried to work his miracles , sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord's work  
robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film's director , writer , executive producer , and chief financier  
rarely has a movie been such a labor of love  
with a white suit , peach-colored shirt and tie , and dark sunglasses , sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher  
duvall has every movement down pat  
even when he is walking down the street , the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy  
he dances and claps all the way  
sonny's churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep-voiced black orators , but his rhetoric is always competitive  
 "" i may be on the devil's hit-list , but i'm on god's mailing list , "" he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent  
and they lap it up  
people jump up , scream , "" praise the lord ! "" 
and mean it  
the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable  
but sonny is no saint  
it turns out that he has a wandering eye , which angers his wife jessie , played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett  
jessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church's youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny's church , leaving him unemployed  
sonny , letting his temper get the best of him , does something foolish , which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever  
the bulk of the film occurs in a small , predominately black church in louisiana , which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church ( "" one way road to heaven : holiness temple "" ) with an enthusiastic flock  
in this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e  f  the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church  
he asks his members to tithe , but he gives all of his money  
and his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks  
a man who can't stand to be still , he tells one of his friends , "" i quit school because i didn't like recess  "" 
in his new town he meets toosie ( miranda richardson ) , who , like him , has a family that she hasn't seen in a while  
his romance with the separated woman , like the rest of the film , doesn't follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies  
billy bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker  
his confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show's many surprising scenes , again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take  
although it probably couldn't have ended any other way , the movie does wrap things up nicely  
and don't miss the sweet epilogue during the film's closing credits  
a tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film  
the apostle runs a little too long at 2 : 12  
it is rated pg-13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up "

1,"contact is a nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagan's only novel  
it details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of a young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway ( jodie foster )  
we first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico , where she is part of the seti ( search for extraterrestrial intelligence ) project  
her research is quickly killed , however , by her highly political david drumlin ( tom skerrit ) , who disdains "" pure research "" in favor of science with "" commercial applications  
she goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s  r  
hadden ( john hurt )  
then , with that money just about to finally dry up , ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal  
in the movie's most exciting and believable sequence , ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega  
at first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers , then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before  
further decoding , with hadden's help , reveals another layer to message , containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine  
it appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens' home world  
of course , the big question becomes "" who gets to ride it ? "" 
 ( right after "" who's gonna pay for this thing ? "" )  
to boil it down , ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism , while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith  
drumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform ( apparently to keep "" godless science "" from talking to god , or something like that )  
then hadden reappears with startling news  
he has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie , in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest  
ellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream-like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels , where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father ( david morse )  
when she returns home , no one believes her  
she was not even gone for one second , they say , even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours  
her story is officially discredited , although believed by a large segment of the public ( who don't even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static  
  
  
eighteen hours worth of static )  
there is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first  
ellie arroway is a well-rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working  
neither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs , but that's a tough standard to meet  
ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures  
her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally  
drumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble  
hadden obviously has affection for ellie , but in the end he seems to see her as his creation , nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board  
even palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , ellie's love interest , takes a paternalistic interest in ellie , seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses  
the film is technically impressive , especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine  
the part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain  
the film falls apart when dealing with its central theme , the dichotomy between science and religion  
this is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved  
the film presents science pretty well ( until the end ) so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith  
religious people are presented as shallow caricatures  
rob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank ( very subtle , guys ) , the voice of the religious right  
another religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine ( jake busey )  
the only really fleshed-out religious person , palmer joss , is supposed to be a minister of some sort , but his actual faith is left pretty vague  
i can't even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian  
all we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about pre-marital sex "
1,"martin scorsese's films used to intimidate me  
because of his reputation , i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks  
as much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something  
i learned from scorsese's casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story  
no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies  
for example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other  
there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on  
or toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building  
again , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing  
i don't mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking  
but he simply uses the best tool for the job  
it shouldn't have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward  
the movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet  
the movie's title is another name for the dalai lama which means "" ocean of wisdom  "" 
his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story  
 ( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film's opening shot and watch where it is repeated  ) 
we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old  
his curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama  
a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before  
several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items  
the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own  
the boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama  
scorsese and long-time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk  
before selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation  
sometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice  
either way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader  
>from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama's spirit and the future leader of a nation  
it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child  
in the u  s  it might be grounds for a call to social services  
but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage  
neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable , well-rounded person  
certain patterns take shape over the years  
for example , the dalai lama is fascinated by technology  
radios , clocks , and telescopes are some of his favorite toys  
when he is old enough to accept his leadership , he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet  
he also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain , including herd animals  
it's nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter  
but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet's gigantic neighbor , china  
tibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china , as , first the propaganda , then the political pressure , and finally the armies , come across their common border  
the chinese invasion is so successful that the lama's life is in danger if he stays  
the movie ends when , after much agonizing , the dalai lama leaves tibet for india "

1,"i like movies with albert brooks , and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks  
lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies  
his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today , inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator  
you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film , while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent "" talk films "" which are finding their way into theaters  
the situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with , but even if we can't , brooks has the talent to make them comfortable , and therefore we laugh  
teenagers and jim carrey fans probably won't find an albert brooks movie very funny , but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will  
put simply , brooks' comedy is intelligent  
mother is albert brooks' latest film , and it does not disappoint  
brooks plays john henderson , a middle-aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce  
he makes an attempt at dating , but fails miserably  
he then has dinner with his brother jeff ( rob morrow ) , a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life  
jeff has a good job , a loving family , and most of all , a warm relationship with their mother beatrice ( debbie reynolds )  
after dinner , john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice , and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky-dory the dialog is  
in comparison , beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him , and john gives it right back to her  
at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john's life , she says , "" i love you , "" and john replies with , "" i know you think you do  "" 
the thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading  
it's the kind that goes something like , "" yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but     "" 
it seems as though nothing he does makes her happy  
there's always the big but  
john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self-esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner  
he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is  
 "" a great experiment "" , he calls it  
brooks' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother  
there's a scene where john has just arrived at his mother's house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the "" great experiment "" , beatrice asks , "" now explain to me again why you don't want to stay at a hotel  "" 
she still doesn't get it , and it is absolutely hilarious  
in the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh  
she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over  
when john points out the ice on the sherbet , beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze  
 "" you've named the ice ? "" 
asks john  
he's also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator , such as a twenty-pound block of cheese  
 "" the freezer was a good invention , "" says john , "" but it's not supposed to be used for everything  
that's why it's smaller than the refrigerator  "" 
it's something most of us find strangely familiar  
brooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur  
for example , in defending your life , his and meryl streep's characters are in a comedy club having a discussion  
when they're finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line , "" and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outside ! "" 
you don't know what the joke was because you couldn't hear him during the entire scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context  
in this film , brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene  
i don't want to give them away , but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past  
john's purpose for staying with his mother is to learn , and we as the audience learn right along with him  
his mother is not the fascinating type to begin with , but as john spends more time with her , we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth "

the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters  
the most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence  
he is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out  
portman's queen amidala and mcgregor's obi-wan kenobi don't fare nearly so well  
amidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life )  
and obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he's nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn's batman  
however , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job  
he also absolutely nails alec guiness' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise  
in fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that's one of the problems with this film  
i would never call myself a "" star wars "" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america  
however , if you are the one person in america who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost  
for example , one of the film's main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine  
for those of you not recently steeped in "" star wars "" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader's master in "" return of the jedi "" and "" empire strikes back  "" 
so , obviously , his appearance in "" phantom menace "" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful  
a lot of the movie is like that  
r2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it's obvious that lucas is banking on the audience's pre-existing fondness for them    
because he doesn't do much to add to it in any way  
same goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn't look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy  
even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from "" empire strikes back "" ) , and alderaan ( leia's home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in "" star wars "" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing  
what's the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? 
the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty  
there's no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be  
another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film  
i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters  
and jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast  
unlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you'll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive "" teenage mutant ninja turtles  "" 
furthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot  
oddly , this isn't just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids  
well , he's done a good job  
the hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy  
that's not jake lloyd's fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him  
that's another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader  
warning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! 
in my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin's future evil in the film  
the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there's nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie  
he has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine "

1,"after watching "" rat race "" last week , i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that , when not laughing aloud , i had held a grin for virtually all of the film's 112 minutes  
saturday night , i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn't enjoy it as much the second time as the first  
 "" rat race "" is a great goofy delight , a dandy mix of energetic performances , inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness  
hands down , this is the most fun film of the summer  
the movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a '60s slapstick comedy , featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding around the screen  
then comes the setup  
donald sinclair ( john cleese ) , the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas , enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients  
to that end , he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines  
gathering together the lucky token holders , he explains , "" today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six  "" 
the competition is simple : each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city , n  m  , containing $2 million in cash  
there is a transmitter in every key , so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead  
the race has no rules ? whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money  
since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes , let's use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers  
decked out in flashy , trashy clothing and sporting big hair , vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby  
she finds that grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite , conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life  
thrown together , it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature  
owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr  ) is currently the most hated man in america  
an nfl referee , he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game  
after escaping from a vengeful cab driver , owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention  
mr  pollini ( rowan atkinson ) is a cheerful , odd little italian man on holiday in america  
he also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times  
pollini hitches a ride with zack ( wayne knight ) , a hyper-tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation  
randy pear ( jon lovitz ) promised his wife beverly ( kathy najimy ) and two kids a fun-filled vacation in las vegas  
fearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race , he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview  
beverly insists the family stay together , so they hop in the mini-van and tear off into the desert  
brothers duane ( seth green ) and blaine ( vince vieluf ) cody are young , crooked and stupid  
blaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self-done tongue piercing , and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him  
the boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal  
finally , nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) is a no-nonsense lawyer-in-training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet ( amy smart ) for the journey  
at first glance , they seem blandly wholesome , but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn ( dean cain ) and spies him swimming with another woman  
director jerry zucker ( "" airplane , "" "" ghost "" ) leaps from racer to racer , periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr  grisham ( dave thomas ) , his personality-impaired right hand man , continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers  
as with any zucker production , a few jokes fall flat , but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps  
high points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally , with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay-off  
had i been part of the filmmaking team , i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby's clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron  
it would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm-inducing hint of child molestation  
i also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence  
my god , do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing "" all star ? "" 
but enough carping  
 "" rat race "" is a riot , with terrific no-holds-barred performances from the diverse cast "

1,"it has happened again  
a movie that is well scripted , well acted , and well directed  
it is involving , suspenseful    
it even has an unexpected twist at the end that packs a punch like a blow to the solar plexus  
but in order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie  
the sixth sense is that movie  
starring bruce willis ( armageddon ) as a child psychologist and haley joel osment ( forrest gump ) as a troubled youngster , the sixth sense is more spooky than scary , though it does contain disturbing images designed to startle  
eight-year-old cole sear ( osment ) sees dead people  
not just in dreams  
and not just as lifeless bodies  
he sees them walking around like regular people  
and he sees them all the time  
dr  malcolm crowe ( willis ) is trying to help him  
he recognizes in cole many of the same attributes as one of his earlier patients whom crowe failed , resulting in that patient shooting crowe before turning the gun on himself  
if crowe could manage to find a way to help cole , he believes he just might be able to put his own demons to rest  
but first he needs to gain cole's trust  
the boy is so frightened by what he sees , he has closed himself off emotionally , being unwilling to tell anyone    
not crowe , not even his own mother ( toni collette , clockwatchers )    
about his "" secrets  "" 
crowe begins to spend more and more time with him , even as his own marriage starts to dissolve around him , his wife anna ( olivia williams , rushmore ) becoming cold and distant because of his neglect of her and his preoccupation with the boy  
bruce willis underplays his role , allowing the excellent script to do most of the work of building character development  
crowe moves from treating a troubled boy who won't communicate , to treating a troubled boy who is having hallucinations , to wondering if perhaps there isn't some truth behind what the boy sees  
mr  willis does a serviceable job , letting the focus remain on the story instead of on his familiar action hero screen persona  
eleven-year-old haley joel osment manages to impress us with his performance  
he demonstrates an amazing amount of self-composure as well as an ability to play nuances in a complex character as if he were a seasoned pro  
it is fine work for one of such a tender age  
keep your eye on this young man  
the supporting cast is also quite effective  
toni collette , as the confused , frightened , and frustrated mother who can't understand what is happening to her child ; olivia williams , as crowe's once loving wife who is shutting down emotionally due to the lack of attention from her husband ; and donnie wahlberg ( ransom ) as crowe's ex-patient , now grown , who illustrates his doctor's failure to help him in the most vivid terms imaginable  
twenty-eight year old m  night shyamalan ( wide awake ) directed his own script , maintaining a proper tension throughout the film and crafting the storytelling so expertly that the film's full impact is not reached until its final moments , when a surprising revelation forces a reevaluation of all that preceded it  
it is a rare movie which manages to pull that off and mr  shyamalan , as the one responsible , is certainly to be commended  
in giving the sixth sense a favorable "" three star "" review for its craftsmanship and artistic merit , i must also point out that , spiritually speaking , the film is highly misleading  
there is no scriptural foundation upon which to base a belief in ghosts or the "" living dead "
1,"with the success of the surprise hit alien , directed by ridley scott , a sequel was inevitable  
in fact , after watching the first film , a sequel was wanted , particularly by this reviewer  
handing over the director's chair to recent box office gem james cameron , who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii , a surprisingly dull film , and terminator , making cameron a household name ) , the alien series got a face-lift of immense proportions  
instead of being a suspense/science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture  
what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created  
a film like aliens comes along only once in a while , and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it  
i never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have  
the terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear  
aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen  
with a science fiction plot , cameron gives aliens added testosterone , pumping up the action and fire power from the original film  
in fact , aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original  
perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero--or heroine , as the case may be  
never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film , and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character  
sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about  
placing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual , but because of weaver's presence , a woman is the only suitable hero  
aliens begins 57 years after alien ended  
lieutenant ellen ripley ( weaver ) is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened  
she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens , but "" the company "" is doubtful  
they explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left  
despite stern warnings from ripley , the company remains rigid and won't call the families back  
however , when the company loses contact with the colony , ripley's story seems much more feasible  
one of the company's directors , carter burke ( paul reiser ) , wants to gather a team to travel to the planet  
this team includes a buff private vasquez ( jenette goldstein ) , a questionable corporal hicks ( michael biehn ) , and a loyal android bishop ( lance henriksen )  
burke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony  
arriving on the planet , the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon-type environment  
the only survivor is 12 year old rebecca "" newt "" jorden ( carrie henn )  
ripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become , and she becomes newt's surrogate mother  
ripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened , and soon , all hell breaks loose  
aliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott's version , it also multiplies the number of aliens in general  
alien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member , except ripley , who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo  
aliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens , and as a result , the chills are incredibly heightened  
then again , this is james cameron , the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2 : judgment day  
he is the best action director out there ( topping renny harlin , who directed cliffhanger ) , and only he could create something as terrifying as this film  
it seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes , and aliens has the motherload  
with perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film , aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion  
i can't recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout , never dropping for a moment  
just when you think the movie is over , something else will occur , and it starts right back up again  
with a seemingly endless conclusion , aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history  
this scene is usually the one remembered most from the film , as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen  
using flawless special effects , the climax is exhausting , leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety  
of course , for a film of this genre to work properly , the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see  
aliens is completely realistic , even a decade after its initial release  
the special effects are wonderfully seamless , with a terrifying alien to go with them "

1,"when andy leaves for cowboy camp , his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys  
one of these toys is wheezy , a penguin with a broken squeaker  
woody ( tom hanks ) saddles up andy's dog and rides out into the yard to rescue wheezy  
woody succeeds in his mission , but doesn't make it back to the house before al , the unscrupulous owner of al's toy barn , recognizes woody as a rare collector's item and steals him  
buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) leads hamm ( john ratzenberger ) , mr  potato head ( don rickles ) , slinky dog ( jim varney ) , and rex ( wallace shawn ) into the city to find their friend  
meanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped  
al has collected every piece of merchandising from the 1950's tv puppet show "" woody's round-up "" except for a woody doll  
now that the collection is complete , al plans to sell woody and his round-up gang-bullseye the horse , jessie the cowgirl ( joan cusack ) , and stinky pete the old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) -to a toy museum in japan  
the gang is happy about the move ; they've been in storage for years waiting for woody  
if woody doesn't go with them , they'll be closed up in a dark box again , possibly forever  
trying to convince him to stay with them , jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up , and woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered  
while woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy , buzz and the boys invade al's toy barn , where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesn't know he's a toy  
the new buzz generates the movie's biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on "" zurg's fortress "" ( i  e  , al's apartment building )  
the original "" toy story "" won me over because its central themes reflected a grown-up sensibility rather than the usual this-is-what-we-think-kids-want-to-hear  
while most kids' movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill , in "" toy story "" buzz discovered that he wasn't special , that he was just like everyone else  
buzz sank into a suicidal depression , but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy  
in other words , it's okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life  
most of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that we're not space rangers and we're never going to be  
 "" toy story 2 "" addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie  
woody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded , abandoned , or sealed up in a dark box in the attic  
this is another big grown-up theme : everything ends  
the theme is introduced early in the movie when woody's arm is torn and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp  
on the shelf , woody meets wheezy , who's dusty , broken , and forgotten  
the other toys are shocked that woody has been "" shelved , "" and they worry that woody's ride out to the 25-cent box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt  
after he's stolen , woody has to decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with andy and his pals  
of course , in spite of the heavy themes "" toy story 2 "" explores , it's also very funny  
most of the laughs come from the toys' assault on al's toy barn and on the apartment building  
the brief substitution of a new , still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise ; i'd wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original  
most of the vocal performances are first-rate  
tom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work  
however , one voice-over also stands out as horribly miscast  
kelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector  
although he does a lot of voice-over work in commercials and on "" the simpsons "" ( as sideshow bob ) , grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice  
he doesn't have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete  
the animation is even better than in the first  
especially impressive were the textures of the figures  
we can now see the difference between flesh and plastic ; in the first movie the people looked just like the toys , but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint  
we can also see that bo peep is porcelain  
as you can tell from the long-winded phrasing common in the merchandising -- "" disney and pixar's 'toy story 2' "" -- this is pixar's coming out party  
to celebrate they appended their first project , a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball , to the beginning of the movie "
1,"as i write the review for the new hanks/ryan romantic comedy you've got mail , i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet  
i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world's biggest paid commercial for america online  
and i wonder : is that so bad ? 
well , the commercial part is  
as for the movie , well , as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan , i think i'll be okay  
to paraphrase james berardinelli , whose reviews i admire very much , tom hanks and meg ryan can act  
they are both wonderful , but for all of hanks' glorious work in serious films , such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan , and his glorious triumph in philadelphia , i like him best when he's suitably obnoxious  
tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he's going to get the girl : the only question is how ? 
meg ryan , america's high school sweetheart , can act  
she's had a handful of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don't , get the movie-- fantastic )  
but , i like her best when she's , well , perky  
she is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks , they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime  
some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don't really know  
all i know is that i just like them both  
they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that's really hard to resist , and i'm not going to even try  
they're just really , really cute , sweet , and charming  
hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron , who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle  
here , the setup is a little different  
kathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children's bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her  
she is successful , beautiful , and dates a well-known columnist with very radical idea ( kinnear )  
she is also having an affair , of sorts  
you see , kathleen , with the handle shopgirl , is secretly emailing ny152  
they have a strictly un-detailed relationship : there are no specifics , and they have no idea who each other is  
ny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) , a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega-bookstores , run by his father ( coleman )  
fox books has decided to open a store on the west side , right across from a little children's bookseller named "" shop around the corner "" , run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly  
every morning , these two email each other silly , and every day , they fight "" to the death ! ! ""  
it's a charming premise , and one that works nicely , balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have  
it also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no "" let's have sex tonight "" mantra , if you'll excuse my bluntness  
this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love  
hmm  well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan "" hook up "" , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness  
you know it's going to happen , the question is now ? 
thankfully , ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two sweet kids  
it's all cute and wonderful , and for all of the idealism , it makes me feel good  
hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is  
he is , i believe , america's greatest actor  
does he show it here ? 
nah  
but he's still tom hanks , and she's still meg ryan  
which is what this movie boils down to  
it's pure confection  
all the bits about the godfather , the jokes , the superb script , it's all really sweet  
there are some immense flaws , like pacing  
the last third of the movie really doesn't work as well as i would have liked , and for a romantic comedy , it's slow  
once hanks knows the secret , it gets really slow  
i even looked at my watch a couple times , to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for , so that i could get home at a reasonable hour  
the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated "

1,"seen at the 21st portland international film festival 
film title : supermarket woman director : juzo itami country : japan 1997 cinematography : yonezo maeda music : toshiyuki honda cast : nobuko miyamoto , masahitko tsugawa , shiro ito , yuji miyake , akiko matsumoto super features : typical itami film    
funny and pointed in its own way  
if you don't care how and what the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket , then this film is not for you     
maybe it is better to ignore it , as this strong and biting satire , as only juzo itami can deliver , will give you an insight as to what some foods go through  
having , in the past , made films that pulled every punch imaginable , from the family traditions ( the funeral ) , to taxes ( a taxing woman & a taxing woman returns ) , to the diabolical gangsters ( minbo ) , to hospitals ( the seriously ill ) , juzo itami , this time takes on the supermarkets' own war , to get the consumers  
and while this film has its funny side , in the crazy situations that it creates , it also shows another side , which is very much the attitude of a corporate structure that is more concerned with its profits than it is with any customer  
goro has a supermarket  
and a competitor comes into the neighborhood , trying to take him out of business by providing less expensive prices for everything that is sold in the supermarket  
bargains galore , its name , has in mind the closure of goro's humbler venue , so that in the end it can mark up its prices in any way it can  
goro hires hanako , a housewife whose talents seem to be better suited to management , than they are in anything else  
hanako , as she gets familiar with the operation , discovers many of the tricks of the trade , done by many of the elders in charge of each section of the market  
and the procedures , are not always "" fresh "" food , but a new packaging and a new date , to try and convince the customers that quality is on the shelves  
hanako's ideas take hold , starting with a few of the women that work in the supermarket , being that they do not even shop there at all  
and hanako discovers along the way that a few giveaways here and there make a bit of a difference  
if not cause some serious problems in the running of the store  
a price error , forces them to give away eggs for very low prices , and causes the store a few hassles , but , it brought the people in , and everyone knows that these customers will buy a few other things  
as the operation gets stronger , the competition also has trickery up its sleeve , and it has been undermining much of the operation by paybacks to one of the store managers , as well as the meat and fish elder supervisors  
eventually these people are found out , and hanako has to tread slowly and carefully , until in the end they all have a showdown  
and here , the truth and honesty win out , and even one of the elders decides to stay rather than go to work for the corrupt opponent  
in the process , they also find that "" freshness "" ( with some very funny jokes on this word as well ) becomes a much more important tool than they imagined  
with some very nice performances , in this hectic , and fast paced film , this film gives us a sitting of two hours that is satisfying in many ways , although a failed love story between goro and hanako does not come off much , even though towards the end it is suggested  
but this would take away from the satire and its strengths  
with food gags all over the place , the film lets you have it  
and what fun it is  
worth seeing  
 ( editorial ) the director of this film , juzo itami , died shortly after the film was finished , and he left behind a legacy of comedy and satire that is rare , and uncompromising  
we would wish that he had been able to make one about film making , of which he must have had a few stories to tell , but we will have to do with much of the japanese society , and its many errant ways     
not to say that these things do not happen anywhere else     
america is no less guilty of any of these subjects at all , should anyone have the guts to tackle it    
we could learn something along the way , too "

1,"i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files  
first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie  
the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable  
you have to reach for a larger audience  
therefore , the movie is quite user-friendly  
altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange  
but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on  
you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera  
in any case , the answer is no  
i am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium  
however , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie  
i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new  
everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others  
i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie  
warning : major spoilers follow ! 
please do not read to fully enjoy this movie , you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird "" hummm "" sound is all about  
you have been warned  
the x-files is what a summer should be  
exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances  
this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank  
from start to finish , this movie does not let go of you  
when i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon  
this flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes  
in fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue  
you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! 
the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid  
you know , when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? 
so yeah , the x-files is scary  
and guess what ? 
you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster  
do not think that the x-files is a monster movie  
in fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total  
no , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series  
scully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time  
she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much  
no , this is mulder's time in the spotlight  
by now , you have heard of the scene where mulder "" showers "" independence day  
if you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let's just say that due to recent events mulder should be "" showering "" godzilla instead  
to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there    who 
cares ! ? 
if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? 
the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous  
the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill  
the script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose  
if you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! 
unlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects  
miss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense  
also , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies "

1,"in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because , in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen-style , earnestly shallow gen-x angst pictures , it seemed to be actually about something  
it angered people , started arguments outside the theater , riled things up  
it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film  
having endured my share of the hype , i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside , and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about  
does men live up to its press ? 
well , yes it does  
and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office  
for the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment  
chad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business  
chad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder  
howard is chad's boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent  
we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge  
there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her  
the reason ? 
both men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex  
 "" it'll restore a little dignity to our lives , "" he says  
howard , helpless against the force of chad's will , agrees to the plan  
they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp  
chad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner  
howard follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham-handed and desperate  
flattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both  
you can guess which one she falls for  
soon a tragic lovers' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she's handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him  
adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ? 
in chad , writer/director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film-hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls  
his evil is as subtle as a viper's , and as easy as his smile  
we watch in stunned disbelief as he back-stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine's heart  
his character would be a joke if he wasn't so chillingly real- all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him  
he's the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness  
if one of his co-workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind  
politics is his game , and the modern cubicle-filled office is his playground  
men wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory  
the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won't describe  
the scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril  
could it happen in the real world ? 
probably not  
taken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society  
maybe it's just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience  
the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism- only the strong will survive  
the marvel of labute's multi-layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way  
but does the film work as entertainment ? 
its darned funny in spots , particularly in the men's room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions  
it works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers  
stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her  
likewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions  
by the end of the film you'll feel as if you've met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film  
certainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed  
but the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time "

1,"in 1987 the stock market crashed , and oliver stone's wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses  
wall street lucked out in its timing ; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had , and though its kill-or-be-killed approach to business was exaggerated , that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan-era businessman  
stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs  evil tale relayed in the fast-paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange  
critics and audiences lauded wall street , elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic  
i'm proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them  
i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone's output with its thin caricatures , obvious sentiments , and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen  
stone goes for broke in every scene ( the same could be said for nearly all of his works )  
this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions  
he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane  
it's all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity , rather than explore what these situations are really like  
i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative ( as they are presented in boiler room ) rather than laughably over the top  
these guys are salesmen after all , not televised judges  
more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street  
the only possible solution i can muster is its release date  
and not just the timeliness of the "" greed is good "" subject matter : the film was plumped down in the eighties , a decade in which the one-joke comedy rose to an art form , and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept , low result movies  
in my mind , the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies , but bad music , bad hair , and bad clothes  
maybe stone's after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace  
boiler room is an equally well-timed film with some similarities to stone's piece of crap  
they both feature a consequential father-son relationship , though boiler room's is much more subtle and touching  
and they are both concerned with the power of greed , yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery-smooth , heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street  
boiler room is a message movie as well , though ( at least until the end ) doesn't shove it in our faces  
boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash  
as i said , this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day ( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn't been seen in quite a while ) ; not only do we want to be millionaires , we want to watch other people become millionaires ! 
in our super-judgmental , power-oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything ; when you have money , you have it "" all ""  
and seth ( giovanni ribisi ) wants it "" all "" the easy way  
he's a well-intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm ( the kind that sells junk stock ) whereupon he meets others just like him  
ben affleck is cast as jim , the company headhunter , who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko  
his job is to influence trainee's into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood  
it's ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b  s that they're told to dish out to prospective buyers  
affleck's character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin's similar character in glengary glen ross , and that proves detrimental to the actor's performance  
affleck shouts , curses and be-littles his rookie employees just like baldwin , minus the edge  
when alec played the scene he became the part , spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own  
by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading  
the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks : they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game  
rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are : intellectual gangsters  
they aren't above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes  
we drink up this world along with seth , and watch him become seduced by it , just like we might be  
as in all cautionary tales , boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing , then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness  
i know this story  
we all do  
but it can work if it's told with intelligence and energy , and that is how writer \ director ben younger tells it  
as a director of ( please excuse my french ) mise-en-scene younger has much to learn "

1,"when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time  
while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good  
i'm happy to say that there's something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs  
in fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours  
the film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island  
ted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can't seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w  
earl brown ) , who's being harassed by one of the school jocks  
it seems warren's sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted's willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up  
mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom  
ted was just flattered that she even knew his name  
unfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital  
fast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn't seen since that fateful day  
with the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love  
however , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections  
there's something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin  
not exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them  
with their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you'll not only enjoy , but also won't mind talking about the next day at the water cooler  
the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers' last two films ) they almost all work  
i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on  
one minute you'll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you'll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary's apartment  
one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller  
he is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he's a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation  
ted's a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don't always work out  
it's comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top  
actually , i've liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties  
the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money  
in it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big-time bowling hustler  
it was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short-lived "" the ben stiller show "" on the fox network in late '92/early '93  
like "" the critic "" ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show's cancellation  
cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times  
however , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she's got guys just falling over each other to be with her  
heck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week  
my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn't change , and you know , it's really true  
he and ralph macchio must hang out or something  
maybe they live in dick clark's pool house  
anyway , here's another good piece of casting , as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary's heart  
the supporting performances are also good  
chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy  
lin shae , who plays mary's neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji-like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film  
lee evans , as mary's friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist  
the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j  strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren't any noticeable times where the film drags  
the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes "

1,"logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility  
considering that the skeptic's best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities , writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task  
occasionally , we get a film that does manage it  
terry gilliam's "" 12 monkeys "" was one such film  
but more frequently , we get films that don't much deal with it at all  
there is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ? 
the "" terminator "" films made up for them with exciting action , "" back to the future "" did it with an entertaining story , and the new film "" frequency "" pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own  
is "" frequency "" filled with plot holes ? 
yes  
does it matter ? 
not really  
the film opens in october of 1969  
firefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson )  
the double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective  
a strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in '69 and that john has found in the present day  
though both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom  
now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women  
frank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past  
the premise of "" frequency "" is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions  
this isn't explained ; you just have to go with it  
when frank doesn't die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way  
the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other  
sometimes frank's changing the past results in something happening right away in john's world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time  
now , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer's murders was because the change had already happened in frank's world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren't really the point  
when "" frequency "" gets cooking , it's a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing  
what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and "" frequency "" works as long as it keeps moving  
the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion  
director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure "" frequency "" as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved  
i liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward  
it actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john's advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him  
 ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself  ) 
i even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods  
some may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let's face it : it's a darn cool way to end the film  
there are enough surprises and plot twists in "" frequency "" to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant  
the other major thing to appreciate about "" frequency "" is the handling of the father-son relationship  
quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it's a rock-solid job from both actors  
the relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ? 
watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question  
the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don't believe in the characters , we don't care about the outcome of the thriller plot  
here , we do care , because we like the lead actors  
i also liked some of the supporting cast members  
elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably  
andre braugher , late of the television show "" homicide : life on the street , "" gives a nice supporting turn as frank's best friend and future colleague of john  
he has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank's world series predictions come true before his very eyes  
braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused  
perhaps the only thing i didn't like about "" frequency "" is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera's focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard  
but that's only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics "

1,"robocop is an intelligent science fiction thriller and social satire , one with class and style  
the film , set in old detroit in the year 1991 , stars peter weller as murphy , a lieutenant on the city's police force  
1991's detroit suffers from rampant crime and a police department run by a private contractor ( security concepts inc  ) whose employees ( the cops ) are threatening to strike  
to make matters worse , a savage group of cop-killers has been terrorizing the city  
on murphy's first day of duty , after his transfer from another precinct , these cop-killers brutally murder him by shooting off his limbs one by one  
 ( orion pictures had to edit this extremely graphic scene in order to get an r rating from the m  p  a  a  ) 
after the emergency room staff at the hospital cannot save murphy and declare him clinically dead , s  c  i  
recruits his remains for their new "" robocop "" program  
using the remains of murphy's body as a foundation , their scientists build a cyborg , made of both flesh and metal  
the cyborg ( robocop ) is half human ( murphy ) and half robot ; the s  c  i  
engineers have erased murphy's memory and replaced it with a computer program ( or so they think )  
with his lightning quick reflexes , immense strength , and impenetrable armor , s  c  i  
envisions robocop as an indestructible super-cop : the solution to detroit's problems  
the remainder of the plot follows robocop's crime-foiling and vengeance on his murderers  
as a science fiction action-thriller , robocop is extremely effective  
dutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense , shocking gore , and spectacular special effects  
several sequences in the film , such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist , are destined to become cult-classics  
because robocop is so visually and emotionally rousing , it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audience--in other words , in a movie theater  
although the special effects and action are exciting , they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre  
rather , robocop stands out for its accurate and biting satire of american society  
the movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative , terrorism , board games , and television news broadcasts with air-headed anchors  
these news broadcasts , which are exceptionally clever , recur periodically throughout the movie and help to provide comic relief from the intense action and gore  
the satire in robocop , however , is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense and blood  
1990's america , as portrayed in the film , may seem far fetched but is in actuality ( i think ) only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society  
the humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible and absurd  
verhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining and enlightening piece of science fiction/social commentary  
unfortunately , robocop possesses several flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre  
the movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior , the terminator , and aliens  
robocop's main problem , aside from its dumb title , is that it does not sufficiently develop murphy's character  
we never learn the degree to which murphy ( as robocop ) is human and the degree to which he is a robot  
does murphy have any human spirit or free will left , or is he merely a computer following a program ? 
the script halfheartedly raises these issues but then abandons them in its climactic flurry of gory action  
moreover , it almost completely ignores the question ( and tragedy ) of denying a man his right to die in favor of turning him into a machine  
robocop also contains several bothersome loose-ends "

1," "" dangerous beauty "" is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583  
it is beautifully filmed , wonderfully acted , and certainly nothing short of entertaining , but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness  
dealing with themes of forbidden love , religious intolerance , subordination of women , sexual freedom , and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high-cultured society , it still feels like brightly lit fluff  
the director , marshall herskovitz , doesn't want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down , so he opts for a more genial , livelier , and relatively shallow interpretation  
the film takes place during the renaissance , a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe  
at this time , venice was its own republic , and it thrived on being the central juncture of east-west commerce  
the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice , so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived  
however , there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes , their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment  
the story centers on veronica franco ( catherine mccormack ) , a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier ( rufus sewell ) , the son of wealthy aristocratic parents ( jeroen krabb ? and joanna cassidy )  
unfortunately , the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love -- rather , it was more like a business transaction , where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power , wealth , and ensure that outsiders couldn't get in  
veronica , despite her charm and good looks , is certainly an outsider  
after a short love affair , marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her  
however , because she is beautiful and intelligent , veronica has a chance to enter marco's world , albeit not as his wife  
she decides to become a courtesan -- a class of women who were as well-educated as they were ravishing , and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite  
a courtesan was not a mere prostitute ; they were afforded a special place in society , and they were greatly revered , respected , and often envied  
at one point , a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants  
veronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother , paola ( jacqueline bisset ) , who was once a famed courtesan herself  
once she enters the lifestyle , veronica finds that it suits her quite well  
she is allowed to read all the books she wants , she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry , and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet , including the awestruck marco  
their relationship develops into a playful bantering , with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marco's advances  
in many ways , their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love , and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love  
 "" love the love , not the man , "" as her mother told her  
 "" dangerous beauty , "" which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal , flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice  
it has multiple plot lines -- including veronica's adversarial relationship with a court poet ( oliver platt ) , her role in obtaining france's military assistance in venice's battle against the turks , and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition -- yet it is never confusing or overbearing  
much of the film's success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role  
known chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson's ire in "" braveheart "" ( 1995 ) , mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady  
she has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan ; her character is intelligent , witty , and both sensual and vulnerable , all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes  
the rest of the roles are also filled well , including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in "" dark city "" have assured him a solid place in hollywood  
he has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta , and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas  
oliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin , although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy  
platt is a good actor , but he's just too hard to hate  
jacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was , and even fred ward turns up in a small , but moving performance as marco's uncle  
 "" dangerous beauty "" is marshall herskovitz's sophomore directorial effort , after the overlooked 1993 film "" jack the bear  "" 
partnered with edward zwick , herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television ( "" thirtysomething , "" "" my so-called life "" ) and in the movies ( "" legends of the fall "" )  
his directing style can be best described as transparent -- it never gets in the way of the story , yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions  
he could have approached the film in any number of ways , including overdosing on the sexual aspect , which he wisely avoids  
 "" dangerous beauty "" contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic , but not so much that it seems exploitative  
herskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew , including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli , whose previous efforts include the highly-stylized thriller "" kalifornia "" ( 1993 ) and abel ferrara's dark sci-fi film "" body snatchers "" ( 1994 )  
bazelli captures the film in strong , bold colors , and be brings sixteenth-century venice to life in wide , panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery  
however , the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood ( "" brazil , "" "" the princess bride "" ) and the costumes by gabriella pescucci ( "" the age of innocence "" )  
the only problem with "" dangerous beauty "" is that it doesn't stick with you  
it's a good story well-told with interesting characters , but it's easy to shrug off once you've left the theater  
the only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions , but it never quite comes off because it's simply too melodramatic and conventional "

1,"seen april 16 , 1999 at 10 p  m  at crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n  y  ) , theater #15 , by myself for free using my hoyts' critic's pass  
[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good seats , sound and picture] 
do you realize that every time you encounter a new person you've just become part of a story ? 
everyone has their own life story , both past and present , and every time two or more interact , they become part of each others' story ( not necessarily an important or even significant part , but a part nevertheless )  
that seems to be the basic theory behind `go , ' where several characters' chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways  
in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn't usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them , such as a teenage supermarket cashier , a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors  
these types of characters might not sound all that original , but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father , a mid-level drug dealer , a narc obsessed with multi-level-marketing , horny wedding guests , a zen lovemaker , two shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out  
how they will all come together is the process the film deals with  
i'd imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators' testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general  
the film starts out as anything else , with little indication of what's to come  
we meet ronna ( polley ) , a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn't seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent  
she's not very charming , especially to her customers , but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works  
maybe this is because she's not a very afeminite character , but she's far from masculine - a creative character indeed  
things start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy , hyperactive , yet likable simon ( askew ) , an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences  
this agreement starts a three-pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug  
the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death  
nearly the same can be said for two other characters , zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) , who we don't think much of when they first appear as supporting characters , but later will become major players to the film's makeup - another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be  
once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle  
when the title screen `ronna' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene , it's clear this film isn't going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling  
considering how good it is up until that point , it's a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today  
and so the film begins to take shape , first by following ronna and her friends on a one-night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam ( who were actually looking for simon ) , which doesn't exactly go as planned , but that's what keeps it all so interesting  
the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna's story , but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead  
simon and his three friends head to ? vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined  
the third arc , about zack and adam , again overlaps with ronna's story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle  
we're shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna  
and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren't even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when they were  
i'd really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end , but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven't seen the film  
perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability , and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay , just through great filmmaking  
still , i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well : 
 ? direction : trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman , it's a great accomplishment  
he doesn't just depict a story , he wraps us up in it all , pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low  
 ? screenplay : besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general , it's clear the script has been inspired by many sources , with both obvious and subtle references , yet it never screams `rip-off  ' 
 ? tone/mood : where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream , this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre  
it's not overly-dark or twisted and the comedy isn't so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy , more like `macabre light  ' 
 ? cinematography/art direction : able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner  
 ? characterization : for nearly every character introduced , no matter what role they play in the big picture , we're able to get a sense of who they are , what they're thinking and how they came to be in their situations  
even when their actions are surprising , it never seems very out of synch  
 ? performances : every actor nails their role ( see above )  
 ? theme/theory : the film doesn't seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social messages , instead , it's more of a philosophical experiment  
in fact , it might not have meant to do that intentionally , but there definitely is something existential to it all

1,"let me open this one with a confession : i love cop movies  
i adore them with such an unwavering , near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998's one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers , steven  
was it any good ? 
well , just about as good as baldwin's steven seagal impression ( for those i've confused the answer is a resounding no ! )  
now let me clarify , i don't love just any cop movie ; i'm not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80's and now slowly ( gulp ) returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker  
i'm partial to those gritty , earthy cop dramas like serpico , donnie brasco , and the french connection  
problem is these films come along just about as often as george w  bush makes a cogent point so whenever a "" true "" cop movie does hit multiplexes , i come running towards it like an eager puppy ? ? ? and inevitably i leave , head bowed , tripping over my squiggly tail  
so what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $7  50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin-off , no ? ) ? 
truth is i'm a sucker for those barren streets , that gritty , graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops , like modern day knights , must shield us from their iniquitous clutches  
yes it's all very corny and awfully boys clubish , which , i'm guessing , is precisely where these feelings come from  
as little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe's , enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies , etc  the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies , and heighten them , turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos  
as an adult my tastes haven't changed all that drastically ; sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film , but i still delight at the promise a "" guy "" film could potentially bring  
now what if it's the cops who're the corrupt ones ? 
ooh that one really gets me going , these protectors using all that at their service , taking advantage of others for their own gain  
throw a courtroom drama ( yech ! ) 
into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city  
how absorbing is prince of the city , you ask ? 
so damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved  
the film stars treat williams , who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at  
since i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn't  
 ( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves )  
like mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn't make it to where he should have  
 ( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell )  
here , the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino's in serpico ( also directed by lumet )  
williams plays danny ciello , a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre-juliani streets of new york  
they work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes  
and that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done  
the squad relies entirely on informants ( low level junkies ) to gain access to the big wigs , and in order to obtain the info they seek , they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice  
danny has done this , and though he's a fairly honorable guy , who took the job in order to do good , his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way  
he seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a "" double agent ""  
he does so with one condition : he will not rat on his partners  
right away we know that that is exactly what he'll have to do  
and watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be  
undercover cop films are almost innately exciting , even the kind that pull out all the cliches ( like in too deep )  
how can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal , ambiguity , and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position ? 
prince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive , hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet , as well as a handful of intense performances , most notably by treat  
lumet's greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back , and lets the camera soak up the action  
his scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension , and he rarely holds for reaction shots , instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking  
lumet's worst tendency is one that many film makers ( especially oliver stone ) tend to overuse : he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension  
this isn't as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan , lumet's most recent cop \ lawyer endeavor , a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching  
though of late lumet has made several really awful career choices ( maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something ) , the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria , here he was on , sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot  
some of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic  
hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable  
of course cop movies aren't popular anymore ( yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines ) , but just look at the average hollywood action movies , flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn't gay , the lame comic relief character who's never funny , and on and on  
for all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop \ courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills  
it focuses completely on its story , and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies "

1,"wow ! what a movie  
it's everything a movie can be : funny , dramatic , interesting , weird , funny , weird and strikingly original  
yep that pretty much describes this movie  
it starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one of the weirdest , funniest most original movies i have ever seen  
it boggles the mind and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies like this more often  
besides being one of the best films of the year , being john malkovich may as well be one of the best movies ever  
period  
then again there are so many good movies , that one cannot pick an all time favorite  
john cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man out of a job , in search of a job  
his wife lotte schwartz who is played by a completely un-noticeable cameron diaz who looks like something off the streets is an animal lover and has about every kind of animal you could think of  
craig finds a job as a file at the 7 ? floor of a business building    you 
have to pry open the elevator doors open before it reaches floor eight , the 7 ? floor is just a floor between 7 and 8  
he is hired by his 105 year old boss ( orsen bean ) to be a filer  
in his office , he discovers a little door , to which was boarded up and hidden  
to his curiosity he opens it and starts to crawl toward it , he then gets sucked to the end and ends up in john malkovich's mind  
fifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike  
he returns to tell his co-worker maxine ( catherine keener ) that he has found a portal that will lead him into john malkovich's mind , she doesn't believe him but after she sees it it changes her mind  
lotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that being someone else is good after all  
john malkovich of course has no idea what is going on , and by the end of this bizarre film there are so many twists and turns , that we don't know what really happened  
john cusack is outstanding and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play  
he fits the role perfectly and to me was brilliantly cast  
cameron diaz is outstanding and utterly one of the world's most prettiest women , is made up here unnoticeable and very unattractive  
she however gives a very comic performance and this could easily be her best role to date  
catherine keener is very funny and sexy as maxine and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant and this movie plays big time homage ? to the master himself  
the whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart and clever  
spike jonze ( three kings ) makes his fabulous directing debut , and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film  
he lets the viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie  
by the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was  
the screenplay written by charlie kaufman was hilarious and often thought-provoking  
the film also had a soft side to it and even though the ending is very surprising it is also a little sad and heart-warming  
the whole movie was fantastic and had me rolling in the isles  
from cameron diaz's appearence to john malkovich's explorations i laughed very hard , and it may as well be as funny as as good as it gets ( the funniest ! )  
there isn't a slow point in the movie , or an overused idea  
there are no cliches except for the fact that this is the most original , inventie , witty , and smart movie i've seen in a long time  
i found myself amazed by everything : the direction , acting , writing and the whole idea of the movie  
by the end i had to wonder why hollywood doesn't want to make movies like this anymore  
or why they don't  
all filmmakers watch this movie and get some ideas of movies to come out  
this was a surprise hit as was american beauty  
'being john malkovich' is in the top 5 movies of the year , and in the top 10 best films ever made  
it has something that no other movies playing now has "

1,"what's shocking about "" carlito's way "" is how good it is  
having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino's previous film , "" scent of a woman , "" and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one ( he had just won an oscar ) , "" carlito's way "" was destined for underrated heaven  
that's what it is : an underrated gem of a movie  
and what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it , and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study  
 "" carlito's way "" deals with , well , carlito brigante ( pacino ) , a puerto rican ex-drug kingpin , who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke-addicted , curly-haired lawyer ( sean penn ) points out a legal technicality  
of course , carlito was actually awoken in prison , and has decided to go straight , even if he's really a crook at heart  
carlito , like barry lyndon , is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn , and can't escape into something he is not  
carlito's attempts at a clean , legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn  
when he first gets out , a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot-out , where he has to kill a couple people to survive  
he's constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he's doing anything illegal , and his lawyer finds himself neck-deep in a pile of shit , needing him to try and help him out , which includes him doing some prison breaking  
carlito , like ratso rizzo , wants to go to miami ( since , according to film logic , that's where it's at ) , but needs some funding  
being a legend , he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club ( this is the 70s , by the way , and since some of this takes place in night clubs , we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics , including several k  c  
and the sunshine band tunes - my personal favorite )  
he gets a bodyguard ( the great luis guzman , at his best ) , and is soon running a pretty good business , even if he's constantly attracting underworld young thugs , like benny blanco "" from the bronx "" ( john leguiziamo ) , who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito  
on the other side , the symbol of promise and hope , is gail ( penelope ann miller - what happened to her ? ) , his girlfriend from before prison  
she's a goregeous ballerina , and a stripper , and soon carlito is trying to get back with her , and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami  
while this relationship is never fully defined or anything , we get a sense of love between them , and they have some truly interesting scenes between them ( she never gives him addresses or locales - he always has to track her down )  
all of these elements clash together at the end , in a brilliantly executed , emotional climax , which is inevitable  
when i say inevitable , i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack , putting a great spin on it  
sure , it's going to eleveate some of the tension , but it gives the film a lot of depth , as carlito is seen trapped by fate  
what's amazing is the big chase sequence ( amazingly done by de palma ) has a lot of tension and thrills  
like "" apollo 13 , "" we know what's going to happen , but we're still thrilled by what happens in the middle  
it's also very emotional , thanks to a great script by david koepp , and amazing performances by pacino and miller  
de palma is famous ( or infamous ) for lots of violence in his films  
his earlier flim , "" scarface "" ( which starred pacino in the lead ) , has a ton of it , especially at the end ( and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i'm still not over )  
but de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes  
to me , the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building , looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet  
this is the most brilliantly done , and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film , and probably the best in de palma film history  
with a gorgeous soprano duet in the background , and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito's head , and a saddened , remorseful look on pacino's face , it's a tear-jerker ( well , for me , i dunno about you    )  
the acting from all is great , especially from the three leads  
pacino was panned for his performance , chiefly because his accent wasn't puerto rican enough and , well , it wasn't as "" strong "" as his oscar-winning role in "" scent of a woman  "" 
well , his "" scent of a woman "" performance was great and all , but it was nothing really but , as comic kevin pollack said , a "" foghorn leghorn impression  "" 
in "" carlito's way , "" he's emotional , and strong , despite the fact that he's remorseful over his entire lifestyle , which he cannot change  
i felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tango-dancing , insult-throwing blind guy in "" scent of a woman  "" 
as i said , penelope ann miller is great , and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry  
and they're scenes are well-written , with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship  
and sean penn is amazing as the coke-addicted rat attorney  
every scene he's in , he has great energy , and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino  
in smaller roles , john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great "

1,"i know that "" funnest "" isn't a word  
 "" fun "" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective  
but that's the word that came to me right after viewing "" chicken run  "" 
no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like "" that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! "" 
so to hell with webster's -- "" chicken run "" is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while  
i can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner  
the chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something  
living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box  
one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer  
rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs  tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan  
she orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , "" chickens go in ; pies come out  "" 
what sort of pies ? 
chicken pies , of course  
co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : "" creature comforts , "" "" the wrong trousers , "" and "" a close shave  "" 
the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures  
part of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new  
 "" the wrong trousers , "" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and "" a close shave "" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories  
but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived  
now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in "" chicken run  "" 
the plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement  
thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done  
part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? 
park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is  
but they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us  
another thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing  
there are references to "" the great escape , "" obviously , and "" stalag 17  "" 
the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both "" raiders of the lost ark "" and "" indiana jones and the temple of doom  "" 
there's even a nod to "" the blues brothers , "" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history  
the "" braveheart "" reference is a hoot if you catch it  
when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , "" chicken run "" is downright brilliant in its execution  
consider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of "" blair witch project "" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online  
out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome  
why ? 
because once you got past the thought that "" they're parodying that 'blair witch' movie , "" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose  
they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing  
conversely , "" chicken run "" doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene  
if you've never seen "" indiana jones , "" the chase sequence is still fun  
even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character  
park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , "" chicken run "" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either  
enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , "" chicken run "" is that much richer  
the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them  
ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on "" absolutely fabulous "" ) nails it  
she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer  
the characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived , but sweet  
poor mr  tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help "

1,"a couple of months ago , when i first downloaded the face/off trailer from the net , my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold 'yawn'  
followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key , not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss-poor trailer  
then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u  s      unique    excellent     must-see  
well , i thought still skeptical , i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here  
'here' , of course , was still three months away  
i'll admit , when i trotted off to see this film , the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow  
i'd heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled , but his films were definitely not on my must-see list  
that , let me tell you , has changed completely  
i knew this fact only five minutes into the film , after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet  
the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick  
seriously  
i've never been a big john travolta fan , but he , like cage , perfectly suited his role in the movie      sorry , 
make that 'roles' in the movie  
even travolta's great performance , however , paled in comparison to cage's character portrayals  
my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler's hideout  
half drugged out of his mind , he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his son's death from castor's perspective - "" doesn't it just break your heart  "" he mutters coldly  
now don't go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie - it's not  
that's what really makes this movie unique  
it's an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters      not a common mix at all  
suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though "

1,"i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live-action-disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins , separated at birth by divorcing parents , never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again  
and everyone should know how i feel about remakes , especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you're going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea )  
this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list , and was actually quite the opposite  
contemporary live-action-disney films are not one of my favorties , anyway : they're usually unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10  
this one , however , is shockingly not bad  
in fact , it's actually good  
not the original good , but what's great about it is that it doesn't necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining  
because it's cute and innocent fun  
because it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with  
because the lead star is immensely appealing  
because the parents are also immensely appealing  
and ( i'm repeating myself ) because it's cute and innocent fun  
there's nothing too risque about it , save the plot ( the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish , but that is precisely the point of the movie ) , and it's aimed directly at either kids , adults who want to remember the original , or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid  
i , personally , am somewhere between the second and third  
i can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn't so weird or diverse ( the names godard and kubrick weren't even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc's "" wonderful world of disney , "" where they'd show you a live-action and/or made-for-tv disney flick an hour per week  
i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films ( like "" lady and the tramp "" and "" pinnochio "" )  
and , most sadly , i remember every single christmas , without fail , there were a barage of children's animated half-hour shows , made exclusively for the christmas season , that i wouldn't dare missing  
i can even remember seeing the made-for-tv "" parent trap ii "" on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the original "" parent trap  "" 
it's more of a late childhood movie , because it deals with the issue of divorce , but it deals with it in a disney-ized version  
it's playful , and witty , and charming , and if i saw it for the first time right now , having never experienced that part of my childhood , i'd probably dismiss it  
i'd probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn't seen the original at such a perfect age  
watching it , i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film , and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly-perfect parents splitting up , and how it affected my adolescence  
and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke , and pointed out that even in the most fucked-up of situations , things could always work out if you , well , manipulate things a bit , at least for the better  
this new version did that for me , but it's also charming in its own way  
it has a new cast , a contemporary feel , and , for the first time in awhile for a live-action-disney flick , a tone that isn't corny or condescending , but just right  
the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way  
and for the first time since the original film , the kids actually know better than the foolish adults  
the story is basically classic by now , repeated almost as many times as kurosawa's "" the seven samurai "" : a pair of twins ( played here by lindsay lohan , just like they were played by hayley mills in the original ) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents  
one , annie , is sent to live with the mother ( natasha richardson , resembling her mother , vanessa redgrave , more than i had ever noticed ) in london , where she lives with her parents and her devoted , foppish butler ( simon kunz ) , as she works as a swingin' fashion designer  
she grows up refined and classy , but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker-playing  
the other , hallie , is sent to northern california with her father ( dennis quaid ) to live on a vineyard with their pseudo-maid ( lisa ann walter ) , and grows up rugged yet charming  
they both meet at the same camp , one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged  
they feud because they look all-too similar , and are thus in tight competition , which results in some nasty pranks , which winds them in seclusion together in a private , out-of-the-way cabin  
there , they become friends , then learn about eachother  
once they know everything , they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent , whom they've only heard of  
they learn about eachother's lives in detail , they make sure they look alike ( which requires hair cutting and , notoriously , ear-piercing - a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in "" pulp fiction "" ) , and when the end of summer comes , they switch and hope for the best  
lindsay lohan doesn't necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original  
but she comes off just as appealing as she did once  
she does , though , add a couple new things : she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original , respectively  
she also adds on an american and british accent to each one , with one faking the other accent throughout , and if you really take notice , you can see that the fake ones' accents aren't exactly perfect  
she's also incredibly appealing , not merely cute , which is especially notable since this is her first feature film , and we know how notorious child actors are , especially in their first films  
she makes a great protagonist , and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing  
dennis quaid , in fact , hasn't been this likable in about a decade - his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past , not just that he's mr "

1,"people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies  
often science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller  
in such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked  
but , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic  
such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman  
the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits  
but the right stuff film isn't even fiction  
it was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program  
the plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes  
the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier  
many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado  
but one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records  
ten years later , soviets have launched "" sputnik "" marking the beginning of the space age  
in order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space  
best air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image  
in one of critics' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s  
such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman's film looks quite atypical for its time  
with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life  
but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker  
philip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies  
the right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking "" artsy "" projects  
the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film  
the plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts  
the film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece  
that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles  
sam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty  
on the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases  
shepard's performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn  
young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward  
always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard  
kaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots' wives  
royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b  johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch  
great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman's superb direction  
most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time  
the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline  
everything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world  
in that setting , it's quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights  
but the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and "" natural "" pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots  
their entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity  
this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , "" mercury "" astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space  
those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman's superb use of poetic movie language  
editing is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films ) "

because thats all that there really is     
i found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot  
for one thing , a white leading actor who has a black daughter does leave some curiosity     
i am not saying that this isn't possible   
but it does leave one to wonder    i 
know i did  
another thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out     
and certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations  
there was one scene that should have been short    
but it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking   
ok enough already get on with it  
there are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do    
things just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort    
another thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning  
this movie is also very predictable    
you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment   
granted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you  
also some of the things that happen are a little too predictable and several cliques are repeated   "

soldier a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman 
the warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body  
jungian archetypes , these two opposites need each other to create a whole , but it's difficult to integrate both  
often we'll encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and , with the help of jung's magician , sit around imagining grand schemes  
without the drive to manifest their plans , much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness , all they have are dreams  
warriors on the other hand , are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat , and will do combat with every last bit of their energy  
they don't care enough about anything to know what's worth fighting for : gladiators who live only for the battle  
this dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know , but can also illustrate societies  
america during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers  
todd 3465 ( kurt russell ) is a living , breathing archetype  
chosen from birth as a soldier , he is raised by the government to be a killing machine  
his childhood is cruelty and competition  
he is indoctrinated with the big rules  
never question authority  
winning is everything  
strength beats knowledge  
a veteran of numerous intergalactic wars , todd is 40 and he's obsolete  
a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger  
left for dead after a test battle with the best of the new killers , caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) , he's unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234 , a garbage world  
obviously our hero is still alive  
he finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health  
when the peace-loving colonists get a good look at who todd is , they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world  
they are the other good guys  
these lovers find that they need a warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons  
todd finds himself in the role of protector  
what could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultra-right wing future is ruined by turning the film into a cartoon  
the effects are mostly second-rate explosions or jerky slow motion  
the plot is old hat  
we don't get even a glimpse at the society that created the soldiers  
hardly anything makes sense  
the film's science fares badly  
with all the remarkable advances we've made in just 37 years ( the film takes place in 2036 ) , we're still stupid  
after conquering the stars , for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it to a landfill light years away  
even stranger , the garbage barges appear to double as time machines  
virtually all the trash is vintage 1960  
there is nothing in the story that is not predictable  
the first thing that todd sees after coming back to life is sandra ( connie nielsen ) , the woman just a little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care of him  
it doesn't take a genius to foresee that her husband isn't going to be around much longer  
is it a shock to find out that the film's climax is an unarmed battle between todd and caine ? 
who would you guess wins ? 
some of the scenes would work if this were a comedy  
todd's first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connie's nipple poking through her thin blouse  
later as he sits by his lonely campfire , a tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion  
supposedly this clich ? isn't meant to be humorous  
dastardly col  mekum ( jason isaacs ) with a pencil-thin mustache is as real as snidley whiplash "

-1,"the first image in "" final fantasy : the spirits within "" is a computer-animated close-up of a human eye  
it's a beautiful piece of work , remarkably detailed and quite convincing  
when the picture pulls back to reveal the owner of the eye , however , things change  
the young woman has mesmerizing hair , although it hangs too artfully ? even by movie standards ? to be believed  
the facial features are more detailed than any computer-animation seen to date , but the result is more reminiscent of a very well-crafted doll than anything human  
she is pretty , but bland , and not nearly expressive enough to come off like a person  
all the characters in "" final fantasy "" are like that  
of the core group , the younger white men and women are all athletic , attractive and indistinct , like applicants for a tv reality show  
the black man is taller and burlier , and the aging scholar is bald , with wrinkles and a beard  
none of them appear to be based on individuals ; they all look like the products of general descriptions given a police sketch artist  
it gets worse when they talk and move  
why is the sarcastic voice of steve buscemi , he of the great twisted face and snaggleteeth , coming out of the mouth of some dreary ken doll ? 
why , for every fluid physical gesture , do we also see herky-jerky puppet-style motions ? 
more to the point , who decided a full-length computer animated movie featuring "" hyperreal "" ( their term , not mine ) humanoids was a good idea ? 
 "" final fantasy "" is based on a phenomenally popular video game i've never played , with a story straight out of japanese anime , which more often than not leaves me bored and depressed  
if you're a fan of either , please spare me your letters , as i will focus solely on the finished film and not its source materials  
with an expression-challenged cast , "" final fantasy "" mixes turgid action scenes with heaps of mystical shit  
the result is ugly , confusing and boring  
note : the following reveals the basic plot  
if you want to have a fighting chance of making any sense of the movie , i suggest you read it  
earth is at war with aliens that appear to feed on human souls  
most of our planet is devastated , with humans living in a few protected cities  
while the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies , aki ross ( voiced by ming-na ) and her mentor , dr  sid ( donald sutherland ) , believe in a more organic approach  
they operate on the notion ( quoting straight from the press kit ) "" that all life forms have signature spirit waves that can be identified and contained  
aki and dr  sid collect a series of organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined will form a wave of equal and opposite intensity to the spirit wave of the alien force  
the waves will , in effect , cancel each other out and disarm the foreign contagion  
they have collected six of the eight key spirits needed to complete their wave  
they are on a desperate hunt to find the remaining two spirits before their time runs out  "" 
are you still with me ? 
there's only a little more  
aki is infected with the alien force  
dr  sid has developed a method of confining the contagion and keeping it from killing her , but the defense wall won't hold much longer  
already , the alien is communicating with aki through her dreams  
aiding aki and dr  sid are the deep eyes , a group of hard-as-nails types that would have felt at home with the troops in "" aliens  "" 
capt  gray edwards ( alec baldwin ) heads the task force that consists of a wise guy ( buscemi ) , a tough woman ( peri gilpin ) and a gentle giant ( ving rhames )  
throwing a monkey wrench into the plans is the requisite dumb ass : in this case general hein ( james woods ) , who wants to use the zeus cannon to bomb the aliens back to the stone age , even if it destroys earth as well  
so there you have it  
like most of the anime i've seen , the plot combines apocalyptic settings , lots of shooting and fuzzy spirituality , all wrapped up in a save-the-earth bow  
but i'm bored with apocalyptic settings  
i understand why so many live-action films employ them ? they're cheap ? but animated films can show anything , so why wallow in an industrial trash heap ? 
the action scenes and shoot-em-ups don't satisfy either  
the humans move oddly and their facial features are so muted that the talented voice cast can't bring them to life ( in fact , their efforts merely emphasize what we're missing )  
aki is especially disappointing ; with her lack of expression and flat delivery , she looks and sound like a brunet version of weena , the eloi girl from 1960's "" the time machine "

-1,"absolute power , the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood , attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff  
it is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper  
one can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood  
not only is the plot unbelievable and contrived , but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence  
continually underestimating the audience , the film gives us information we already know or dont even need  
details essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying ( like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two night-vision goggles in their car ? )  
oddly enough , the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities  
a masterful jewel-thief ( played by clint eastwood ) witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire ( played by e  g  
marshall )  
while robbing one of marshalls mansions , he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault  
there , through a two-way mirror , he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay  
their game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman  
in self defense , the woman grabs a letter-opener and stabs the man in the elbow  
she raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men  
the man ? 
he is the president of the united states of america  
where does the film go wrong ? 
it cannot be the acting  
clint eastwood , ed harris and gene hackman as the president give type-cast , but decent performances  
the cinematography is sufficient ; wild and erratic during action sequences , dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes , and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue  
even the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thriller/suspense genre  
the fault clearly lies in the screenplay , and the screenplay alone  
while setting up a story about misuse of power , about the true possessors of that power , and about intrigue and double-crossing , it does not resolve it  
not one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax  
rather , the tense situations are left dangling at the end , giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness  
an example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene : in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood , the police have set up a trap at a small restaurant  
police officers are everywhere , incognito of course  
at the same time , not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives  
all three parties are unaware of each others presence  
this scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood , who might suspect this is a trap , will get himself out of this difficult position  
he will probably have a brilliant plan , involving ingenious preparations  
however , when he arrives at the trap , both hit men miss ( how convenient ) and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away  
the buildup of this scene took about ten minutes  
ten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap  
the scene was resolved in less than 20 seconds    
parallel to the story line of catching the real killer is a cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter  
the daughter blames her father for never being there for her , because he was either in jail or robbing a house somewhere  
of course their relationship takes a turn for the better during the adventure and they end up a happy family  
again , it is commendable that absolute power tries to deviate from the mainstream suspense film by giving room for a dramatic subplot  
however , trying is simply not enough ! 
the second story line should be subtle , original and preferably unpredictable   "

after a hiatus of about fifteen years , the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest  
in early 1997 , there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone , one on television and two in the theaters , with dante's peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar  
of the two , i had heard that dante's peak was the better film , so i decided to check it out when it was released on video  
the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town  
the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption  
flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky , crushing homes and people  
we see people panicking , people crying , and even horses rearing  
it is a disaster of biblical proportions , signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road  
symbolism doesn't get much more blatant than that  
we learn that harry dalton ( pierce brosnan ) , a volcanologist with the u  s  geological survey , was there with his wife when the eruption occurred  
harry survived , but his wife did not  
a few years later , harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante's peak , washington ( which , we are told , has been voted second most desirable place to live ( under 20 , 000 ) by the readers of money magazine )  
there harry meets rachel wando , a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante's peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop  
although the mayor doesn't seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up , a few members of the city council are  
they are afraid that harry's presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante's peak  
they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug  
however , when an amorous young couple takes a skinny-dip in the local hot springs , they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath  
thus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption  
this film contains a number of cliches  
the amorous couple is one  
as soon as they doff their clothes , you know they're going to die  
the town busybody and the abrasive mother-in-law make appearances , as does the death-defying dog  
countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable  
watching the movie , i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements , but some of the dialogue as well  
unfortunate , since much of the dialog is terrible  
for example , harry's boss , paul ( charles hallahan ) , and a team from the u  s  geological survey join harry to assess the situation  
paul basically tells the townsfolk that harry's eruption predictions aren't cause for alarm  
this causes harry to leave in a fit of rage , only to turn up the next day , ready for work  
when paul asks harry why he stayed , he says with grim determination , "" cause this town's in trouble and i'm the best man you've got  "" 
even better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving  
he likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water  
if the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up , however , the frog won't move and will allow itself to be cooked  
 "" is that your recipe for frog soup ? "" 
asks one of the team members  
 "" it's my recipe for disaster , "" responds harry  
dante's peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious  
our heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid  
mayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming , in a very grave tone , "" acid eats metal  ""

 "" don't believe the hype  "" 
this michael douglas vehicle , from the director of "" seven "" , isn't nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe  
the film draws us in with an intriguing concept ( aided no doubt by the riveting trailer ) where a jaded millionaire ( douglas ) is presented with the opportunity to enter into a living fantasy  
this isn't simply virtual reality  
this is real life with a deadly twist  
on his 48th birthday , nicholas van orton ( douglas ) is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother , conrad ( sean penn )  
conrad has a special birthday present for his brother  
he hands nicholas a gift certificate and tells him to contact a company called consumer recreation services  
 "" they make your life fun , "" conrad tells him  
nicholas humors his brother , telling him he'll call , but it's clear he has no time for any foolish , "" fantasy role-playing , "" as he calls it  
then , for reasons that are never really made clear , nicholas decides to go to crs and see what they're all about  
he ends up spending a whole day going through their screening process , which to me made no sense considering the tight schedule he keeps claiming to have  
nevertheless , when it seems nicholas has been rejected as a crs client , the weird things start happening  
of course , when we've only covered about 30 minutes of screen time , what else should we expect  
douglas has built his modern career around playing powerful , violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands  
one of those films , "" basic instinct "" , came from the creative minds of writer , joe eszterhas and director , paul verhoeven  
the premise of "" the game , "" is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film , "" total recall  "" 
in that case , the premise was implanting someone else's memories as a way to enhance one's own life through a dream vacation  
yet , in both films , the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the audience  
we live the adventure along with the protagonist , reacting to each twist and turn  
in theory , the key to the suspense is not being to tell what is real and what isn't  
all we can do is hang on until the end of the ride , when the truth is finally revealed  
now , for those of you who forgot , let me say this again  
 "" don't believe the hype  "" 
 "" the game "" is not a thrilling roller coaster ride  
as a suspense-thriller , it doesn't do much but spin in circles  
by the third reel , i was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as i endured the predictable plot  
is it any wonder douglas won't be able to resist the charms of a mysterious , potentially life-threatening blonde ( ever heard of glenn close ? 
no ? well , how about sharon stone ? 
thought so )  
if anything in this film surprises you at all , i would guess you haven't seen that many films  
there is no suspense here  
trust me , i looked hard to find some  
i had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations  
fincher aim's for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas  
there are those that might say "" the game "" is not intended to be viewed literally  
i would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film  
the film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues  
there is a moment early in the film where van orton , realizing his game has begun , smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out who's in on the whole thing  
he is charged by his paranoia  
he is looking at the world through new eyes  
it is the last thought-provoking moment in the film  
from there on , the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us  
any significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into a plot device "

if there was a possibility to receive a refund , this review would not be forthcoming  
but as it is , "" godzilla "" is without a doubt the loudest , longest , and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio  
producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves , and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch "" last year at merienbad "" until they can grasp the idea of content and plot  
no amount of hype , no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine ( billy the kid vs  
dracula )  
 "" godzilla "" opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs  
we are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship ( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins )  
well , the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature  
later , a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache ( jean reno ) interview the sole survivor  
in a state of shock , the only thing the man can utter is the word "" gojira "" ( the japanese name of the famed beast )  
we are then introduced to dr  nick tatopoulos ( matthew broderick , with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film )  
he is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population  
he is immediately drafted by the u  s  military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature  
in a short amount of time , another fishing boat ( loaded with canned tuna from the u  s  and korea for some reason ) is found grounded in jamaica  
well , it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york  
when the beast finally appears , he tears up one building , stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert ( thumbs up for new york )  
the military , with dr  tatopoulos's help , have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system  
it finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr  tatopoulos who snaps the beast's picture  
the monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting , and the chase is on , with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage  
working from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple , dr  totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated )  
well the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant  
needless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster's nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city ( even though the monster isn't dead yet )  
i sincerely hope that i've completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film  
i gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour's wage on this tripe  
everything about "" godzilla "" reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast  
the script ( and let's be clear here ) by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years "" razzie "" award  
the dialogue between maria pitillo ( as audrey timmonds , dr  tatopoulos' estranged girlfriend ) and mr  broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed )  
the film could be enjoyably campy if it didn't take itself so damn seriously  
but to what end , as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature , nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind  
no  godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it  
the film is bleak and ugly looking "

mercury rising adds to a growing list ( including such stinkers as the jackal , last man standing , striking distance and the last boy scout ) of stale actioners he has headlined  
and though mercury rising tries to spice things up by throwing an autistic kid in the mix , it is every bit as stale  
art jeffries ( bruce willis ) is your typical tormented fbi agent  
you know the type , haunted by his job , yet so good at what he does that even physically assaulting another agent merely gets him a slap on the wrist  
enter simon ( miko hughes ) , an autistic boy , who , like rain man and all other autistic people , is a savant  
he can merely gaze at a super-encrypted message , and , while little computer beeps go off in his head , he can understand what it says  
naturally , this talent has brought him to the attention of the federal government  
lt  col  nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) , an nsa official bubbling over with evil , has spent countless time and money implementing the newest "" unbreakable "" code , mercury  
however , when two of his underlings ( robert stanton and bodhi pine elfman ) publish a mercury-encrypted message in a puzzle magazine as a final test of its effectiveness , simon cracks the code  
naturally , this infuriates kudrow , who sends a terminator-like hitman ( l  l  
ginter ) to eliminate the security hazard  
and that's where art jeffries comes in  
for some reason that's never explained in the film , the fbi is called in to help , and through a series of intricate machinations , art becomes the sole protector of the young autistic boy  
in a few unrealistic sequences , he enlists the aid of a stranger , stacey ( kim dickens ) , to help out , but she is given very little to do overall  
the central concept behind mercury rising is ludicrous  
why bother trying to kill the kid    i 
mean , who would know ? 
it's not like the kid ( or anyone else for that matter ) knew he was cracking a government super-cypher  
and even if he is eliminated , what does that help ? 
he's already proven that mercury can be broken  
there's always the chance that someone else would crack it    but 
i guess without a kid in jeopardy , there's not much of a movie here  
for all its faults , the film actually starts relatively well ( once you pass the painfully familiar teaser )  
the film flirts with developing real characters , and a semblance of a plot    then 
mr  terminator the hitman appears and everything begins going downhill    quickly  
miko hughes does a decent job , for his age , at creating a touching performance  
however , don't go to this film looking for any new insights into autism ( not that many people will )  
instead he merely becomes the latest unique partner in a routine buddy-cop movie ( think cop and a half    with a twist ! ) 
willis and baldwin are just overplaying to type "

-1,"`bats' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan  
to pull something like this off , you need to have a sense of wit and style , with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines  
something like the underground worm thriller `tremors' had just the perfect mixture of these elements , and in return , the film was tremendous fun  
with the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player , `bats' mainly plays it's premise for straight-arrow horror  
judging by the ridiculous premise , this was not exactly a wise move  
the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock's `the birds' , but fails miserably  
done right , it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema  
unfortunately , `bats' is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly , terribly wrong  
the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be  
i will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom `bats' is aimed toward  
those guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats  
these bats are not very nice , because they eat a lot of people  
boy , are these bats ugly  
they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super-duper smart  
they've got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all  
a whole bunch of people in texas get killed , so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats  
they have big guns and other cool things to fight them with , but the bats are pretty smart , so it's sorta hard to do  
the bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good  
but no , `bats' is probably too violent for pre-schoolers  
the film , directed by louis morneau , should have ventured straight into video stores  
on the small screen , perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations  
but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward ; although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure , the film is poorly written , poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude  
even the bats themselves are cheesy , and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed  
the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey ( lou diamond phillips ) , who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small-town authority figure usually portrays ( he chomps on a cigar , struts contentedly in his boots , etc    )  
the scientist is dr  sheila casper ( dina meyer ) , who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as `the best in her field'  
meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable , but everything about dr  casper is recycled beyond recognition  
her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hooper's tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in `jaws'  
everything revolving around `bats' is tired drivel , which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up  
the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw , with voices dubbed in later  
in fact , that may have worked out better in the end  
take one glance at casper's bat-loathing sidekick jimmy ( leon ) , and you'll have immediate deja vu - he's the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie , constructed specifically for timed comic relief  
unfortunately , none of his comic interludes are funny  
in the role of deranged mad scientist dr  mccabe , the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch  
mccabe `accidentally' released two experimental test subjects , and the virus spread to other bats  
the entire town of gallup , texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures , but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else  
something like : `when is the damn movie going to be over ? ? 
i just want my money  ' 
the bats are ugly , i must say "

hc : as we go to the top of the 8th , we're joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli , who's here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie , major league : back to the minors , the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors  
nice to see you , jim  
as a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer , can you give us the scoop on the new flick ? 
jb : my opinion : the producers should have stopped while they were ahead , and that was nine years ago  
one entry was definitely enough , and i'm surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2  this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct-to-video  
it's worse than a mediocre made-for-tv feature  
i should also mention that this movie likely won't play all that well in cleveland  
now that the real indians are perennial contenders , they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks  
actually , most of the action involves the twins' aaa minor league club , the buzz , rather than the actual major league franchise  
hc : sorry to interrupt , jim , but we still have to do play-by-play for the game on the field  
leading off this inning is john warren  
he steps into the batter's box and takes kent's pitch low for ball one  
wh : so , the story's strictly minor league , right ? 
what's it about ? 
jb : scott bakula , the guy from quantum leap , plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell  
when twins owner roger dorn , once again portrayed by corbin bernsen , needs a new manager for his aaa team , he offers the job to gus , who is now faced with two daunting tasks : turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson ( played by walt goggins ) for a promotion to "" the show  "" 
with the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano ( dennis haysbert ) , rube baker ( eric bruskotter ) , and isuro tanaka ( takaaki ishibashi ) , gus gets the buzz on the right track  
in fact , he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the big-league club , leonard huff ( played with over-the-top relish by ted mcginley )  
soon , dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus' overachieving group against huff's overpaid , last-place bunch  
wh : can we guess who wins ? 
jb : the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when you've already seen the box score  
on top of that , none of the mock-ups are presented with much flair  
they're not just boring ; they're lackluster  
but the major league movies have never been about drama or tension ; they've been about using baseball situations to generate laughs  
hc : warren fouls off a fastball  
1 and 1  
wh : are there lots of yuks in this one ? 
jb : not one , from start to finish  
i enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny  
okay , a lot of the jokes were sophomoric , but they made me laugh  
the two sequels haven't just been stale , but their humor quotient has been abysmally low  
even bob uecker's once-sharp one-liners have turned lame , and they're the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing  
hc : here's the 1-1 pitch  
looooooong drive ? fair or foul ? foul ball ! 
the count goes to 1 and 2  
wh : does the film at least get the baseball details correct ? 
jb : yes  
there aren't any glaring errors like there were in one of the best-ever baseball movies , the natural  
but i'd gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story , believable characters , or even a little genuine humor  
heck , the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league : back to the minors  
wh : it's nice to see old friends one more time , isn't it ? 
like cerrano , tanaka , and dorn  
jb : depends on whether you really care that anyone is back  
there aren't any real characters here ? just an assortment of cliched oddballs  
yeah , the voodoo hitter , the catcher who can't throw back to the pitcher , the japanese player , and the conceited player-turned-owner have all returned , but who really cares ? 
they have no depth  
notable absences include tom berenger's veteran and charlie sheen's "" wild thing  "" 
we don't really miss them , though  
hc : breaking ball , low and outside

-1,"the blues brothers was a wonderful film , a hilarious comedy packed with good music  
it cried out for a sequel , but john belushi's untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea  
however , eighteen years have passed , and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged  
unfortunately , it's a sequel not worthy of the original  
the film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended  
elwood blues ( dan aykroyd ) is just getting out of jail , his brother jake having recently died  
as in the first film , he first visits mother mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) and then sets about getting the band back together  
john belushi's absence leaves a terrible hole in the film , and although three new characters are created to fill the void , it is still very noticeable  
first , there's cabel ( joe morton ) the illegitimate son of elwood's stepfather ( played by cab calloway in the first movie )  
cabel is reluctant to join his destiny , and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff , chasing the blues brothers band  
next , there's mighty mack ( john goodman ) , a bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band  
finally , there's buster ( j  
evan bonifant ) , a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood and eventually joins the band  
the plotting of the film is hardly original    it 
seems to be almost a clone of the original  
elwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member of the band , they then travel , while being pursued by the police , and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale  
the first film had neo-nazis as the random element , this time around , the russian mafia and a militia group fill their role  
in fact , the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical to the original  
remember the classic performance at country bob's ( where they like both types of music : country and western ) from the first movie ? 
well , this movie has a performance at a country fair , where the band is expected to play bluegrass music  
there's the massive police car pileup , although this time the gag falls completely flat  
there's even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of reverend cleophus ( james brown )  
there are plenty of recurring characters too  
in addition to mother stigmata and reverend cleophus , aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs  murphy  
frank oz , a prison guard in the first film , makes an appearance here as the prison warden  
as the stars , the new blues brothers don't live up to their legacy  
aykroyd is more loquacious , yet much flatter as elwood  
john goodman barely has a character as mighty mack  
joe morton has the deepest character , but not a terribly interesting one , as cab  
and what's the deal with the orphan ? 
it plays like a desperate gimmick that doesn't mesh at all with the rest of the film  
at least bonifant isn't as precocious as he could have been in the role  
but the true star , and the only saving grace , of the film is the music  
and the film is packed with it ( even during and after the ending credits )  
although there are no brilliant mergers of comedy and song as in the original's rawhide/stand by your man medley , the music is very much enjoyable  
to top it off , the film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearances  
b  b  king , blues traveler , eric clapton , travis tritt , wilson pickett , erykah badu , bo diddley and steve winwood are just a sampling of the multitude of stars that make an appearance here and there  
unfortunately , the music pauses here and there to allow in the familiar plot  
if simply copying the original blues brothers wasn't bad enough , writers aykroyd and john landis dumb it down , removing any memorable characters , and replacing them with flashy , but unbelievable , magical gimmicks  
it's a shame "

-1,"the most interesting part of "" can't hardly wait "" just happens to be not only the most human , but for many of us , the one part that many of us can easily relate to  
that is the character of denise ( lauren ambrose ) , the film's sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film , and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored  
the film wisely holds over this moment , nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party    almost 
too nicely  
for some members of the audience ( read : me ) , this is basically a mirror of what's going on with them watching this film  
we sit there wondering why we've even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place  
i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this  
after all , this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with  
everyone's here : the jock , the homecoming queen , the nerd ( and his dominions of trekkies and x-philes ) , the alienated wannabe writer , the school spirit girl , the pothead ( s ) , the wigger , etc , etc , etc , and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial , lame , and basically as a bunch of losers  
except for denise , who rolls her eyes at everything , and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks ( her yearbook entry , something which is done for each main character , quotes oscar wilde - definite pointers there )  
unfortunately , the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film  
the film , as i said , portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything  
however , instead of sticking with this , perhaps even going a bit further with it , they let this lie , and actually make these characters into our heroes  
we follow several of them , all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism , and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared and/or identified with them  
and if we did , we certainly don't want to revisit that state of being  
here's a quick low-down : it's graduation , and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night , otherwise known as the "" american grafitti "" or , to a lesser extent , the "" dazed and confused "" cliche  
the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly ; the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party  
 "" can't hardly wait "" just opts for a big indoor keg party , and a little bit of aimless driving , albeit of the i'm-whining-because-i-can't-get-a-girl-i-want brand  
we follow many people around , but mostly we trail preston ( ethan embry , of "" that thing you do ! "" ) , the alienated writer , who's been pining over the homcoming queen , amanda ( the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt ) , for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart  
now that she's broken up with her football player boyfriend , mike ( peter facinelli ) , he decides to go to the party with a note he's written declaring his "" love "" for her in the hopes he'll build up the guts to give it to her    even 
though he's leaving for a multi-week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut ( okay : the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson ? )  
since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn't be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film , and because it's a party , there are some more main characters , such as : william ( charlie korsmo , finally surfacing after "" dick tracy "" ) , the nerd ( and his dominions ) who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike , who's humiliated him for years , but gets too caught up in drinking to do it ; kenny ( seth green ) , the wigger , who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid ( uh huh ) ; and denise , the only exceptional character , who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom ( don't ask ) with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile  
ugh  
the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not "" american grafitti "" or "" dazed and confused , "" two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers ( not to mention were extremely entertaining ) , but to john hughes films of the 80s , most notably "" sixteen candles  "" 
the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters , and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion  
this film forgets to satirize its characters , and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes    and 
then says that it's all okay  
we can't take this film seriously , nor can we take this as fun , so really what good is it ? 
but i will tell you some things i did like : i liked the direction , except for a couple too-over-the-top features , like way-too-glossy jump cuts ( it's like an oxymoron ) and other obscurities  
generally , though , elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement , and even manage to capture an altman-esque feel to their film from time to time ( a thing with a note , though , is too hokey to really be admirable )  
i actually did like seth green , for once in about a decade ( when he played a very young woody allen in "" radio days "" ) - his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable    almost  
and , of course , lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise , the one character we could have used some more of , even though it would have changed the entirety of the film  
however , the character of denise really doesn't work with the film , when really thought about  
she's far too witty and realized ( at least for the first half ) to belong in this film , and whenever she appears , she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone  
she's not just the cynic or the intellectual ; she's just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters "

-1,"the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities  
the best tales of the genre deal with mankind's struggle for survival or knowledge  
such popular and noteworthy tomes as "" stranger in a strange land "" by robert heinlein , "" childhood's end "" by arthur c  clarke and "" man in the high castle "" and "" do androids dream of electric sheep "" by philip k  dick all deal with man's need for identity and struggle for self worth  
hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu ( if not the message ) of science fiction since it's beginnings  
most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved  
it really wasn't until producer george pal , took charge of robert heinlein's novel "" rocketship galileo "" and crafted the film "" destination moon "" , that 'sci-fi' ( as it is commonly referred to ) , came into it's own  
from there , such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick , have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre  
with the release of touchstone pictures "" mission to mars "" , we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci-fi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe  
the film opens on a summer barbecue , as phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission  
woody blake ( tim robbins ) and his wife terri ( connie nielsen ) commit to his coming authority on the mission , and luc goddard ( don cheadle ) consoles his son  
entering the party is jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife , maggie ( kim delaney )  
luc consoles jim with woody's assistance  
the three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them  
but jim still longs to set foot on the red planet  
the mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars  
they send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface  
going out to investigate , luc and his team approach the famed 'face on mars'  
a strange noise emanates from the rock  
as the team tries to scan through the rock with radar , a violent wind storm erupts , creating a vortex that kills all members of the team , save for luc  
back on the space station orbiting earth , woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing  
luc's interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team  
the second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger  
meteorite showers , explosions , and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet's surface  
the big question is , is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars  
and if so , what is its relationship with us ? 
now for the bad news  
the entire plot of "" mission to mars "" is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe  
the famed 'face on mars' becomes the centerpiece of the film , revealing some of the most harebrained sci-fi pabulum the screen has witnessed  
borrowing ideas from such films as "" robinson crusoe on mars "" ( 1964 ) , quatermass and the pit ( 1967 ) , "" 2001 : a space odyssey "" , and even mario bava's "" planet of the vampires "" ( 'terrore nello spazio' ) ( 1965 ) , "" mission to mars "" is a hodgepodge of ideas that don't add up to a satisfying whole  
while some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed , the film remains flat and un-involving  
so much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film , but to no good use  
the performances are all workmen like , with only don cheadle ( as luc ) carrying any sort of real chemistry  
gary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation  
and the mistaken idea of having jerry o'connell ( as phil ohlmyer ) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse  
and the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better  
he's just having too much fun here to give a damn  
the script has a few lapses , namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower , no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage  
this of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship  
also , when one character sacrifices himself , the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation  
but the biggest offence in the film is the horrid , intrusive score by ennio morricone  
subtlety is non-existent here  
in fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out "

-1,"it seemed like the perfect concept  
what better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? 
it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh  
jim carrey's signed on too ? 
even better  
the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as "" schizophrenia , "" and so forth  
such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire , proving that some people just couldn't take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy  
yes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny  
it's not for lack of trying  
the farrellys utilize in "" me , myself & irene "" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them  
this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult  
soon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster  
this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted , or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street  
then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks  
some have suggested that this isn't a problem , because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work  
they're wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort , 1996's "" there's something about mary  "" 
 ( 1999's "" outside providence "" was technically an earlier project  ) 
the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected  
in "" mary , "" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion  
 "" me , myself & irene , "" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at "" mary "" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work  
having been produced by the same guys who made "" mary , "" "" irene "" seems like an even bigger disappointment  
the brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes  
but they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh ; most of "" me , myself & irene "" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy  
the plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p  waters ( renee zellweger ) , who's in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that's entirely predictable from the get-go  
 ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? 
yeah , me too  ) 
the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be  
compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it's no longer funny , merely gross  
the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry  
take , for example , the subplot involving charlie's three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon )  
the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face  
but by the end of the film , they're still doing the same schitck ; it hasn't been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn't been dropped either  
that's too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through  
 "" me , myself & irene "" reeks of wasted opportunities  
there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie's new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank's actions  
this doesn't really happen ; nearly every supporting character learns about charlie's condition early on , so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it  
the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , "" whitey "" ) , but the script doesn't go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax  
jim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he's left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in "" all of me  "" 
it's a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny  
carrey doesn't pull any stunts we don't expect him to pull , and the farrellys' script doesn't give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren't set up in any meaningful way  
perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better  
zellweger's irene is not a strong female lead ; mary in "" mary "" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed  
irene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she's ditzy , clever , or neither  
as such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only "" sane "" person in the film  
chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this "

ewan mcgregor - codename : "" eye "" - is pointing a high-tech rifle-ly gadget at a fat , bald business-oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across the street  
we get the requisite electro-green through-the-sight view  
we the audience , seeing a high tech rifle-ly gadget , of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target , but instead , he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy , low-quality photographs , which eye then proceeds to fax and e-mail to everyone in his target's office  
all right , so thirty seconds in , i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle/camera , but i was still open minded    
maybe there's a really good reason for it  
i've got reason to believe , you see - i admire a lot of ewan mcgregor's previous work    
and he's obi wan ke- friggin-nobi for god's sake  
and director stephan elliot's last movie priscilla , queen of the desert was a quirky little delight  
there's some genuine talent involved here  
i think at the twenty minute mark , there was still a spark of hope in my heart  
eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization's son ( i still have no idea what this organization was - british intelligence ? 
national spy ring ? 
private investigation ? ) , who is apparently stealing from his trust fund  
he has received his assignment from k  d  
lang , through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase  
when eye tracks his target to an expensive- looking secluded house , he witnesses a mysterious and beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) take a knife out and proceed to stab the poor bastard  
ok , that's odd , i think to myself , this could be interesting  
then she starts to cry , and through her tears exclaims "" merry christmas , dad ! "" 
for the first time  
so begins our tale of obsession    
or    something  
the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor's eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states , totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar  
throughout his entire professional life , he has been a voyeur ; so when he falls for someone , the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras  
fine , that's a lovely premise , i suppose  
but gosh darn it , if you're going to go there , you better have some sort of explanation  
and that's precisely where this film fails  
this is the kind of movie that pisses me off  
it's an abortion , a collection of half-formed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end  
it pretends it is something that it is not - a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a high-tech thriller  
here , the filmmakers have confused "" surreal "" and "" deep "" with "" vaguely unclear "" and "" crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors  "" 
i never , even for an instant , had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in "" love "" with this woman who changes wigs and kills people  
the movie offers only two explanations , neither of which make a lick of sense  
explanation number one : the obnoxious presence of eye's imaginary daughter , who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago , tells him he shouldn't leave ms  judd  
explanation two , which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie : "" beauty is in the eye of the beholder "

-1,"if anything , "" stigmata "" should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly-themed films relatively close to one another  
of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year , it is clearly the worst  
i suppose i should have seen this coming  
after all , "" blair witch "" thoroughly creeped me out , "" sixth sense "" was mildly spooky , and then "" stir of echoes "" had its moments , but wasn't anything i'd lose sleep over  
clearly , the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping  
is it then any surprise that "" stigmata "" is the dullest , most horribly executed piece of mtv-influenced tripe i have seen in a long while ? 
no , not really  
patricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe-trotting mother  
as it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently-deceased brazilian priest  
the priest's church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue  
father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue  
his investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ  
father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie' s story , considering she's an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on  
he eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church  
as it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a "" fifth gospel "" before they were excommunicated  
the new rupert wainwright music video  
  
  
i mean film "" stigmata "" is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse  
indeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it's only interesting for about five minutes  
i'm not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion , double-exposure , and extreme close-ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school  
his camera trickery is interesting for a little while , but eventually , it becomes headache-inducing  
what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is ) , with wainwright screaming at the audience , "" see ? 
look at what i can do ! 
i'm an ex-cellent dir-ect-or  "" 
maybe then he'd explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! )  
if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn't see it  
just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double-exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever  
arrrrrrrghhhh  
  
  
then again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn't bother me if "" stigmata "" had a story or characters that were remotely engaging  
though wainwright's vanity certainly doesn't help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script  
where are plot continuity and character development when you need them ? 
case in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with , but we aren't given any back story on her character , or any reason to like her  
the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she's kind of cute , so let's start the bleeding ! 
the fact that she's clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn't help , either  
according to frankie page , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ? 
go clubbing ! 
sure , that makes sense  
arquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking  
scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable  
even though frankie page's life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon  
even more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances  
father andrew's religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic  
as for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , "" i'll get you , my pretty , "" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded  
trust me , i'm not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain  
what's worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible  
first of all , the film doesn't even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details  how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ? 
how come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ? 
actually , i'm not sure what frankie was posessed by "

it does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors , led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director ( todd holland ) , all wanted to make this film  
in fact , it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf's tribe as possible  
in retrospect , i can imagine how bad this film could have been  
i shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss  
dreyfuss plays james krippendorf , an anthropologist who is granted $100 , 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea  
halfway into his two-year expedition , his wife ( apparently ) dies  
i say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established  
later , we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big-screen tvs and other such pleasures  
so , when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely , he decides to construct an elaborate lie  
he makes his own tribe , using his three children as actors in a video  
he simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe ( which he calls the shelmickedmu )  
audiences at krippendorf's lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision  
and proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community  
like all films like this , the lie becomes more and more complex , and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero  
dreyfuss is a funny , talented man , and he is funny in this film  
he has lots of positive energy and , unlike most comical actors , really manages to play people like this realistically  
this film also requires a lot of physical humor that i've never seen dreyfuss perform , and he does a great job  
jenna elfman , who plays veronica mecilli , a scientist who wants in on krippendorf's work , is also very funny and appealing here  
and the kid actors are great , as well  
but we're talking about the script from hell  
this is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen  
but the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it  
all the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew  
no , the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and mean-spirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched  
furthermore , the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless  
take , for instance , the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex  
they get all decked out in the tribe getup , complete with paint to darken their skin  
krippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe  
now , i saw this scene coming from a mile away , but i said to myself , "" no , that would be far too tasteless  
there's no way they'll do that    oh 
god ! "" 
they did do it  
it's there  
i was almost more appalled by the fact that this didn't bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film  
i found it deplorable  
and when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it , he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice  
the film is filled with scenes like these  
they not only insult the audience , but they insult the types of people that the film portrays  
it would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists , yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon  
and watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining , but i think that most members of the on-screen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes  
if i were an anthropologist , this film would insult me immensely "

mr  
magoo , they claimed , would be an insult to the men and women they represented  
in fact , they were wrong  
mr  
magoo is not just an insult to the blind and near-blind , it's an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny , 90 minute atrocity  
it's stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas  
look at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases , and you'll see a shocking list of retreads , including 101 dalmatians , george of the jungle , jungle2jungle , that darn cat ! , flubber , and now mr  
magoo  
the best of these ( george of the jungle ) was mildly entertaining  
the worst , mr  
magoo , exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be  
the first problem with mr  
magoo is the script  
despite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft , mr  
magoo is comically barren  
from beginning to end , there's not a laugh to be found  
every attempt at humor -- and there are lots of them -- falls flat with an audible thud  
you'd think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film , at least a few would work , but that's not the case  
i've had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures  
then there's leslie nielsen , who looks , sounds , and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character ( memorably voiced by jim backus )  
in the past , nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun  
lately , however , he has been getting lazy , taking parts in the likes of dracula : dead and loving it , spy hard , and mr  
magoo  
even if nielsen was in top form , it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo ( especially since we're reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film ) , but "" top form "" is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here  
this is strictly a take-the-money-and- run operation  
the story , which , like many disney stories , can be described in one long sentence : magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum , and , as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own , the police mistake him for the robber  
the cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky , who take their lumps early and often  
the bad guys are kelly lynch ( who does a lot of martial arts-type kicking ) , nick chinlund , and malcolm mcdowell ( who has the good sense to look embarrassed )  
matt keeslar portrays one of magoo's sidekicks -- his nephew , waldo  
the bumbling man's other , more interesting companion is a dog named angus  
most of mr  
magoo's humor comes in the form of failed slapstick  
the cartoon violence level in this film doesn't approach that of home alone 3 or flubber , but it's still pretty acute , with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices  
there's a non-violent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better , but , compared to mr  bean's recent , similar misadventure , it doesn't hold up well  
then there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoo's near blindness , such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby  
i'm willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack  
tong , a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market , has helmed several jackie chan movies , including first strike , rumble in the bronx , and supercop

like john woo ( hard target ) and ringo lam ( maximum risk ) before him , it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making a bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream  
it is worth noting that , unlike many disney films which hold a perverse appeal for the under-10 crowd while driving parents to distraction , mr "

as the movie's writer , director , executive producer , and star , murphy will shoulder all of the blame if harlem nights fails  
but at the same time , he'll receive all of the credit if it succeeds  
should you sacrifice your hard-earned cash to support murphy's risky gamble ? 
well , that depends on whom you trust more : me or eddie murphy  
here's what murphy thinks : "" i think the audience is expecting a good time  
they gonna get sexy  
they gonna get funny  
they gonna get drama  
they gonna get all of that  
i think it's the best movie i've done "" ( paramount radio network )  
here's what i think : harlem nights is charmless , unoriginal , disappointing , and almost without question , the worst film of the actor's career ( i haven't seen best defense )  
and guess who's to blame ? ! 
the movie's problem is not murphy's direction : harlem nights is a fairly good looking film  
no , the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled  
murphy's awful script is the culprit  
let's count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting : 
 ( 1 ) murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture  
yes , he even outdoes his own work in raw  
practically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word  
and after 15 minutes , it gets irritating  
 ( 2 ) murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast  
richard pryor , redd foxx , michael lerner , and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with stereotypes  
each of them shines occasionally , but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle  
 ( 3 ) the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men  
murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life , which is really neither here nor there  
but when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3 , 000 movie screens across the country , it's another matter altogether  
you're forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff  
for instance , murphy punches della reese in the stomach  
and he shoots jasmine guy in the head  
this is a mean-spirited movie , folks ! 
lovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy in her role as a common whore , but only because she doesn't have any scenes with murphy  
thank god : he might have run her over with a bulldozer  
 ( 4 ) murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date  
the loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges only once or twice during the film  
murphy would rather give his character a spiffy wardrobe than a spiffy personality  
sometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he could wear fancy suits and look debonair  
 ( 5 ) the plot is a shameless rip-off of the sting  
if you're going to make another sting movie , you've got to do something original  
murphy's tale of warring nightclub owners in harlem ( circa 1938 ) fails to add anything new to the formula  
 ( 6 ) to get laughs , murphy makes fun of stuttering  
you know a comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped  
 ( 7 ) murphy's idea of drama is a scene in which his character apologizes for the first time in his life  
for what ? 
for shooting reese's little toe off ! 
needless to say , murphy shows little , if any , promise or imagination as a screenwriter  
in all fairness , however , a few rays of sunshine do manage to break through the gloomy cloud surrounding the movie  
danny aiello is fun to watch as a dirty cop on the take  
aiello stands out in the large , ensemble cast : he obviously relishes the opportunity to play such a nasty character ( a racist detective with mob ties ) "
-1," "" battlefield earth "" is the best comedy of the year  
it has to be  
the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider  
bad movie syndrome struck me again , so after witnessing how much "" battlefield earth "" has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles , i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first-hand  
is it as bad as advertised ? 
oh yes , very much so  
the plot is incomprehensible  
the acting is atrocious  
the special effects are mediocre  
the action is dull  
the implausibilities are legion  
the dialogue is cringe-inducing  
the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny  
i don't even want to continue reviewing this movie ; i'd like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible , but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory , so here it is : 
the premise is basically a rip-off of "" planet of the apes , "" only minus the apes and philosophical discussion , and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo  
the year is 3000 , the psychlos have conquered earth , and the human population has been enslaved  
only a handful of humans escaped to radiation-rich areas to escape the aliens ; they live out their lives in fear  
one man , johnny goodboy ( i know , i know ) tyler ( barry pepper ) , ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos  
there he confronts the psychlo head of security : a big , ugly , klingon-looking creature called terl ( john travolta )  
pressed into slavery , johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back  
meanwhile , terl is faced with his own problems : he has recently learned that he's stuck living on earth ( which he hates ) for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man's daughter  
he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology ( this is where the plot gets ridiculous  
  
  ) 
so the "" man-animal "" can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos can't go  
terl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself  
of course , his plan doesn't work  
so many things wrong with this movie -- where to begin ? 
how about with travolta , whose hollywood clout brought about this , the cinematic version of scientology guru l  ron hubbard's sci-fi novel ? 
early previews for "" battlefield earth , "" with constant shots of a makeup-laden travolta cackling like lex luthor , had me ( and several audience members ) remarking , "" what the hell is travolta thinking ? "" 
the movie did nothing to stem such remarks  
all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here : terl cackles after nearly every line , and so does every other psychlo  
of course , this makes every scene hilariously overwrought , no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary  
the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america , but ceos generally don't laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees  
 ( "" you were going to be promoted -- but now you're not ! 
fwahahahahahahahaha ! ! ! ! ! "" ) 
it's no big surprise terl loses to the humans -- he's an idiot  
he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book  
he underestimates his enemies , assuming he'll win just because he's smarter  
 ( he uses the word "" leverage "" like some sort of scientologist mantra  ) 
not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero , he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos' language and technology  
 ( why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me  ) 
he then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him  
no wonder this guy never got his promotion  
the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention  
why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive ? 
how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open ? 
how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1 , 000 years ? 
and how do all these previously brain-dead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly ? 
there's a whole lot more to scratch one's head about in "" battlefield earth  "" 
bring a scorecard to track the plot holes  
director roger christian shoots "" battlefield earth "" in the most distracting way possible , tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason  
all the characters appear to be standing on the walls , and it's awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue "

-1,"capsule : not as bad a sequel as crow 2 or batman & robin , but still horribly putrid , cheesy and ill-conceived  
this one belongs in saturday morning cartoons    
extended review : you know , about halfway through this movie , i realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes , you'd have a damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy , hong kong style martial arts  
beautifully choreographed by robin shou , who also plays liu kang , the fight scenes are both mind-blowing and graceful , acrobatic enough to make olympic gymnasts weep  
this is what made the original so fun , but unfortunately for the sequel , we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson  
instead , they got john r  leonetti , the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat  
not a good choice  
while the fight scenes are brutal and eye-popping , the rest of the movie looks like standard made for tv fare  
the acting is sub-par , which i could endure if it were not for a  ) the director's style , b  ) the special effects , & c  ) the treatment of the story and characters  
a  ) mr  leonetti should go back to lighting , in my opinion  
i could say dozens of bad things about him : he way overuses slow-motion , he has no eye for action , he can't get even mediocre performances out of actors , and so on  
but by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping  
apparantly , everybody can now fly  
hell , i'm all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick and whatnot , but not when it happens every few minutes , and is done so poorly  
better jumping and acrobatics has been seen in xena : warrior princess  
in short , they should have gotten paul anderson back  
or at least let robin shou direct    
b  ) unlike the first one , whose sfx were vibrant and somewhat realistic , mk : a's special effects are bland , fake looking , and overall just plain bad  
i counted at least half a dozen times that blue-screening was painfully obvious  
had this movie been made in the 80's , it would have been ground-breaking  
but in today's industry , it doesn't even look finished  
c  ) now for the _really_ bad parts  
i admit , i'm an avid fan of the mortal kombat series  
the games are amusing diversions , an easy way to work off stress and anger  
the first movie was a mindlessly fun thrillride  
this could have been a really cool movie  
it isn't  
the writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower the target audience from teens to preschoolers  
some of the plot elements are just plain stupid  
how stupid ? 
take , for instance , how our heroes move around  
they use giants spheres the roll around underground , supposedly at thousands of miles per hour "

-1,"m : i-2 , the sequel to mission impossible , is a james bond wannabe film , but it fails to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertainment value  
it tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it's an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses  
it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human  
the coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols  
the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence  
except for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed  
as for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen  
m : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue  
the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point  
the only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film's supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way  
it's a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series  
but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance  
john woo ( "" broken arrow "" / "" face/off "" ) is good at doing car chases , choreographed fights with midair flips and kung-fu kicks , slo-mo shots of two guns blazing , and of fire explosions , but he just can't seem to handle dialogue and suspense  
the star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast  
cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one  
their romance didn't work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn't convincing  
the film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success  
we will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney , the american southwest , and seville  
first , we are in sydney , australia , where a scientist with a muffled russian accent , dr  nekhorvich ( rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it  
he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain  
which explains the film's mythic theme    as 
we enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil  
the one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role  
at least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense  
soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains  
before they crash the plane and parachute out of it , the one who was posing as dimitri , turns out to be sean ambrose ( scott ) , a rogue member of the imf , which is a cia-like clone  
he steals the package with the antidote , peels off a latex mask , which is a replica of the hero of the story , ethan hunt ( cruise ) , who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust  
sean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices  
we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel  
woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain  
it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense  
next we are in a mountain range in the american southwest , and ethan is on vacation , hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool , when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard , delivers via a rocket launcher , a pair of talking sunglasses  
hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help , billy baird ( john polson ) and luther stickell ( ving rhames ) , with luther running a high-gadget computer , but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall ( thandie ) to join his team  
he is told , as an incentive to recruit her , all her criminal charges will be dropped  
hopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self-destruct in five seconds  
actually , with the departure of hopkins , it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at this point  
in seville , hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase , where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road  
he also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal , and learns that she is valuable because her ex-boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f * ck her  
the imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f * ck him , as she leads them to his hide-out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort , the south african , hugh stamp ( richard roxburgh )  
robert towne , the screenwriter , who contributed to the first "" mission , "" who is noted for doing "" chinatown "" -- writes a colorless , pedestrian script , one that fails even to be funny in a camp way "
-1,
-1,"the above is dialogue from this film , taken almost completely in context , and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is  
it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film , and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about , especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously  
mr  gregg "" i'm-having-a-mid-life-crisis "" araki , the writer and director of this film , wants to show how important teenagers are , and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible , horrible world  
and how does he show it ? 
by really cheap surrealism , and moronic exchanges like this  
oh , and it gets better  
a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of , oh i dunno , the fiftieth sex scene in this film ( i'm not counting the several masturbation scenes )  
in it , one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another , and he says to her something along the lines of "" do you ever wonder what life is all about ? "" 
sorry , man : foreplay takes place before the act of coitus  
of course , what do you expect : the film was written and directed by a guy who can't even spell his first name right ( yes , i know it's a cheap joke , but it had to be done )  
 "" the doom generation "" is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them , and also as another "" teen angst "" film ( one of the slogans is "" teen is a four-letter word "" - hardy har har )  
it's a film about two angsty teens - amy blue ( rose macgowan , who would later play the buxom tatum in "" scream "" ) and jordon white ( james duval , who would go on to play randy quaid's son in "" independence day "" ) - who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac , xavier red ( jonathan schaech , who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in "" that thing you do ! "" 
- and by the way , do you get the symbolism ? 
red , white , and blue ? 
huh ? 
huh ? ) , and go on a road trip where three things happen , in no order : 1 ) they have sex ; 2 ) they run into weird people ; 3 ) they kill them  
the film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films  
gregg araki obviously has seen such films as "" easy rider , "" "" natural born killers , "" and "" kalifornia , "" and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide  
but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not , or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper  
 "" the doom generation "" doesn't want to do this ; it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level  
he wants to show everything in a weird manner , and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about  
here's one scene , an earlier scene in the film : amy and jordan go into a quick-e mart type place to get food and other stuff  
amy is smoking , and the clerk , an asian man mind you ( i love how racist this film is , i really do ) , tells her to put it out  
she tells him to fuck off or something to that note  
he points a shotgun at her , and she puts it out reluctantly  
jordan makes two hot dogs , and takes them to the counter  
the cash register rings up "" 6  66 "" 
 ( oh , and this symbolism doesn't stop here )  
jordan checks for his wallet but it's really in the car  
he asks amy for it , but she left her wallet in the car as well  
the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money  
they say they don't have it  
he gets ready to kill them , but then xavier , who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before , pops out of nowhere , fights with the clerk , and ends with him blowing the clerk's head clean off ( clean wound , mind you )  
the head is shown flying through the air , and lands in a fryer , where it begins to scream  
i don't really object to this kind of sick violence , but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only : to gross you out  
araki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme , he'll make some kind of art  
wrong  
it takes a kind of resistance to make gore art  
when george romero made "" dawn of the dead , "" a very gory flick even for today , he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick  
same goes for peter jackson's disgustingly gory "" dead alive , "" which features a 30 minute long fest of blood , guts , dismemberments , flesh chewing , and other assorted stuff , all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body , taking out all sorts of zombies  
it was sick , but it was also satirical , and controled  
a scene like this has no purpose in the film , and it sticks out from everything else that happens  
here's a couple other scenes : jordan and amy have sex in a bath tub and xavier watches , masturbates , and then licks the semen from his hand ; xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window , masturbates , and falls backwards ; a man attacks the trio , and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword ( put there just so this could happen ) ; a fast food employee stalks the trio , and his arm is shot off by xavier ; and various other annoyances  
also , look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people , who probably didn't really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it ( just like peter o'toole , helen mirren , malcolm macdowell , and john gielgud probably didn't when they signed to be in "" caligula "" )  
people such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt , alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel , hollywood madam heidi fleiss , christopher "" peter brady "" mcknight , amanda bearse , and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds , then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line  
why are they here ? 
so that we can all point to them and say "" hey , look it's ( fill in the blank ) ! 
wow ! "" 
gimme a break  
the film's meaning is pretty easy to detect : that , you know , teens are so precious , and the world is such a horrible place , that when the two entities collide , there's a giant explosion of horrific violence  
otherwise defined as "" teen angst , "" or the belief that being a teenager is a horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you "

-1,"'bicentennial man' is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment  
chris columbus , the director who gave you "" mrs  doubtfire "" , plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point  
based on the short story by isaac asimov , it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human , which as you can imagine is very difficult  
starting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children  
soon this robot , called andrew ( robin williams ) shows abilities that makes his owner mr  martin ( sam neill ) very curious  
andrew is interested in art and music , he "" enjoys "" making clocks , which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions  
it shows out that because of a small failure in the "" electrical circuits "" and "" positronic brain "" andrew has accidentally gained a soul  
this makes him unique and his evil creators worried  
then mr  martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn't programmed to do  
soon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom , destiny and love  
this film can be described as a disney version of blade runner , a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction  
ever since that film , the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy  
what makes us human ? 
the thoughts ? 
the emotions ? 
is it possible to become human ? 
at what point can we say to a robot "" now you are one of us "" ? 
these are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach  
it is obvious that columbus didn't take them very seriously  
when you think about it , this film is not really meditating on the question "" when is a robot no longer a machine , but a human being ? "" , but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding  
andrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being , and only the society has troubles with it  
in other words , it is as far from reality as from the academy awards  
further more , there are other annoying problems  
to this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 50 years from now  
this has not been done for obvious reasons , because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task  
columbus is the first to have crossed that line  
the result is , as you might imagine , primitive , unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort  
the world is simply frozen in time  
neither the society , fashion , culture or values have changed over 200 years  
mom is still working at the kitchen , doing the dishes  
when you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today , you'll see a slightly bigger difference  
i am not saying that everything should change  
it is unlikely that the human rights will change , but it's even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science , technology and fashion  
i suppose it's possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale , but it's really hard  
robin williams is hidden behind c and speaking in a robotic way  
as always he does a decent job , as does sam neill  
but it doesn't really matter  
it is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into a tiresome experience  
pretty much like last year's "" meet joe black "" , this is a primitive and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor and professionalism that it doesn't deserve  
great actors and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten  
when isaac asimov wrote this story , the future seemed far away and magical  
everything seemed possible  
now is the future of asimov's time , and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed a long time ago  
for the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius verne's "" 20 000 leagues under the sea "" , so can't we accept this story as a potential reality  
let us hope that next year's "" a "

 "" runners "" take bets from potential lottery winners and deliver them to private locations for drawings  
the undisputed leader of the harlem numbers is the madame queen ( cicely tyson ) who is challenged by dutch schulz ( tim roth ) , a ruthless hoodlum  
by turning against the queen , dutch defies his partner , the infamous lucky luciano ( andy garcia ) , who wishes to respect the queen and keep the peace  
the queens' army strengthens when an acquaintance , ellsworth "" bumpy "" johnson ( lawrence fishburne ) is released from prison and becomes a bodyguard for her  
he proves himself worthy in short time as he thwarts an assassination attempt ( on himself and the queen ) , and later takes control of the queens army when she is jailed for tax evasion  
bumpy's reign is not as restrained and subdued as the queen and he declares all out war on dutch  
bloody gang warfare ensues  
bumpy faces many obstacles during his reign  
his new army questions his methods  
his girlfriend ( vanessa l  williams ) and the queen disagree with his violent solutions  
most importantly ( in his eyes ) , dutch has become a more formidable foe than he imagined , and seeks help from lucky luciano to assassinate him  
there have been so many movies dealing with organized crime that it must be hard to write an original story dealing with it  
this movie is not original at all  
in fact , i was angered by how many similarities there was between this film and , arguably , the best gangster movie of all time , the godfather  
if you are going to borrow ideas from another movie and not give credit , why not borrow from a lesser known movie ( say , millers crossing ? )  
how could the credited screenwriter chris brancato not give credit to mario puzo himself ? 
here are just some of the major similarities ( i stopped counting at 10 )  
crooked cop assaults blood relative of the leader  
gang extracts revenge on crooked cop  
wife ( or girlfriend ) questions her partners' murderous activities and leaves him  
high ranking "" officer "" betrays the leader  
blood relative of the leader murdered  
war erupting between the "" families ""  
high-ranking officer disapproves of the leader in front of other family members  
new leader runs family differently from previous leader  
large meeting with all families involved  
the setup in this movie is done rather well  
i enjoyed the portrayal of the network of "" runners "" sprinting through the streets collecting bets for the queens lottery  
this was the way of life in harlem , and most people involved with the queen did so because it was the only way to support their families and put food on the table  
number running was the only way for the harlem population to find work  
i also enjoyed the interaction between the angry , violent dutch and the calm , patient lucky  
after about the 30-40 minute mark all of the similarities with the godfather start appearing , one after the other ( and in short order )  
it was a huge distraction , and an insult to my intelligence  
who was the screenwriter kidding here ? 
some of the individual performances were well done  
andy garcia was very convincing as lucky , unfortunately his screen time is reduced to a supporting role  
tim roth effectively plays the cocky villain , much like his roles in "" the cook , the thief , his wife and her lover "" and "" rob roy ""  
the good performances and convincing setup during the first third of the movie do not make up for the lackluster story that follows  
a couple of coincidences is one thing , over a dozen is an insult

-1,"i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple of interviews , and in both instances , he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon  
now , i personally remember those films as a ) starring a major motion picture star b ) being funny c ) having great action sequences d ) great chemistry e ) decent character development  
hmmm     okay    now on to my review of chill factor  
plot : a graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an ex-army general , to propose a nuclear device to international prospects  
when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps , they must keep it cool on ice , and rush it over to an army base , before the contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit , and kills millions of people  
critique : "" speed on an ice-cream truck "" is probably the pitch that was used to sell this one-tone movie to its backers , but unfortunately , the only way that anyone could compare this film to that tension-filled , original two hours of cinema , is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film , and the lethal weapon movies , stood for  
this film is seasoned in cliches , with plenty of badly written dialogue , over the top acting from cuba gooding jr  , zero chemistry between the two leads , and horribly tacky bad guys , tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe  
my friend and i enjoyed watching this movie to a certain extent , because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously "" written "" , that we just had to crack up  
that , and the formula for the film's script which followed the proverbial 1-2- , and you guessed it    3 scenario ! 
and what about all those catchy , hip names to get us to relate to the characters     "" elvis "" 
and "" nighshift "" , oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters ( and yes , it actually took two guys to come up with this regurgitated drivel )  
it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich and cuba gooding jr  got involved in this one-week-old-blue-cheese-smelling project  
did they actually think that it would boost their careers , or did they know that the script sucked , but discounted any fall from grace , knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall ? 
most probably the latter  
have you seen either fled or bulletproof ? 
well , despite the slight differences in plot , the essentials are basically the same here  
you get a black guy and a white guy being chased by a bunch of people , having no choice but to work together to get somewhere , hating each other at first , but over time , learning to respect one another as individuals

add to that , the fact that our film actually has bad guys who are all dressed in black , drive black cars and black vans , and run around with all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head  
not too conspicuous , eh ? 
call me a party-pooper , but as much as i like a nice cheezy movie as much as the next guy , this film just doesn't even try to do anything original or reasonably entertaining  
one cool scene with a boat careening down a mountainside , and another with a nuclear device obliterating everything on an island , do not a fun , buddy-action flick make  
show cuba the money , everybody !

-1,"plot summary : the year is 2024  
the ozone layer has long since gone and the earth is now protected from radiation by a shield invented by connor mccleod  
the shield , although saving lives , has made the atmosphere hot and humid  
connor is a mortal and a tired old man who has given up hope  
on returning from the opera one night connor is accosted by the leader of a "" terrorist "" organisation  
they have tried to find out what the company that now runs the shield unit are covering up  
connor is then attacked by two assassins sent by katana from the planet zeist ( like zeit--get it ? )  
they fail and connor becomes immortal again by chopping their heads off  
he then brings ramirez back to life in glencoe in scotland  
both ramirez and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment  
connor now has the option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found immortality and fight to find out about the company and the shield  
katana meanwhile , fearing connor would return , sets out himself to kill the highlander  
if you have never seen it  
being a fan of highlander and mr  connery , i was in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii : the quickening  
i wish it had been quicker  
i feel whatever else you can say about a film ( bad script bad music , etc  ) if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs to be said  
the film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so ( the time mr  connery is on the screen for ) is worth watching  
the plot sounds a little ridiculous but i was willing to give it a chance  
maybe they could pull it off  
instead , i find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first film  
it's as if they are different people with the same names  
witness connor jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance -- where is the attitude of "" who wants to live forever , when love must die "" gone to ? 
the love sub-plot * must * have had footage cut out  
the highlander and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before  
putting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying  
i still want to know why connor's coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal ! 
we are not given enough time on zeist to believe in it , nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill  
why not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck ? 
i know the head needs to come off but you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles first  
to be fair one assassin tried this but he must be the world's worst shot  
meanwhile connor develops luke-skywalker-like powers of laser beam deflection  
as for "" bad guys , "" we see a rebellion on zeist , crushed easier than a grape and then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist  
two assassins are sent , presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged connor kills them both with no problems  
no more assassins are sent  
katana , supposedly a very powerful man goes himself to kill connor  
has he no more assassins ? 
has he no better ? 
why was the rebellion crushed so easily then ? 
michael ironside is totally unconvincing ( bring back the kurgan )  
he seems like a cartoon character and really isn't that evil , just stupid and violent  
we see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening a child again and killing lots of innocents  
yet he still seems like no threat -- perhaps because he seems too stupid to threaten connor , or maybe because his two best assassins wouldn't have been amiss with larry , curly and mo  
so much for plot and characters  
the music is atrocious  
it is at best intrusive and at worst annoying  
bring back queen "

the garbage known as "" snuff "" films ? 
nothing , right ? 
what's to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography ? 
well    nothing  
so , why make it , hollywood ? 
there's no reason why the average , sane movie-goer will be interested in such a topic  
no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this  
the lack of quality filmmaking in "" 8mm "" ( from technical to acting ) stands out even more when you consider the star , writer , and supporting cast--all reputable  
but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again ! 
like paul schrader , schumacher has his moments , but they're few and far ( far ! ) 
between  
basically , this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it  
why not walk out ? 
well , this wouldn't be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie  
here's why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of "" 8mm ""    
first thing--if you don't heed my advice , then understand what you're about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud  
it's not easy to watch  
i didn't know the details of the story beforehand , but at least my ignorance can help others now  
the ( ha ! ) plot revolves around tom welles ( nicolas cage ) as a surveillance expert and private investigator  
a rich old woman discovers a "" snuff "" film in her late husband's safe  
she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl ( it had to be a young girl , didn't it , schumacher ! ) who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead  
she's horrified that her husband would have owned such a film ( in 8mm , of course ) and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find  
family-man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque "" murder ""  
let me backtrack for a moment  
see , "" snuff "" films are pornos with a violent twist--people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead  
however , the deaths are often staged and , in those cases , special effects and "" good "" acting make all the difference  
very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard-to-find movies  
the thought of this "" industry "" makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review , but i'll swallow my bile and move on  
welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry  
you'd think he's sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him ! 
he comes across smut clerk max ( joaquin phoenix ) who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze  
after a lot of digging and bribing , welles finds the men who are responsible for making this , and other , "" snuff "" films  
skip ahead , skip ahead , skip ahead    
led by dino velvet ( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance ) and star-torturer "" machine "" ( christopher bauer ) , they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue  
the movie doesn't end there , unfortunately , because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films do--become a vigilante  
this film doesn't draw you in  
it keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close ? 
it is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ( ie  
 "" se7en "" ) , but it takes a large measure of restraint ( schumacher has none ) and a larger amount of talent ( schumacher has little )  
by those jabs , i'm not only referring to his stylish destruction of the "" batman "" franchise , but "" a time to kill "" was an immensely overrated disappointment  
for a guy who gets so much studio money , his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled  
a good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter  
writer andrew kevin walker didn't recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for '95s twisted thriller , "" se7en ""  
director schumacher doesn't have that innate ability to make you watch things you don't really want to see like better directors are capable of doing "

trap a varied group of people on an isolated location , then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one  
these have been the successful ingredients for many good films ( the thing , alien , aliens , and tremors to name a few )  
so , why is it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad ? 
 ( see the relic for a particularly putrid example  ) 
perhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient : effort and ideas  
deep rising meets these two requirements part way , but not enough to salvage the film  
treat williams is finnegan , the leader of a small boat crew who hire out their services ( and their boat ) for any activity    no 
questions asked  
this time , however , they may have gone too far  
their passengers , led by the ominous wes studi , are the type of multi-national terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films  
and their cargo    let's 
just say it has very high explosive potential  
what is the target of these thieves ? 
why , the argonauticus , of course , a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage  
but something else is hunting the argonauticus    something 
ancient and deadly  
by the time the thieves arrive , nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed  
and now the creature senses fresh meat ! 
so , you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew , joining forces with the surviving passengers ( including the ship owner canton ( anthony heald ) , and a thief with less lofty goals , trillian ( famke janssen ) ) against the terror from the deep  
and the monster gets to pick them off one by one  
fortunately for the creature , this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer  
why else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food  
if there's a more clarion call for unity , i don't know what it might be  
it's pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when  
there are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the end  
for the most part , the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audience's impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first  
 ( although i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou's life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad  ) 
treat williams is a passable hero , and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation  
but while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy , very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way  
the biggest treat in the film , however , has to be pantucci , kevin j  o'connor's whining engine-boy , under finnegan's employ  
his constant quips may be a bit over-written , but they manage to capture the same vein of nerve-addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens ( or todd graff as hippie in the abyss , for that matter )  
it's just a stock part ( the comic-relief character ) , but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable  
as far as the monster goes , although the cgi is done well , the creature has no logical consistency  
think back to the great ( or even just good ) movie monsters  
they all had a set of "" rules "" about what they could do , and how and why they would do it  
part of the joy of those films was slowly discovering , along with the heroes , just what those rules are  
the tentacle monster in deep rising doesn't have a set of rules  "

or go rent body heat , to see william hurt do some real noir  
or even -- god help me -- palmetto  
alex proyas's new movie screams atmosphere  
i screamed , too , "" get me out of this theater ! "" 
new line cinema spent millions of dollars creating the expressionistic film noir visuals and paying the actors , and doesn't have any way to get it back  
i paid $4  25 for a matinee screening and don't have any way to get my money back , either  
you'll hear a lot from other critics about the look and feel of this movie  
i will admit that the cinematographers and costume designers and set artists and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create a stunning , nightmarish future world where it's always a late night in 1948 , complete with rotary phones and automats and fedoras  
i've got news for you fellows -- i don't care how hard you worked , or how visually stunning this movie looks -- you wasted your time and mine , working on a movie without a plot , without a clear sense of direction of where it wanted to go , without a soul or a reason to care  
the movie starts out oh-so-promising  
john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) is lying in a bathtub in the sort of seedy hotel that in real life , would have been boarded up long ago  
there is a dead , mutilated prostitute in the other room -- a surprise , as he has lost his memory  
the phone rings : it's a sinister-sounding man , claiming to be his doctor , telling him to flee for his life  
all well and good , right ? 
wrong  
apparently , someone decided that the audience was just a bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot  
 ( this is getting to be a popular assumption in hollywood  ) 
so , the actual beginning of the movie is not sewell running for his life , rather , it's a voice-over narration by the aforementioned doctor ( keifer sutherland ) explaining exactly what is going on and who is responsible  
it's as though sam the piano player had told us that rick and ilsa had been getting it on in paris in the first three minutes of casablanca  
no , wait , that's not fair to casablanca  
it's more like watching a new plotline at the first of the show -- or if you want to know how i really feel , having an off-screen narrator explain that gilligan won't be getting off the island in this episode  
>from here , the coherence of the plot goes down faster than ( insert monica lewinsky joke here )  
the characters just wander around the city aimlessly and bump into each other for no apparent reason , and that's what moves the plot  
what we're left with is a string of unanswered questions that don't make any sense  
we're given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers , yet they forget to use them at critical moments and get themselves killed  
we're given a hero who can "" tune "" into these same powers , yet he only uses them when it's convenient to the plot  
we're given a whole long list of loose ends that go nowhere 
usually , critics will say that an actor playing an underwritten part "" isn't given much to do  "" 
in this movie , no one is given anything to do  
sewell is given the impossible role of a man who doesn't remember anything , and plays it like    
um    
a man who doesn't remember anything  
the aliens are tall , pasty-faced , and bald , and wear long black cloaks and fedoras to remind us that they're evil -- and there's a child alien as well , straight out of an anne rice novel  
sutherland is saddled with a limp , a twitchy eye , and a breathy accent to remind us that he's in league with the aliens  
to its credit , dark city boasts two impressive bits of casting  
william hurt is perfectly cast as the world-weary inspector charged with catching the man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city  
jennifer connelly , playing sewell's love interest , is given two all-too-brief moments on screen as a lounge singer -- and turns in the sexiest performace this side of jessica rabbit  
but instead of the dogged policeman and the femme fatale given central treatment in the script ( the way they would be in any self-respecting noir movie ) they're almost tangiential to the plot , such as it is "
-1,"capsule : gal is a 50s-ish london cockney gangster who has retired to spain  
his old associates want him for one last job and send the vicious don to give him an offer he can't refuse  
a standout performance by ben kingsley as don cannot save what is essentially a set of cliches recycled from old westerns  
 , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 
roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , "" who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by    
ben kingsley ? "" 
my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it  
they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles  
the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious  
that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast  
gary "" gal "" dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain  
life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing  
but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch  
the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa  
the second punch comes from gal's past  
back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal  
he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal  
don will accept any decision gal makes from "" yes "" to "" certainly  "" 
however , if gal says "" no "" don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy's ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman )  
in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody's skin  
kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness  
there are some serious problems in louis mellis's and david scinto's script that should have been caught before filming  
when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success  
beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him  
any local hood could have done what gal is needed for  
additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault  
no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool  
in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar  
i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade  
the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability  
the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im  
it is not a great plot  
in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards  
perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film  
it is an old plot dressed up to look new  
if the plot is old , at least the style is creative  
this is director jonathan glazer's first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout  
his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences  
cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes  
we see one side of a person's faces  
but the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit  
half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden  
we yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog "
-1,
-1,"let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years  
i am not too fond of ted turner's world championship wrestling , however , and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight  
the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs ( david arquette , aptly cast as a neandrathal ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than a flashy show  
when they finally get to see their hero , wcw world champion jimmy king ( played by oliver platt  
i personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king ) , he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair ( a wasted palitaliano , in a role originally meant for real-life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later , and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff , they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it ) , they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his title back  
when they find him , they discover in horror that jimmy king's real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv  
king is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king  
after convincing king that they don't care that his persona isn't real , gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro , after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcw's pay-per-view  
gee , whiz , there are so many things wrong with this movie , i don't know where to begin  
yes , i do    
1  the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff , wcw president who thought up this project , thinks of wrestling fans  
he thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously  
he actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously  
i got news for you , eric : nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that , this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 ! 
i know he'll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn't meant to be taken seriously but it is , because that's how big an ego bischoff has  
2  there was a documentary made in 1998 , wrestling with shadows , that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation , vince mcmahon's screwing bret "" the hitman "" hart out of the title  
this movie's storyline is basically a comic rip-off of that plot with the poor man's wayne and garth thrown in  
eric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair , but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon , and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart  
3  
the movie's main wrestler , jimmy king , has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him  
no wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age , we want bad asses today ! 
4  why make this a comedy , instead of an emotional , rocky-style drama ? 
i know wrestling isn't a sport , but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end  
5  
in the movie , gordie starts up an ill-fated romance with nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan  
what she sees in that freak marilyn manson i'll never understand ) , only to find that she has hospitalized king's trainer for sinclair  
wouldn't it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy-girl-for-the-bad-guy cliche ? 
i hate that  
6  
last , but certainly not least , there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen , nor did i laugh once either  
the world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie , for these reasons : 
1  they're the better promotion  
2  they have better and younger talent , performers and wrestlers  
3  
they give their fans what they want and don't treat them like idiots  
4  they're winning the ratings and they're the promotion everybody cares about  
5  simply put , they could make a movie a hundred times better , and they could do a wrestling movie the right way  
the only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end  
and if i spoiled it for you , good , i saved you from wasting seven dollars "

-1,"the u  s  army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done  
one particular field manual is known as the fm 22-5 , which among other things , covers the practice of saluting  
under the "" saluting "" section is a sub-section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer  
the salute is rendered by the highest-ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail , and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail  
in any event , the salute is rendered only by the man ( or woman ) in charge , rather than by the whole group  
almost at the very beginning of the general's daughter , we see a general's motorcade passing a work detail  
everyone salutes  
it looked impressive , but it just wasn't right  
that little bit showed me that someone either didn't do the appropriate research , or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene  
in fact , this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture , as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie  
what results is a film that looks good , but like that one scene , just isn't right  
the first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example  
paul brenner ( john travolta ) is an agent for the army's criminal investigation division , undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale  
prior to the transaction , the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isn't the unscrupulous supply sergeant he's supposed to be , and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living  
so ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark ( we'll just say that it involves propellers )  
brenner then receives new orders when the commanding general's daughter , captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , is found naked , bound , and dead on one of the base's training ranges  
he is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder  
what i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary  
it gives no insight into brenner , other than the fact that he's a little cocky  
does the arms subplot turn up later ? 
no , so why add this extra running time to the film ? 
the answer : it looked cool  
or how about the "" atmosphere "" ? 
the beginning of the general's daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees , dirt roads , sultry colors over water - all backed up with bayouesque music  
nice immersion in the setting , but it soon doesn't matter , for when the film's plot shifts over to the murder investigation , so does the entire mood  
no attention is paid to the location of the story , and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme  
did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ? 
instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film , we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another , just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside  
the above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie  
as i've already mentioned , an entire section of the film doesn't jibe with the rest , and the characterization only adds to the difficulty  
brenner , who comes across as a man with little respect for authority , suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell ( james cromwell ) and utters some of the corniest "" yes , sir "" s i've ever heard  
he even delivers an emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general's daughter , even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous  
sunhill , who initially comes across as a professional investigator , utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information , and even revels in her ingenuity  
both characters are protagonists , but it's hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place , and in some cases , simply unappealing  
i could imagine that during filming , west would shoot a scene , then take the actors aside and tell them , "" let's do it again , but this time , i want more  "" 
i say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good , in this film they overact in most of their scenes  
an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general's aide , colonel fowler  
i swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention  
a far cry from his days as linc in "" the mod squad "" , i can't help but think he was acting from west's direction  
a couple of side characters including a west point psychologist ( john beasly ) and a young female private ( ariyan a  johnson ) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear  
the only two actors who seem to have escaped west's influence are james woods , who provides a good performance as colonel moore , elisabeth's mentor at the psychological operations unit , and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police  
woods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people's minds , and does so without ever taking it over the top

-1,"plot : a separated , glamorous , hollywood couple must pretend to reunite for a press junket of the last movie that they ever shot together  
kewl    now 
i only wish that i could pretend never to have seen this movie    
critique : trite , unfunny , boring and a waste of everyone's talent  
how a premise with such zest and bite can turn into a movie that doesn't feature any chemistry , any real laughs , any surprises or any spice is beyond me  
how julia roberts is used solely as a "" puppy dog "" character , puttering around in the background while we endure the complete bitchiness of zeta-jones' character , who is not one bit funny or romantic ( two ideal ingredients in a "" romantic comedy "" ) , is also beyond me  
and why they chose john cusack , a great , quirky actor in his own right , to play the most bland , uninteresting and unfetching character ( with zero chemistry with either of his leads ) is further more , beyond me  
and to anybody who decided that this project was "" funny "" enough to greenlight featuring the talents mentioned above , along with billy crystal , christopher walker , seth green and stanley tucci    well , 
what can i say    i 
just don't have the words  
so is this the worst movie that i've seen all year ? 
no  but it definitely sucks and it's basically because    well , 
it's just not funny  
and for the record , allow me to state a few more problems with it  
it starts off slow , it's got no energy , it doesn't engage you with any of its characters ( julia barely gets somewhat interesting in the film , everyone else    lame ! ) , it utilizes way too many flashbacks to move the story forward , it's utterly predictable , standard , routine , see-through and uninteresting as a plot and it just sits there on the screen , big and ugly , waiting    waiting for you to laugh or find something in it that is amusing  
and then hank azaria shows up    aaaaaah , the film's savior ( mind you , some might be offended by his exaggeration of a stereotype , but that's another story altogether )  
but when an experienced "" voice "" actor upstages all of the main stars in a summer "" blockbuster "" romantic comedy with an over-the-top antonio banderas accent , damn dude    your 
film's in trouble ! ! 
rent this movie on video just to see what went wrong yourself  
the references to ricky ricardo and senor wences ( huh ! ? ) , the idio-plot points like when one of the characters goes on the roof to stretch his arms out and relax , but everyone believes that he's going to kill himself ( hardy-har-har ) and the cheap way of getting the audience to leave the theater laughing by bringing back a ball-sniffing dog that has no place being in the location at the end of the movie , well    i 
could go on "

think of the plot as a rehash of sleeping with the enemy , and then rearrange the details and the gender of the stalker  
the finished product , although able to maintain the viewer's attention , is a predictable and unexciting thriller with an idiotic script  
`alex , i'll take homicide for $400    ' 
libby parsons ( ashley judd ) is a happily married mom leading a normal life  
one night , her husband nick ( bruce greenwood ) takes her out for a romantic escape on a sailboat  
libby awakens in the middle of the night to find she is covered in blood and nick has strangely disappeared  
she follows a trail of bloody footprints up to the deck , where she handles a fallen knife ( like any stupid character ) and is spotted by the coast guard , who are responding to a distress signal sent earlier in the evening  
nick is presumed dead , and although she pleads her innocence , libby is tried and convicted for the murder of her husband  
now , please don't think i'm spoiling any vital plot details , because the informative trailer has already spilled most of the beans  
if you haven't seen this preview , don't read any further  
but seriously , the inane screenplay by douglas weisberg and douglas s  cook is so elementary that the average viewer will be two or three steps ahead of the characters  
during the most vital scenes in the movie , i was anticipating every twist or `surprise' that eventually popped up on the screen  
i imagine the writers presume their core audience for double jeopardy is a very naive group of individuals  
most , unfortunately , will be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few positive aspects of the production  
one is tommy lee jones , who plays travis lehman , a parole officer given the tedious task of watching over libby after she serves her sentence in prison  
jones is always wonderful as an authority figure , and he's certainly familiar with this sort of role ( as he played so well in the fugitive and us marshals )  
judd , as a likable heroin with gusto , also has a chance to flex her acting abilities  
while emotionally unconvincing , the actress is tremendously fun in her juvenile role , perking up the movie like an injection of anti-depressant  
the actors , and their relationship together , present the one-two punch that prevents double jeopardy from derailing itself entirely  
and now , back to the plot  
while behind bars , libby learns an interesting little bit of information : a person can't be convicted of the same crime twice  
this law , called `double jeopardy' , could be her motive for hunting down her husband    
who may still be alive  
yes , you heard right  
the movie degenerates into a cross-country chase , where everything you expect to happen    
does  
the final scenes , which could have redeemed the film , are poorly handled by director bruce beresford - whose previous work centers highly around drama ( driving miss daisy , paradise road )  
ironically , it is those elements - like the driving force of libby to reunite with her son - that don't quite work here  
at least double jeopardy is paced well enough to satisfy diehard fans of the two stars  
unfortunately , jones lacks some of the edge that he had as sam gerard in the fugitive , and the real depth of his character is only skin deep  
but he and ashley judd are more than welcome considering the material , and both have some memorable comic moments  
judd , in particular , has a hilarious scene in which she wards off an oncoming male by explaining she has to check in with her `parole officer'

-1,"lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4 : episode 1 is a boring , empty spectacle that features some nice special effects  
after the familiar 'a long time ago     ' 
opening , the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game  
the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo , ruled by queen amidala ( portman ) jedi knights qui-gon ( neeson ) and obi wan ( mcgregor ) are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade  
however , this simple blockade is not all it seems , and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers , including facing the evil darth maul ( ray park  ) 
they also meet the future darth vadar , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) 
star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking : script , direction and characters  
the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic  
the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star , and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non-existent  
there's no underlying tension , and no urgent need to see what the outcome is  
the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story , which doesn't help  
there's no snap to make the film work , it moves at a plod  
the script is boring : all the characters speak in morals , especially anakins mother  
there's no group spirit evident here , and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders , it's evident that not much is going to happen  
the two leads are hideously boring , static characters given little to do and too much time to do it  
qui-gon and obi-wan hold no presence on film , and give little for the audience to root for  
the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul , if he had been given more screen time  
maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history , even if he does provide the only 'straight' plot line in the film ( all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy  ) 
anakin is annoying and unlikeable  , 
instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended  
it's probably not surprising that his hateful little boy , unfortunately blessed 'ani' by everyone he knows , joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible  
the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks , although in the end none is provided in the film by him  
although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys , the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny  
the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a 'pod' racer , because i knew he wouldn't be able to talk for a while  
queen amidala is a nothing in the film , she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must 'serve her people , ' and go goo-goo over anakin  
again , her role will become more important in the later episodes , and is given little to do here  
the actors don't help the movie much either  
liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed , and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible  
mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy , with little charm  
the casting director must have chose him because he's scottish like alec guinness : there's little other explanation for it  
natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script , but she delivers a spunky performance  
and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice  
there's very little talent evident with him , it's hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there  
he's not even very 'cute  ' 
the main claim of the film , the special effects , are okay  
there's nothing impressive about them , yet they complement the story well  
the cgi takes away much of the human element , however  
the battle droids for example , the replacement for the stormtroopers , are characterless little computer graphics , lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers  
episode 1 is just disappointing  
it's got high production values , but little else  
the music is meandering , except near the end "

my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program  
true , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it's a cartoon  
but it's a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen  
but my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ? 
turns out i was right , mostly  
inspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick  
at first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver  
this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where "" formula "" isn't just business , it's a way of life  
the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits  
in some parts you can just hear them saying "" more zany ! 
i want more zany here -- and -- here  "" 
 "" let's have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful  
i want the audience squirming in their seats  "" 
 "" ok , that's fine , but i want you to add bug guts  "" 
 "" what does this scene do ? 
character depth ? 
but where's the zaniness ? 
i don't see zany here  
if you can't make it zany , cut it ! "" 
the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie  
michelle ( who plays penny , gadget's niece ) shines in every scene she's in , but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time  
my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor  
dabney coleman's comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby  
i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes  
he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the "" gidget bitch from hell "" town mayor  
oteri's overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon's own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn't poking fun at our fair town  
or , maybe all career politicians are like that  
i must say , matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla  
he appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget  
rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw  
joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself  
her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film  
d  l  hughley plays the shuckin'-and-jivin' vehicular side-kick , in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years  
the dialog is    let's face it , it's pretty bad  
the tag-line after a major set-piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context  
a lot of the lines ( especially hughley's ) appear to be made up as they go along , by people with little gift for ad-lib  
about three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw  
gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations ( not really "" battles "" ) with the evil gadget  
penny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon  
let me rage here just for a minute  
michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character  
she's utterly charming , and has excellent experience ( harriet the spy ) for the part of the pint-size detective  
why she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery "

-1,"this movie is based off the wildly popular video-game series of the same name  
before this film , the game had a few spin-off cartoons- which were ok  
but the idea of doing a movie is insane  
it should have been animated , if it should have been done at all  
instead the people do the best they can with a talented cast  
yet it still fails  
the plot is completely different from the game's plot- i'm not complaining about that  
the story involves the mario bros  having a plumbing business in brooklyn and having to compete with a rival company  
eventually they find a construction site by their nemesis , which happens to be enviromentally un-safe  
so , due to luigi's ( john leguizamo ) girlfriend - princess daisy - they go and investigate  
they get transported to a blade runner-esque world lead by king koopa ( dennis hopper )  
somehow a plot dealing with all the dinosaurs being mutated and transported to an alternate futuristic mega-city jumbles in  
the plot is fine- better than the movie deserves  
the acting is ok  
this seems to be more of a visual film  
the special effects are good , especially on the robotic yoshi  
however the film drags and is no fun  
and it leaves itself open to a sequel , which probably won't ever be made  
this movie begins sort of promising , but ends up leaving a weird taste in your mouth  
so if you want to watch a sort of odd movie starring the excellent dennis hopper , then watch super mario bros  : 
the movie  
you could do worse  
but you could definitely do better    
  
street fighter : the movie ( 1995 ) starring : raul julia and jean claude van-damme 
this movie was based off of a series of never ending sequels to a game called street fighter 2  it has all the characters from the game in a reasonable plot  
it is more like a "" movie "" than it should be  
yes , it's watchable  
raul julia does a good job , considering this was his final film  
while the game had non-stop fighting sequences , this movie is a hodge-podge of action scenes and flashy sets and costumes while trying to show off a plot at the same time  
does it work ? 
sort of    
the plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by m  bison ( raul julia )  
guile ( jean claude van-damme ) takes his troops to attack bison's main base in an attempt to liberate the innocent villages he has taken over  
in a short amount of time , the movie introduces several characters well  
it catches your attention  
but it ultimately seems like a showcase for fans of the game so you can point out things like "" there's chun li ! ! "" 
or "" look at that fire-ball ryu did at vega ""  
it hits the bases by presenting the characters in a plot with good sets , but goes no further "

battlefield earth 
a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman 
in my mid-teen years , i had a horrendous re-occurring nightmare  
behind the wheel of a car , i was driving down a straight road in the middle of a desert  
no scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway  
no matter what i did , the view didn't change : travelling but not getting anywhere  
each time i awoke in a sweat , terrified  
you don't have to be carl jung to understand that dream  
powerless to make changes , trapped in a boring situation with no hope of rescue , this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake  
this is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after "" battlefield earth "" begins  
for all of its flash and style , l  ron hubbard's science fiction epic is the earliest and best entry for the dullest summer film of 2000  
dull "" and "" stupid  
in the year 3000 , the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for 1 , 000 years  
humans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as barbarians  
there's no hope  
the future is bleak  
then the psychlo make a mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry pepper ) who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl ( john travolta ) and the alien race  
it's an archetypal post-apocalyptic plot full of promise  
considering some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen , it's difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably  
but it does  
the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits  
are we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold , the psychlo never discovered fort knox ? 
or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time -- and gassed up ? 
or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships ? 
or that the psychlo spy cameras somehow don't notice that their slaves are missing for days ? 
travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he's worth and is almost entertaining  
almost  
the rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person -- "" man-animal "" or not -- would ever utter  
some of the film _looks_ good , but it also looks so familiar  
a race of large hulking ape-like creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin  
sound like something charlton heston might be in ? 
the psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from "" dune ""  
the final air battle between the air force fighters and the psychlo ships in their high-tech city is something george lucas might have been associated with  
it's too loud  
it's too oppressive  
it's too slow  
it's too long    far 
too long  
and on it goes  
the list of the problems with "" battlefield earth "" is endless  
it's difficult to find anything in the film that does work  
oh yeah  
the color scheme is nice  
the real question is how this movie ever got made  
could it have something to do with the fact that l  ron hubbard was the founder of scientology ? 
and that john travolta is a member of the church  
that might explain why travolta bought the rights to the novel years ago "

-1,"godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the "" who cares about plot "" summer movie  
a loose remake of the 1954 "" classic "" japanese monster movie , godzilla , king of the monsters ( which is itself pretty thin in the story department ) , roland emmerich and dean devlin's big-budget lizard-stomps-manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind  
the script isn't just "" dumbed down , "" it's lobotomized  
godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone  
presumably , the primary target group for this film is teenage boys , the demographic most likely to shell out $7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster-instigated carnage  
that's not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction ; they're just not as readily susceptible  
this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer-generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors  
stargate was a financial success  
independence day was a runaway hit  
and , with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie-ins before it even opens , it's virtually guaranteed at least $100 million  
nice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not-too-precocious grade school kid  
godzilla isn't completely without merit , although it is close  
there's a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan , but it wears off quickly  
frankly , while the special effects are competent , they're not all that stunning  
there's nothing new here ; it's jurassic park meets aliens , with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure  
maybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer-generated visuals to the next level  
godzilla never really pushes the envelope , preferring to remain within a comfort zone  
the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass , formulaic approach which disallows creativity  
 ( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival ? ) 
worst of all , godzilla isn't even exciting  
with the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end , there isn't a sequence in this film that raises the pulse  
even the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn-provoking  
independence day may have been dumb , but it was full of "" adrenaline moments "" capable of getting the audience involved in the action  
in this aspect of its production , as in so many others , godzilla is lacking  
actually , part of the problem is that we're never sure who we're supposed to be rooting for : the green monster with an attitude or the paper-thin humans trying to stop him  
the plot , such as it is , can be summed up rather simply  
after sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands , godzilla shows up in the big apple  
he does some of the usual tourist things : stops by madison square garden , visits the chrysler building , goes on a walk through central park , and takes the subway  
in the process , he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs , but he never has trouble with traffic jams  
on hand to stop him is an elite u  s  army unit , led by a slightly less-arrogant-than-usual military man ( kevin dunn ) and a biologist named nick tatopoulos , who has a theory about godzilla  
in his opinion , the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific  
in nick's words , godzilla is "" a mutated aberration ? an incipient creature ? the first of its kind  "" 
as luck would have it , nick's old girlfriend , audrey ( maria pitillo ) , is a reporter based at a new york tv station  
along with her cameraman friend , animal ( hank azaria ) , she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla  
then , just when the military has rejected nick's theory about why godzilla is in new york , a member of the french secret service ( jean reno ) recruits him for a special assignment  
instead of stomping around tokyo this time , godzilla has chosen new york city  
unfortunately , manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies ( independence day , deep impact , armageddon ) that it's becoming boring  
the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong , but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall  
he could climb the empire state building  
at ten times that height , godzilla would be more likely to knock it over  
godzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor  
there's an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sit-com material , an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick's last name properly , and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel "

when something goes wrong and one of the presence's recent victims escapes , the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is a threat that needs to be stopped  
they enlist the help of alison ( ramona midgett ) , a recent suicide victim , to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the nether-realm  
her mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was , an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed  
the king's sorcerer , amblyn ( who also lost his job ) , decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice  
during the downtime in his unemployment , amblyn decided to create a new dimension where sorcery , evil , and torture ruled  
abraham wished to follow his master into this new realm , so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love  
in this new realm , amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm  
after each murder , abraham would become stronger , until his power surpassed that of amblyn's  
because of the screw-up that allowed the recent escape , abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself  
as alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways , the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered

this film is essentially an 80 minute stalk-and-slash film ( following the dante's inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6 ) intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and ( supposedly ) haunting images , many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot  
if there aren't bizarre images floating past the screen , then we get pointless shots of a suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at a time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone  
compelling , but ultimately not  
the opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images  
the credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesn't pop up until near the end of the sequence  
when the opening credits began i thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and a interstitial from mtv2 had found its way to my tv  
at least the music in the film is pretty decent , made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features a song by ramona midgett  
at the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them ( and he talks like a darth vader clone without the heavy breathing )  
for some reason though , he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance  
one over-alled cretin handles the presence's gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel , then there's an inbred father ( dwight spurgin ) and his two inbred children ( mark kettler and jennifer poirrier-wallace ) that take care of a young woman who has been transformed into a half dog-half human mix with a shotgun , and of course a big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds  
why would you want to give responsibilities to a bunch of "" rednecks "" when you yourself had all of these cool powers ? 
and how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time ? 
i can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment  
the most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging/salting sequence  
the character in question , dana ( angela zimmely ) , has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated  
a priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken  
he picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken , taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever  
when she starts to leave , the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life , walks out , and makes like it wants to be crucified by her  
the presence starts to clap annoyingly ( which continues for the rest of the sequence ) until dana takes off with the strange creature following her  
when it finally catches up to her , she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ  
the box for the film claims "" because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture , parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18  
contains nudity and graphic violence ""  
while both is certainly true , there doesn't seem to be much of either in any large amounts  
besides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump , a semi-graphic self-surgery scene , and two instances of head trauma ( one run over and one melting ) , most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety  
as for nudity , it is very sparse , but at least we get to see angela zimmerly ( far and away the most attractive cast member ) before her body is bruised , torn , and bloodied by the dragging incident  
ice from the sun has been released on vhs by www  b-movie  com  
it has been presented in in full-frame only and the transfer ( for a film shot a good deal in 8mm ) is pretty decent "

-1,"wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic proportions  
over black and white drawings , we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange , sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiation-induced mutation  
the "" original "" inhabitants of the earth , fairies and elves , return to populate the globe , along with their evil , mutant counterparts  
one day ( and i say "" one day "" not to be trite , but because that's exactly how it happened - no advance notice ) , a fairy queen gives birth to twins , one good and one evil  
the twins grow up to be powerful wizards , the good one embracing magic , and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire  
we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology  
as unoriginal as the premise is , i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out  
there's a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world , after all  
i soon learned , however , that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film  
once the transition was made from still art to color animation , an entirely different feel takes precedence  
rather than the epic saga promised by the narration , we get a goofy-looking world of a saturday morning cartoon  
not just the look , mind you , but all the zany sounds like >honk boing 
for years , blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good , since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined  
however , blackwolf now has a secret weapon : nazis  
yup , adolf hitler , the luftwaffe and the wehrmacht  
okay , not the real things , but an archival film his minions dug up  
projected into the sky for all to see , it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up  
before you know it , there are dead elves everywhere  
this is just as well  
the characters are so bad that the viewer doesn't care about any of them  
they're either silly , sappy , or both  
the dialog gets much of the credit for this  
an example is when avatar nonchalantly says , "" well , looks like my brother and i begin our final battle  "" 
not very formidable when he's also the guy who says , "" this is the biggest bummer of a trip i've ever been on  "" 
my favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can't fight back against the nazi-charged evil  
her response is , "" they have weapons and technology  
we just have love  "" 
suffice to say , the characters are strictly two-dimensional , and we therefore don't expect anything more than the obvious to happen  
which it does  
the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out , which is anticlimactic and disappointing  
please note that it is the action that is unexpected  
that it is disappointing is not  
the film couldn't settle on a particular mood  
it seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle  
scenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity  
the dramatics , which seem to occur at random , are overly staged and overly acted , detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned  
ralph bakshi , the director , makes an obvious attempt to get a message across in this film : hitler and the nazis were bad  
so who doesn't know this already ? 
well , maybe children  
okay , so you might say that this is a movie for children  
it's not  
in the scenes where good fights evil , there's a lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if they're watching a cartoon  
so is the film for adults ? 
if so , we probably don't need to be bashed over the head to get the point  
why not have the bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instead of using old propaganda in a seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know ? 
wizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks and airplanes , and hitler giving speeches  
however , we don't see any reason why they should be considered bad "

-1,"keep cool , a chinese film directed by semi-accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang , was one of the kickoff films for this year's hawaii international film festival  
on the day it premiered , lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block , some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater  
they need not have wasted their time  
the movie is billed as a comedy , but is surprisingly bereft of humor  
there are noticeable attempts at laughs , but very few tries actually click  
i wondered if there were jokes that i wasn't getting because i'm not from china , but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn't be attributed to the cultural barrier either  
keep cool just isn't very funny  
the prelude to the film was a visit by keep cool's producer who , with the help of an interpreter , regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time , an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii  
although the print made it , the assistant's luggage was lost  
too bad that story wasn't in the movie , because it got a big laugh  
qu ying , the film's female lead , was also on hand to give a few comments  
however , whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed , ms  ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one , fast-paced , incredibly long tirade  
it was dizzying ; good foreshadowing for the film  
you see , keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes  
at least that's the way it seems , since the camera is constantly moving  
cinema verite is one thing , but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another  
although some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing , i found it thoroughly distracting , and after a while , quite annoying  
headache , as i said  
the film is about a young bookseller ( wen jiang ) who is after a young woman ( qu ying )  
they used to be romantically involved , but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship  
the first half of the film is about the young man's plan to win her back  
of course the thing is , she doesn't want to be won back , and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit  
in the fight , the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker , but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost  
we later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced  
there is a funny scene ( the only one in the film ) where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner ( baotian li ) in order to recoup his losses  
there is no sense to be made out of the young woman's behavior ; cold one minute , caring the next , so we feel no sympathy for her character  
the bookseller would be better off without her  
although the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well , who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner's hand as revenge for the beating he took , it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man  
while the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge , the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation  
his quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with , but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time  
a friendship develops between the two men , but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate  
although only an hour and a half in length , keep cool contains extraneous material  
the whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out , since we don't see her from the midpoint on  
a case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner , and would have saved us from the bookseller's boring pursuit during the first half  
but of course , this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour  
there are a few things that keep cool does right  
as mentioned before , the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good  
although it grows tiresome , the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic , and represents the differences in thinking between generations  
in one scene , for example , the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across , but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted , and that it means something entirely different  
also effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene , such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner  
the nightclub owner is counting out money , slapping each bundle of currency on the table  
with every shot of his hand , we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge "

-1,"when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions , i turned to my friend and said , "" dangerous liaisons for kids ! "" 
it was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense , owing everything it is to stephen frears' 1988 masterpiece  
imagine my surprise to see that writer/director roger kumble has given credit to his source material : choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits  
and i was impressed  
in fact , i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film , which is an appalling excuse for a movie  
it's kiddie-porn hackwork , complete with earthy sex-talk and fully-clothed hand-jobs  
i suppose this kind of movie was inevitable ; with all the teen high-school angst movies coming out , there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they're smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined  
cruel intentions is a mess in every possible way , and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to : i hated all the characters , and i hate everything they do  
i also hate ryan phillippe , so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be  
phillippe plays ( check out this name ) sebastian valmont  
wow  
isn't that a memorable name ? 
i could just say it over and over again  
sebastian valmont  
it kind of rolls off the tongue , in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich  
sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no woman he can't have , no material object out of his reach  
he has all the money , all the sex -- all at his fingertips  
and , luckily , his parents never enter into his life -- no , in the world of cruel intentions , adults don't really exist  
the ones who do are irritating  
sebastian valmont lives with his stepsister , kathryn merteuil ( sarah michelle gellar ) , the bitch-queen of the universe , and also the woman every man wants  
since these two rich kids are so bored , they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons  
kathryn wants sebastian valmont to de-virginize cecile caldwell ( selma blair ) , a naive dork-chick who has somehow wronged kathryn  
but it's too easy for sebastian valmont -- he wants to nail annette hargrove ( reese witherspoon ) , the "" paradigm of chastity and beauty  "" 
so , sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal ( which is too explicit to state here )  
but -- dear god ! 
-- sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove  
dangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable , and because of its masterful acting  
cruel intentions is bad for many reasons , but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting  
kathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch , a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her  
she is supposed to be mean , but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons  
gellar , while aesthetically pleasing , is one-dimensional and utterly repulsive  
witherspoon has a truly beautiful face , but her character isn't the moral staple she's supposed to be : sure , she won't have sex until she's in love ( is this really a * moral * issue ? ) , but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible  
but i can't forget mr  phillippe , who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable , invulnerable blandness  
i have to give him credit and say that he did , in fact , manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions  
and there's one point in the film in which he shouts , thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone  
true , he is bad , but it doesn't help that he has no character to work with  
kumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character , leaving us with a sex-crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch  
the film fails in every other way , too  
first of all , nobody talks like this  
even the "" intellectuals "" i know don't bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering  
for a while , the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs , but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there's no way we can join it  
cruel intentions also manages to come off as soft-porn in more than one scene  
earlier i mentioned a fully-clothed hand-job ; this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont , both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie  
so , if we hate them , then what's the point of an extended sex scene ? 
titillation , of course  
it can't even work under the pretense of "" meaningful love scene , "" because we hate the characters "

-1,"over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind's nuclear testing  
partly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo  
a year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr  
as godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world  
thirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985  
now it's 14 years after toho's remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run  
in emmerich's godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr  niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation-induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms  
when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states  
meanwhile , tatopoulos's college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big-time news reporter  
she'd like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break  
of course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor "" animal "" palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey's trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place  
together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla  
with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation's premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla  
he didn't  
right up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history  
the plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur-like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it's up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down  
the script , however , is painfully bad  
it's fraught with lines so corny , they don't even belong in b-movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , "" you idiot , "" or "" you stupid girl  "" 
i suppose when you've got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well  
why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ? 
why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ? 
why do sidewinder missiles , which have small explosive warheads , blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla ? 
why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f-18 fighter-bombers , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ? 
okay , maybe the last one was a bit nit-picky , but hey , i was on a roll  
broderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he's weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way  
hank azaria does what he can , but don't expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage  
like broderick's , azaria's character is quite simply lacking in color  
what really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting  
casting must have been asleep on this one  
the one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we've seem him do in the past  
although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable  
unfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities  
the entire feel of the movie is tongue-in-cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it  
this results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess  
most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously  
although emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ? 
if we can't take the characters seriously , the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don't care what happens to them  
godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light-hearted than it should be  
far be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters , but here's a behemoth running through the city ! 
there's bound to be a lot of casualties , but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after-school g  i  
joe cartoon syndrome , where almost everyone seems to get out of harm's way just in time  
in a couple of scenes , godzilla briefly breathes fire  
none of the characters even remark upon this ability , nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers  
it's as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes , godzilla can do this , just like in the old movie  
consider another punch pulled  
through creative script writing , you can make a sequel out of just about any movie , but the final scene in this one doesn't just leave the door open , it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently  
it made me want to gag "

-1,"the original _babe_ was my favorite movie of 1995 , a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience  
being a surprise commercial and critical success , it had no marketing tie-ins , which limited its final take  
thus , babe 2 arrives , with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1  
plush dolls , vending machines hawking t-shirts , and macy's thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday money-grubbing  
too late  
this is a sad review to write , because babe 2 not only does _not_ live up to the original , but it doesn't even come to a fraction of it  
i shouldn't expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors' magic , but this film tries too hard , and loses its charm  
consider a driver applying the accelerator with great intensity , unaware that his car is in neutral  
imagine with me , if you will , _scream_'s jamie kennedy , explaining the "" rules "" for sequels like babe 2  
 ( 1 ) there must be _more_ talking animals  
 ( 2 ) there must be _more_ slapstick comedy  
 ( 3 ) there must be _more_ songs for those mice to sing : that's cute  
 ( 4 ) keep the story cards to break up the action : that's cute too , even though "" the pig gets wise "" made no sense , given the context of that story partition  
 ( 5 ) there must be action , however illogical , that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original : the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to , the baa-ram-ewe secret code , the "" that'll do , pig  
that'll do  "" 
now throw in the limitations : ( a ) james cromwell , now a hot commodity , has limited time on the set ( or maybe he didn't approve of the script )  
 ( b ) christine cavanaugh , the voice of the original babe , demands more money ( $200 , 000--paltry considering the $80 million budget )  
out  
e  g  
daily comes in with noticable results  
 ( c ) george miller , the director , is more well-known for his dark futuristic mad max films and his twilight zone segment , not for kiddie fare ( and no , he didn't direct that _andre_ film in '94 )  
 ( d ) the special effects are impressive , _but limited_  
babe talks , but most of the time from a single shot , repeated over and over again  
 ( babe is center screen , looking straight into the camera , with a happy smirk--regardless of whether he's happy , or scared , or tired )  
season now with the "" original "" elements , which , as we will find out , are straight from the screenwriting-is-hell bin  
 ( i ) change the venue into "" the big city ""  
this has been praised as wildly original  
excuse me : didn't _home alone_ do this several years ago ? 
how about the muppets ? 
even _the bad news bears_ travelled to tokyo  
sorry  
no dice  
side note : to give the city a fairy-tale look , george miller crafted a fantastical fantasyland that merges the landmarks of the world's great cities , and yes , it _is_ impressive  
but this too is over-used , repeating the same view over and again on multiple occasions  
and , for the most part , babe _remains in the hotel_  
 ( ii ) given the limitations of cromwell , the human element is taken over by "" the boss' wife "" played by magda szubanski  
s-t-r-e-t-c-h  
she's not a lead actress-type , she's not funny enough in her physical comedy , and she's simply embarrassing in some of her pratfalls  
 ( have her arrested falsely on drug charges ! 
have her accidentally incite a riot with biker dudes and scantily clad babes ! 
have her bounce around on a bungee cord at a prestigious benefit dinner ! ) 
i was hoping for a little smirk during these scenes , but i felt sorry for the embarrassment that she put herself in  
i am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film , the violence , the scene where a pit bull dangles from the bridge , head submerged underwater  
even the best fairy tales have a bit of the macabre in it , as the brothers grimm have demonstrated

-1," "" marie couldn't talk , "" paulie , the parrot star of his own movie , tells us about the daughter in his original family  
 "" dad couldn't listen  
and mom couldn't cope , so they got rid of me  "" 
paulie , the autobiography of a talking , not merely a mimicking , parrot , has jay mohr in the lead role of the bird - the voice , not the body - and as the minor character of benny , a small-time crook who uses paulie to pull off small scams like stealing twenties from atms  
as the parrot , mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut up  
benny , on the other hand , is a character you've seen a thousand times before , and mohr brings nothing new to that role  
roberts's deliberately slow pacing of laurie craig's script lends a subtle sweetness to its humor but creates some definite problems  
when a kids' movie wants to mosey along , watch out  
if the material is not crisp and perfectly composed , beauty can sometimes dissolve into tedium  
so it is with paulie  
when they let their bird do his stand-up comedy routines , the show hums and the audience roars  
too often , however , a sleepy silence ensues among the viewers as they wait for the story to pickup again  
tony shalhoub , the smart-mouthed chef from big night , plays misha , a recent russian immigrant to the u  s  he had been a teacher of literature at home , but now he makes his living as a janitor in the animal research lab to which paulie has been taken for study  
although misha gets a few nice lines ( "" i'm russian  
i like long stories  "" ) , 
his somber part seems designed only to elicit our sympathy  
besides paulie , the only character worth noting - other than 2 cute small parts played by cheech marin and gina rowlands - is the speech-impaired marie , played in a precious performance by cinematic newcomer , 5-year-old hallie kate eisenberg  
naturally enchanting , she gives the picture genuine heart  
the bad news is that her part is confined to the first half  
the best scenes have the bird dancing and strutting to show off his comedic skills  
when marie's family gets a cat , for example , the bird , who hasn't wanted to learn how to fly until then , takes an instant interest in soaring  
tricking the cat while insulting him at the same time , paulie calls him a stupid hairball  
their rapid physical antics add to the humor of the situation  
it's good quality sitcom material but performed by animals  
when one of the humans without much of a voice begins to sing , paulie cringes  
 "" i'm a bird , "" he explains with his frequently subtle humor  
 "" i have a small brain , and it's about to explode  "" 
the movie contains rich doses of john debney's dreamy music  
with heavy use of a solo violin , he keeps reinforcing the film's heart-warming themes  
and when paulie finally takes off in flight , the orchestra comes up loud and strong with cymbals clashing  
 "" it's a long story , "" says paulie  
 "" it's the only kind he knows , "" reflects misha  
and the motion picture , which runs the standard length for a kids' movie , still feels too long  
the best parts are enthralling , but then there are all of those dead spots in-between  
paulie is a movie that never quite lives up to its promise but manages to charm nevertheless  
paulie runs 1 : 32  
it is raged pg for a few mild profanities and would be fine for all ages  
my son , jeffrey , age 9 , gave the movie * * with his biggest complaint being that there wasn't enough action  
he thought paulie was funny , and the actress that played marie was quite good  
his friend sam , almost 9 , thought the movie was "" awesome , excellent , "" and gave it * * * *  
he thought paulie was good , but he didn't believe the way marie's speech impediment was acted "

director : luis mandoki 
screenplay : gerald di pego ( from the novel by nicholas sparks ) 
cast : kevin costner , robin wright-penn , paul newman , illeana douglas , robbie coltrane , jesse james , john savage  
review by : geoff berkshire 
i'm not an overly cynical guy  
there have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years  
however , i have my limits and i also have standards  
this brings us to the subject at hand : message in a bottle , the big ticket romance that warner brothers' unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentine's day  
the story , what little of it that there is , involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne ( robin wright-penn ) dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason ( jesse james )  
during a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean  
the letter , written to a mystery woman named catherine , instantly captivates her  
upon her return , theresa shares it with her best friend lina ( illeana douglas ) , her boss charlie ( robbie coltrane ) , and the entire city of chicago ( the newspaper publishes an article about it )  
it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake ( kevin costner ) and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down  
he turns out to have a colorful father ( paul newman ) but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing  
this is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship  
of course she doesn't tell him that she found his letter , she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later ( preferably right after they first make love )  
this way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened  
the discovery of the message and garret's discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film  
there's a truly lame subplot about garret's relationship with his dead wife's family ( he gets into a bar fight with her brother , played by john savage ) and then the necessary tear-jerking ending  
a fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die , although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel  
the actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced , and unintentionally humorous , sequences filmed since    
well , since costner's the postman ( 1997 )  
message in a bottle is one slow moving film  
last year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe black but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this  
they also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work  
message in a bottle has a decent enough cast but they're fighting the material all the way , and losing badly  
costner and , especially , wright-penn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring  
they also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry  
the supporting players are given very little to do  
the reliable douglas is particularly wasted  
old pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film  
a confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played  
however , too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are  
the film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works to undercut the story  
gabriel yared , who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient ( 1996 ) and city of angels ( 1998 ) with his scores , overdoes it a bit here  
caleb deschanel's camera makes everything look a little too beautiful  
do the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly ? 
the editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times  
the real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego  
working from a best- selling novel by nicholas sparks ( which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county ) , di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times  
its strict adherence to clich ? s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer ( 1998 )  
there simply isn't an original scene in this film  
the dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking  
this is director mandoki's first film since when a man loves a woman ( 1994 ) , the solid meg ryan/andy garcia romance  
he's simply going through the motions with this "

with the millenium just around the corner , hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century  
this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil  
the result is somewhat predictable  
i didn't have high hopes about arnold's "" much anticipated "" return to the big screen  
schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased , action lovers won't be bored , and the catholic league will be angry  
everyone else will see 'end of days' for what it is : a deliciously bad motion picture  
think of it as hollywood's own y2k bug  
did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you'll get 999 , as in 1999 ? 
yes , you better believe it   satan is here on earth , working on his latest project -- the end of days  
this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and , although not al pacino , he is fun to behold  
he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker , wreaking , as they say , havoc  
the way it works is he smirks and something explodes  
before the stroke of the new millennium he's got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations  
only schwarzenegger's cop attached to an anti-terrorist unit can stop him  
films like this has one serious weakness -- logic  
no matter how you twist the "" plot "" , you'll find it incredibly stupid ( even for a schwartzenegger movie ! )  
the incredible fact is that such directors never learn  
after thousands of headless productions , this theme has become one big clich ?  
here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution  
he is walking around n  y  , blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius  
all he wants is the girl , that is somehow special  
but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks , he has hidden her in a church , where satan dare not enter  
so the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information : "" you can have your wife and daughter back   i 
can give you happiness that you can only dream of   just 
give me the address   "" 
indeed with a script like that , you could make a wonderful parody , but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously , attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller  
and for you who have awaited arnold swartzenegger's comeback , will not be very satisfied  
we've not seen him in a while  
that's because he didn't have a worthy opponent  
he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars  
he has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop  
so , after all those fights , what's left for arnold schwarzenegger ? 
how about satan ? 
in my opinion , he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in cameron's "" terminator ""  
and that is schwartzenegger's strength -- muscles and no emotions  
here he tries to achieve an artistic level , moving towards the oscar  
this is called "" an adult turn "" if successful and "" a flop "" if unsuccessful "

i can't help but feel like everyone is looking at me  
it's as if all the audience is gazing at the back of my head in the darkness , eyes shooting daggers , quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hard-earned money to spend their time watching this    
this    
thing  
i shift uncomfortably in my seat  
i'm reminded of how i feel when i see a pair of second- or third-rate celebrities engaging in a teleprompted "" funny "" conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award  
it's not my fault , i know it's not my fault , but dammit , someone's gotta be embarrassed , because it doesn't look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame  
i'm about to give you a list of names of people who are gonna make a movie together : garry shandling , annette bening , john goodman , greg kinnear , mike nichols  
do any of these names make you instantly shudder ? 
the answer i would have come up with before today is no , this is quite a list of talented individuals we've got here  
granted , john goodman was in the flintstones , and greg kinnear has turned in some less-than-lackluster leading man performances in certified failures like a smile like yours , but even so , they've got proven power as excellent supporting players  
garry shandling has two television classics under his belt , his ingenious little it's garry shandling's show and the larry sanders show  
and for god's sake , mike nichols directed the graduate , and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty  
so explain this    
this    
thing  
what planet are you from ? 
purports to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole pop-psychology mars/venus phenomenon  
but what this movie winds up being is a collection of unfunny cringe-inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe-inducing moments ; the end result is , unsurprisingly , an unfunny , uninsightful , cringe-inducing , thoroughly icky embarrassment  
garry shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males ( they reproduce through cloning , of course )  
his leaders put a select group of males through a series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth , find a female of the species , and impregnate her  
they're taught how to pretend that they're listening by nodding and saying "" uh-huh , "" and how to compliment shoes  
imagine my delighted surprise when , oh heavens , all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably , producing comedic results ! 
the lucky winner is fitted with a penis ( since theirs , after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence    
i will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that they're all just clones    
whoops , too late  ) 
the penis , when aroused , tends to make a humming noise  
the writers , when frequently strapped for ideas , tend to turn to this as a source of "" comedy  "" 
it isn't funny the first time  
it isn't funny the eighth time  
it isn't funny the eighteenth time  
if anything , it made me feel vaguely self-conscious  
garry meets up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear , who turns out to be a generic , unlikable scumbag  
he's meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandling's alien character , but he's so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside "

charlotte bennett ) , laurene landon ( velda ) , alan king ( charles kalecki ) , geoffrey lewis ( joe butler ) , paul sorvino ( detective pat chambers ) , judson scott ( charles hendricks ) , barry snider ( romero ) , julia barr ( norma childs ) / mpaa rating : r / review : 
in the 1982 updating of mickey spillane's 1947 novel "" i , the jury , "" hard-boiled detective mike hammer is a vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze trans am , dresses like don johnson in "" miami vice "" with less pastels , and has sworn off alcohol  
however , he still smokes his lucky strikes , detests all forms of authority , and kills at a whim  
beyond that , the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy page-turner by spillane , probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writers  
the movie starts off with a bang : a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series , complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti ( "" rocky "" )  
after that , the movie and the book begin the same , with the murder of jack williams ( frederick downs ) , a one-armed detective and hammer's best friend  
hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack's death , and with the help of his devoted secretary , the blond and shapely velda ( laurene landon ) , and the alternately friendly / antagonistic police chief pat chambers ( paul sorvino ) , he is immediately on the killer's trail  
here the movie splits completely from the book , and dives into a convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia , the cia , one of hammer's vietnam vet buddies , and a kinky sex clinic  
many of the same characters from the book appear in the movie , but they take on slightly different roles  
for instance , charles kalecki ( alan king ) , a numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book , turns into a suave mob boss  
and , more importantly , hammer's suspicious love interest , charlotte bennett ( barbara carrera ) , morphs from a run-of-the-mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic  
 "" i , the jury "" is one of several cinematic renditions of spillane's books ( including a 1953 version which was made in 3-d ) , but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way : it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood's production code  
although this takes the 1982 version of "" i , the jury "" closer to the core of the original subject matter , it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism , because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book  
rest assured , the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity , but it is thoroughly violent , especially toward women  
it features one woman having her neck slashed , a set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia ( judson scott ) , and another woman shot point-blank in the belly by hammer himself  
no one would deny that spillane's writing has a definite misogynistic nature , but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment ; its constant equation of sex and violence , much of which is played with the intention of being erotic , is quite unsettling  
it's no surprise that the movie , like the book , fades to black with a dead woman on the floor  
 "" i , the jury "" had a troubled production and was not well-supported by the studio that made it , which is one explanation why it didn't do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made  
the script was written by larry cohen , who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies , like "" it's alive "" ( 1974 ) and its two sequels , "" q "" ( 1981 ) , and "" the stuff "" ( 1985 )  
cohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well , but he was yanked from the director's chair after only a week's worth of shooting because he was already $100 , 000 over budget  
he was quickly replaced by richard t  heffron , who has worked for the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects  
heffron was obviously brought in not for his talent , but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently  
it shows in the final product  
cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer , but heffron has none  
he shot the movie quickly and clumsily , and although some scenes ring true , most of them are flat , trite , and invariably dull  
the movie features numerous car chases , shoot-outs , and stunts , but heffron's background in television is the dominant tone ; despite the graphic violence and full-frontal nudity , "" i , the jury , "" takes on the air of a made-for-tv quickie , with no real punch or depth  
but the problems in "" i , the jury "" run deeper than the technical  
the central fault in this updating is mike hammer , whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties  
because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person , hammer's character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona  
we never really get that impression in the movie -- there is no first-person voice-over narration and some scenes don't have hammer in them at all  
consequently , a great deal of the texture of spillane's storytelling is lost  
the period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer's moral code is thrown to the wind  
despite his characterization as a hard-nosed , violent , misogynistic killer , hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code  
the title itself , "" i , the jury , "" refers to his anti-establishment notion of being his own law  
unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police , hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment  
in this way , he can be seen as "" above the law , "" but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct , his own morality  
the movie forgoes that aspect of his character , and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society's terms , but in any terms , especially his own  
if anything , hammer always had his professionalism , but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful  
maybe the scene was intended for laughs , but it only cheapens hammer's character and is , by all accounts , a lousy way to start the movie  
the blame for hammer's character can't be laid on assante's shoulders , because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon-like mumbling , he delivers a fine performance  
spillane never once described hammer's physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared , so any actor could conceivably portray him  
of course , because of the lack of written description , those who have read spillane's books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like , and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations ( spillane , who played the character himself in 1963's "" the girl hunters , "" is generally considered the best of the film hammers ) "

-1,"there should be a requirement that a potential viewer be under a certain film iq in order to see "" mission to mars  "" 
there are probably quite a few people who are going to enjoy it , and most of them will probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind  
but there are those who will not , and those will most likely be people who have already seen one or more of the following movies : "" 2001 : a space odyssey , "" "" armageddon , "" "" apollo 13 , "" "" the abyss , "" "" close encounters of the third kind , "" "" e  t  
the extra-terrestrial , "" "" alien , "" and "" aliens  "" 
why ? 
because there is not one original idea in "" mission to mars  "" 
all of it is cribbed from other films ( and in most cases , better films )  
if this is the sort of thing you don't mind , you might like the film  
of course , there are other reasons not to like "" mission to mars , "" the main one being a script written by people who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who haven't used their brains in some time , and who don't intend to start during the film's running time  
 "" mission to mars "" manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time  
the plot , cribbed greatly from "" 2001 , "" concerns a team sent to mars , the first manned trip ever made to the red planet  
luke graham ( don cheadle ) leads the team , jointly formed of americans and russians  
the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse ( this being nothing like the pulse-emitting monolith in "" 2001 "" -- that one was on the * moon * ) , but when they try to study it , a giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them ( all except luke , who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station , which looks strangely like the rotating space station in "" 2001 "" )  
a rescue mission is planned with husband & wife team woody blake ( tim robbins ) and terri fisher ( connie nielsen ) , obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , and extra crew member phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) along for the ride  
after some zero-gravity dancing , they run into problems when one of their engines is blown , forcing them to attempt a desperate landing aboard a supply vessel  
now stranded on mars with minimal supplies , the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home  
after all , that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth  
 "" mission to mars "" is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it , so let's start with one of the things that does work : director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film  
that's it  
everything else fails  
the failure isn't de palma's fault ; he's working from an atrocious script  
only during the sequence aboard the ship ( looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in "" 2001 "" ) where the rescue team's air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does "" mission to mars "" come to life  
a scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension , until you realize that the entire danger/more danger/attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film ; it's just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes  
take it out , and the plot isn't affected in any way  
the sequence also suffers from a few plot holes ( as does the rest of the film ) : why is the ship's computer ( which sounds strangely like hal from , uh , "" 2001 "" ) able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine ? 
why did tim robbins' character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside ? 
shouldn't the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach ? 
why are the characters such idiots ? 
because the script makes little attempt to properly develop them  
all the "" conflict "" is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene ( which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot ) during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know : "" jim , it's too bad you can't go on this mission because you were determined 'psychologically inadequate' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together "" -- does anyone really talk like this ? 
can't we find out these things in a less grating matter , like maybe in a flashback ? 
the whole film is like that  
the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what's going on ; they must * tell * us exactly what we're looking at * every * time  
sample dialogue from the film : ( shot of mars ) astronaut a : "" look , there's mars "" astronaut b : "" you sure that's mars ? "" 
astronaut a : "" yeah , that's mars all right  "" 
astronaut c : "" hey , are you guys looking at mars ? "" 
that exchange isn't actually in "" mission to mars , "" but i wouldn't be surprised if it were  
for all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film haven't learned to do something all those directors did very well : show and don't tell  
de palma used to know how , but seems to have forgotten  
this is mentally-challenged filmmaking ; they assume the audience won't get what's going on , so they explain everything five times over  
fourth-graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted  
the principal actors sleepwalk their way through "" mission to mars , "" never managing to do away with an apparent "" i'm just here to get a paycheck "" attitude  
cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines  
armin mueller-stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo  
robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard "" decent guy "" performance  
and sinise hams it up with "" wistful "" facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy-handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen-from-no-less-than-three-movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them ) conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub-par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then  
and of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in "" 2001 "" who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world  
it could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy "" mission to mars , "" but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow-going  
leisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it , but all of the substance of "" mission to mars "" has been stolen from other films , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters  
supposedly we're intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one ( totally different from the one-character-decides-not-to-return ending of "" armageddon "" ) , but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning  
me , i alternated between the two "

uhhhm , you guessed it    not 
much  
plot : in order to escape major financial difficulties , a local weatherman hooks up with his ball-picking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery  
but as more and more people find out about their scheme , more and more people demand a part of their winnings , and more and more problems arise  
critique : simply stated , i didn't laugh once during this entire picture  
for a comedy , it offered me a few smiles , a bunch of nincompoops as characters , a miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow , in what can only described as a "" sluttier "" version of her character of phoebe on tv's "" friends ""  
this film was not as disastrous as i thought it would be , but it was pretty close  
thankfully , the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits , dancing as the weatherman were left in the film's trailer , and not in this final cut  
and not unlike the worst movie of the year so far , beautiful , this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic , idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast  
foremost was travolta's character , who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie  
and for me , the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong  
he didn't fit the part  
i just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role  
a cool , calculating roughneck with a certain hip , suave "" je ne sais quoi ""  
in this film , he looks like he's trying to be funny , trying to be bad , trying to be good  
we're not supposed to be able to notice that , and when we do , at least in my case , i consider it a wrong choice in casting  
add that to lisa kudrow , boring us with yet another one of her patented "" dumb blonde "" routines , but this time , dressed in sexier outfits  
michael rapaport , stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isn't quite up at the same speed level as everyone else  
and a truckload of empty comedic bullet shells , and you've got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize  
the only real good thing that i could say about this film is that its story was actually half-interesting and never really bored me  
i also liked michael moore's perverted cousin character , and i loved , and i say it again , loved the character that bill pullman played  
give this dude his own movie ! 
he played a lazy cop , a man who tries everything not to do any real work  
he fakes injuries to get off duty , tries to avoid arrest situations so that he won't have to fill out any forms    now 
there's a base of humor  
sadly , the filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left in the film  
and there's not much else i can say about this movie , folks  
on the whole , it was lame , included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in a pool of unfunny lines , and very little of interest for any target audience "
-1,"it's been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci-fi opus `mission to mars' , and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar  
why ? 
the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy , stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera , instead shooting for the angle of a feel-good science fiction drama more akin to `2001 : a space odyssey'  
i got the feeling that most of my fellow movie-going patrons were expecting another `armageddon'  
but no , `mission to mars' certainly isn't one large action sequence about colossal disaster  
this is a supposedly thoughtful , family-friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel  
you have been warned  
of course , crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible ( see `apollo 13' for an excellent example ) , but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation  
brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off  
when he gets his hands on an intelligent , systematically practical script like `the untouchables' or `mission : impossible' , the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement ( although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally )  
of course , there's also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name ( including `snake eyes' and the notorious bomb `the bonfire of the vanities' )     
all of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood  
that term may be too harsh , but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is `mission to mars' , my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient  
if i were gary sinise , i wouldn't touch de palma with a 10-foot pole  
sinise is a wonderful , wonderful actor , but after appearing in `snake eyes' and this vomit-inducing sham , i'm sure he wouldn't want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration  
the academy award-winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell , a man who recently lost his wife ( kim delaney ) and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars ( oops , forgot to mention the year - 2020 )  
after a barbecue get-together for the astronauts , we cut to luc goddard ( don cheadle ) and his team , who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet  
suddenly , a towering formation of rocks and soil - probably best dubbed a `sand tornado' - appears and creates a whirlwind of suction  
for some reason , the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this , as if it were a lovely piece of art  
the team is killed within seconds , expect for luc , who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive  
immediately , a second mission - consisting of astronauts mcconnell , husband and wife woody and terri blake ( tim robbins and connie nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) - are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars  
let's put the `secret' on hold for now , and discuss the trip there  
it is explained , whether scientifically accurate or not ( probably not ) , that a trip to mars takes roughly six months  
i'm not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind `m2m' didn't capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia  
instead , we join the team during their final days aboard the ship  
what happened during the five months prior to this ? 
did they just play cards and tell dirty jokes ? 
still , there are few nicely tense moments ( maybe the only in the movie ) during the time-frame involving a fuel leak  
depalma's direction is quite good in these scenes , although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent ( organ music in space ? 
c'mon )  
there's a few good , imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese , a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud  
it's a colossal bummer that `mission to mars' is poorly assembled and laughably written , with a dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists  
as mentioned before , anyone looking for some disaster-movie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed    
maybe even cheated  
after the unbelievably hokey final shot ( with the words ? the end' somehow adding insult to injury ) , a few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen  
others muttered obscenities , shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling `jeez , that sucked  ' 
okay , it did suck  
but you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy    
after all , they do pretty well  
sinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes , robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple , and funnyman o'connell - well , he has a couple lines are actually amusing ( and intentionally so ) "

-1,"welcome to your oh-so typical sequel  
it tries to be twice as big as it's predecessor , yet ends up twice as shallow  
shallow     hmm    now there's an idea  
maybe if the ill-fated cruise liner in this movie had struck a shallow reef early on things may have turned out better  
the first thing that struck me    and 
surprised me , was that the camera work ( for the opening sequence anyway ) was terrible  
looked like the cameramen were drunk and kept tripping on their own feet       very 
different to the original movie  
the characters ? 
well , not many of the characters actually * had * characters , but here's a rundown  
annie , who was the highlight of the the original , must have seriously banged her head in the train crash at the end of the first movie  
why ? 
because something's got to account for her losing that many iq points  
even though annie wasn't exactly a rocket scientist in speed , here some of her actions just make you want to beat your head against a wall  
for instance , after successfully using a chainsaw to cut a hole in a door so that a group of people can escape noxious gases - she stands in the middle of the opening for about five minutes till someone reminds her that the people can't get ut till she get's the chainsaw out of their faces     bang 
bang bang 
in point of fact sandra's character is turned into little more than one of those scantly dressed extras from hercules , who constantly has to be rescued  
jason patric ? 
all i can say is bring back keanu  
keanu reeves might have the emotional range of a tree stump    but 
that's one more tree stump than jason has  
i don't think he changed facial expressions all movie - jason , smile for the cameras ! ! 
now frown !    i said frown    "

-1,"it seemed like the perfect concept  
what better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? 
it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh  
jim carrey's signed on too ? 
even better  
the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as "" schizophrenia , "" and so forth  
such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire , proving that some people just couldn't take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy  
yes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny  
it's not for lack of trying  
the farrellys utilize in "" me , myself & irene "" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them  
this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult  
soon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster  
this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted , or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street  
then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks  
some have suggested that this isn't a problem , because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work  
they're wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort , 1996's "" there's something about mary  "" 
 ( 1999's "" outside providence "" was technically an earlier project  ) 
the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected  
in "" mary , "" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion  
 "" me , myself & irene , "" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at "" mary "" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work  
having been produced by the same guys who made "" mary , "" "" irene "" seems like an even bigger disappointment  
the brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes  
but they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of "" me , myself & irene "" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy  
the plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p  waters ( renee zellweger ) , who's in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that's entirely predictable from the get-go  
 ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? 
yeah , me too  ) 
the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be  
compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it's no longer funny , merely gross  
the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry  
take , for example , the subplot involving charlie's three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon )  
the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face  
but by the end of the film , they're still doing the same schitck it hasn't been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn't been dropped either  
that's too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through  
 "" me , myself & irene "" reeks of wasted opportunities  
there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie's new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank's actions  
this doesn't really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie's condition early on , so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it  
the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , "" whitey "" ) , but the script doesn't go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax  
jim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he's left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in "" all of me  "" 
it's a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny  
carrey doesn't pull any stunts we don't expect him to pull , and the farrellys' script doesn't give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren't set up in any meaningful way  
perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better  
zellweger's irene is not a strong female lead mary in "" mary "" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed  
irene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she's ditzy , clever , or neither  
as such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only "" sane "" person in the film  
chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this "
-1,
-1,"for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer , hard boiled , face off ) appears to have made an exciting , elegant , charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them  
sadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two-hour long episode of magyuver  
and not a particularly good one at that  
what went wrong ? 
mi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it'll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise's firing gun just so they can die really cool  
early on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic  
in one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other's eyes with come hither sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff  
prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another  
why ? 
i haven't the foggiest  
i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply  
with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects  
it's possible that these "" spies "" could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored  
the scenes i've described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character  
god forbid  
woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial-like visuals  
still in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish  
cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is )  
between the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact  
the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us  
sure it's all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product  
thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that's about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight  
they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres  
newton bats her eyes flirtatiously  
cruise grins a little too slyly  
the cruise character , ethan hunt , has been drastically altered since the first film  
here cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1  
he's cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90's )  
sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise's initial "" i'm the man ! "" 
charm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug  
mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won't stop  
the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could've been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the "" symbolic "" pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture )  
we've all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand  
it isn't done any differently here  
the action is pure hard target \ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind  
he's cool for sure but he's made to be as empty as the movie  
the actor isn't used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one  
when he's not beaming away , he's staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell , but woo's editing seriously undermines the effort  
he fetishizes cruise's angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof  
i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he's really austin powers  
in a classic woo action moment , ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death  
the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise , basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does )  
the lead bad guy ( played by the appropriately british dougray scott ) and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken ? ? ? on motorcycles  
though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment , the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug , only to fly about a hundred feet ( still in bear hug position ) , land on a beach below and begin a mano-e-mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a "" so you thought i was dead   "

however , unlike his previous work , the film dwells on a more personal story , and with a female protagonist  
and in no looking back , he stumbles , making a slow , boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work  
claudia ( lauren holly ) is a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life  
she's at a turning point in her life , and feels as if she's going nowhere  
her boyfriend , michael ( jon bon jovi ) , is broke and in a dead end job  
if she were to marry him , she'd never get a chance to escape this town  
enter charlie ( edward burns ) , claudia's old flame  
he skipped town several years before , without any explanations    even 
for claudia  
he has come back to town to see her , and suddenly she is torn  
should she stay with stable michael , and never escape her hometown    or 
should she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again  
part of the answer lies in the character of her mother ( blythe danner ) , who fell for the wrong man    and has spent her life pining for claudia's father to return  
now it seems that claudia is about to make the same mistakes  
at only a little past ninety minutes , no looking back is rather short for its genre  
unfortunately , it seems much much longer  
the storyline is simple and uninspired , and there's a lack of energy to the whole proceedings , which makes the entire drama rather tedious  
edward burns makes a misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame  
there's no one to restrain his ego , which reigns unchecked  
he walks into the room and lauren holly swoons    yeah , 
right  
lauren holly does what she can with her central character  
but we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions    and 
we never really care  
bon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie  
his acting talents are much greater than they might seem , but he is given a mostly bland and ineffective role to work with  
there's not much to recommend in no looking back  
it's not that the film is bad    it's 
simply boring "

-1,"romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant  
with director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top-notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination  
those mentioned films , however , brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not : a solid , well-written screenplay  
call me cynical , but the jobs of writer and producer don't seem to mix well  
gary oldman plays jack grimaldi , a good cop turned bad , selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife  
his cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname , although the name doesn't provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character  
jack has become addicted to "" feeding the hole "" , a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money  
when he realizes his colleagues are being shot , he feebly attempts to get out  
gary oldman's performance is disappointingly weak ; he seems nearly bored  
in the process , he also gets tangled-up with mona demarkov , a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone , played adequately by roy scheider  
demarkov , played by lena olin , is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world  
this character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2  i can't remember seeing a character quite like her  
after being shot , handcuffed , and thrown in the back seat of a car , she still manages to cause an accident , kick out the windshield with her legs , grab a suitcase full of money ( plus some important documentation ) , climb through the rubble , land on her shot leg , and still succeed at running for safety  
what a woman ! 
lena olin's performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film  
anabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeo's wife  
there is little insight into her character  
she's depressed , she makes obvious references , she mopes around the house  
juliette lewis , as romeo's girlfriend , is treated with the same cliche attitudes , although ms  lewis' portrayal certainly didn't improve it  
both women were anything but sexy or attractive  
poorly developed characters aside , the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems  
it is so discouraging to watch a film and want to shout at the main character ( not ) to do something  
for example , jack and his friends attend a funeral to hang in the background to scope-out the mob scene  
fine  
jack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite  
fine  
what does jack proceed to do ? 
he brushes his friends off by telling them he isn't feeling well , then strolls over to the boss  
why ? 
the boss had all ready threatened him ; falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jack's toes by the gravesite  
i guess they weren't worried about any federal agents lingering around after the funeral     
or here's another : demarkov set-up her own death by cutting off her arm with a circular saw  
she proceeded to set the place on fire  
wouldn't the flames burn off the fingerprints ? 
aren't dental records more important ? 
as bright and resourceful as she was supposed to be , couldn't she come up with a better plot ? 
 ( and it took her no time at all to get a good-fitting , functional prosthesis  ) 
lack of attention to detail certainly adds up in a film  
this film doesn't even add up the large details  
there is little or no consistency in the story-line  
not much makes sense  
the direction lacks cohesion , surprising from a director whose previous credits are impeccable  
the moods shift , the styles shift , and no one can seem to decide if it is a serious film or satire of one  
so while it certainly isn't reservoir dogs , it certainly isn't diva "

-1,"while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks  
and , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year  
the trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it's a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you've seen the animated series on hbo you'll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he's been sent to hell  
todd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else  
not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while  
every character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student  
the story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life  
al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d  b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him  
the next element in the film is the part when things go awry  
and as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al  
as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene  
inevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away  
hence , jason's mischievous master-mind plan , to ` conquer the world "" is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil's army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again  
so , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife  
time passes  
and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc    
this character is merely a poor man's obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla  
now the stage is set spawn , the new `enemy of evil' vs evil  
and evil takes the cake , doubtlessly  
john leguizamo's deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film's relief point  
all this anguish , pain , half-baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so-so one liners  
and then there's martin sheen  
whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years  
his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent  
as the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b-movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot  
this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street  
i'd never thought i'd be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen's career is in better shape  
spawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable  
for most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better  
it constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie  
continually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures are being made  
perhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry  
the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible  
the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting  
it is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton's batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act  
but bruce wayne had human elements to him  
he was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human  
the character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he's fatigued about being normal  
and as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary  
none of this is present in spawn "

write a line for the one of prisoners like "" i just want to go home and eat christmas dinner and watch some ball with my dad  "" 
then , have ben affleck actually say that line , on film , and forget to leave it on the cutting room floor  
for good measure , throw in a poorly motivated prison riot and have affleck's best buddy stabbed

already the cliches are piled on thick , and when it rains , it pours  
how to take my attention , dash it violently against the rocks , and make it so that i'm contemplating my strategy for calling "" shotgun "" about an hour before i know the credits will roll : deny your characters the ability to think  
have ben affleck , for some reason i'll never understand , pretend he's his dead prison buddy so that he can get his girlfriend , played by charlize theron  
have gary sinise show up and force the two of them to participate in a poorly planned casino heist  
the villains' big idea ? 
kidnap affleck because he used to be a security guard at the casino , force him to tell you where all the doors in the place are , then dress up in santa suits , create some "" diversions "" and rob the place  
on paper , it seems like the stuff of a potential caper comedy , but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks he's looking at the makings for some sort of clever action-crime thriller  
it's not like the man isn't capable    
far from it

it occurred to me while i was watching "" house on haunted hill  "" 
it is as follows : if a trailer makes the film it's advertising look like a trashy , stupid movie , well guess what ? 
chances are , there * is * truth in advertising  
too bad i didn't trust my own instincts when something-or-the-other possessed me to see this movie  
i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of "" sleepy hollow  "" 
that and "" dogma "" started too late in the afternoon for my schedule  
an hour of "" angel "" or "" buffy "" is scarier than this doozy that tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face  
i wish i'd seen it when it was halloween  
at least i would have been forgiving  
hey , tis the season  
the movie was scary ( albeit very confusing , dizzying , and nauseating ) at first , but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously wasn't going anywhere  
now i truly appreciate films like "" scream , "" "" halloween , "" or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic  
that's what spooks people out , the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know  
there has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with  
sure , utterly unpredictable is good , too , but that's different from utterly nonsensical  
hohh ( house on haunted hill ) , on the other hand  
  
  
well let's just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they oh-so-cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago  
riiiiight  
y'know , that just sends chills down my spine  
yeah  
just like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil  
ooooooo  
hint : blood and guts only work a few times  
sooner or later people start to tell themselves that it's just ketchup and props and you've got to come up with something better than that  
there were just too many things in this movie that we've all seen before ; from the inevitable "" plot developments "" of strangers unwittingly trapped together ; strangers turning against each other ; the evil manifesting itself ; the dead coming back for a last scare  
each was more predictable than the last  
why didn't these fools just stay together in one place anyways ? 
sheesh  
was i grossed out ? 
yes  
did i get spooked a few times ? 
yes  
but why ? 
i get really disturbed when there is no why  
when there weren't random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect ( which wasn't that good either , trust me ) and the scare , the film was filled with drab , laughable dialogue  
the characters were incredibly flat and cliched  
not to mention downright annoying  
you've got a bunch of people going nowhere in their lives ; of course they're dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night  
jeez , i thought no one fell for those "" you may already be a winner "" things anymore  
and of course , all three gals are babes  
i wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of "" shine "" ended up in this movie  
keep that up , geoff , and you'll qualify for the next batman venture  
the only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan because , well , he just cracks me up  
and famke jansen ( sp ? ) 
because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan  
pierce brosnan ( hey , i willingly endured "" dante's peak "" three times for him : ) "

the following review contains some harsh language * * * 
the blair witch project  
quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time  
if you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace , because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy  
my colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more , then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more  
and this worked for him  
well , i'm sorry , but nothing    
is nothing ! ! ! ! ! 
nothing is not more  
it's nothiiiiiinggggggggggg ! ! ! ! ! !  
i do not pay 5 dollars to see nothing  
 "" nothing "" is free , available all around the world at a location near you  
i am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary  
i could just discount them and say , "" well , i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow  "" 
but i have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesn't hold water  
there must be some other reason  
 ( then again , maybe my first thought is correct , i think i'll try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction  ) 
when i hear people praising this film , i never hear them talking about what makes up about 97% of this movie : three kids bickering with each other about being lost  
they only talk about what might make up possibly 3 to 4 minutes of screen time  
this being a few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout "" josh ! ! "" 
over and over  
this film should not be called the blair witch project , it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost    
and argue with each other  
oh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting "" josh ! ! ""  
and if you thought that was scary , wait till you see a pile of rocks , and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs , oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear  
oh yeah , and some goo on one of their backpacks  
you've never seen terror like this folks , and you don't want to  
the chevy chase/goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film  
 ( for current films , i highly recommend the sixth sense or a stir of echoes for a creepy filmgoing experience  ) 
this film is an example of marketing with no substance  
the marketing was brilliant , and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film  
they want this film to be good  
and i think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they don't have anything else to praise  
that wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along , but this is not it  
this film could have been so much better  
just think , if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost , and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff  
i saw this movie with a girl who was extremely pumped for it  
she was sold on this film

-1,"roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , "" who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by    
ben kingsley ? "" 
my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it  
they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles  
the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious  
that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast  
gary "" gal "" dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain  
life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing  
but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch  
the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa  
the second punch comes from gal's past  
back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal  
he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal  
don will accept any decision gal makes from "" yes "" to "" certainly  "" 
however , if gal says "" no "" don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy's ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman )  
in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody's skin  
kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness  
there are some serious problems in louis mellis's and david scinto's script that should have been caught before filming  
when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success  
beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him  
any local hood could have done what gal is needed for  
additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault  
no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool  
in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar  
i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade  
the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability  
the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im  
it is not a great plot  
in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards  
perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film  
it is an old plot dressed up to look new  
if the plot is old , at least the style is creative  
this is director jonathan glazer's first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout  
his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences  
cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes  
we see one side of a person's faces  
but the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit  
half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden  
us yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog  
at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language  
sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film  
the plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western "

-1,"ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film ; i have a problem even regarding it as a film  
it's more of a show , a big commercial for ted turner's world championship wrestling ( wcw )  
the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page , goldberg , and sting  
the story is very minimal and basic  
there are these two guys , gordy ( david arquette ) and sean ( scott caan )  
they are two twenty-something wrestling fans from wyoming  
when they go to a live event for the big match up , there favorite wrestler jimmy king ( oliver platt ) is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus ( joe pantoliano )  
gordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus' plans  
on the way , they meet some people , have some fun , and clean up some port-o-potties  
sounds great huh , well it's not  
the movie makes many attempts at humor , only a few of them work  
the jokes that make you laugh , however , do not outnumber the film's many duds  
there is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa  
the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back  
i especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquette's tag team partner is 'macho man' randy savage  
they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor  
the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan  
mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl , the cheerleaders of the wcw  
she becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice , funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan's breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face  
now what didn't work in this movie ? 
that would be the rest of it  
the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets  
the two lead characters work for a port-o-potty cleaning company and when they crash the truck , the excrements spill all over the road  
it's not funny ; it's pathetic and brainless  
the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way  
i watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie  
the main characters in the film actually get to wrestle , like that would happen to any fan , especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set  
also , i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily ; they just walked right in  
i like wrestling  
i watch it at home and laugh  
it's continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldn't watch it  
this movie wasn't even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv  
the only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew  
the funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently  
the movie was too dim-witted to be funny  
it is possibly the most useless and under-developed film ever  
a recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film , detroit rock city  
that movie was interesting , well done and continuously funny unlike this film  
the acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh  
now that the scream trilogy is over , arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb 1-800-call-att ads  
at least he has a hot wife in courtney cox  
he's in the funny parts of the film but there aren't enough to make him look good  
the music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock's "" bawitdaba "" and "" cowboy ""  
martin landau has a great cameo as a classic , hard-nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne "

-1,"14 years ago , national lampoon introduced us to a new family - the griswolds  
in 1983 , the griswolds embarked on a cross-country journey with the destination of wally world , a world-renowned theme park in california  
we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured  
two years later , we watched again as they went to europe , and four years after that , we shared christmas with them  
now , eight more years have passed , and the laughs have done more than die  
they've been cremated  
vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold , the good intentioned but ill-fated father of two  
the premise is basically the same  
clark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation , this time to las vegas  
his wife ellen ( beverly d'angelo ) and teenage kids rusty and audrey ( always played by different actors - this time around , by ethan embry and marisol nichols , respectively ) join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick  
of course a "" vacation "" movie wouldn't be complete without good ole eddie ( reprised by randy quaid ) , the misfit cousin , showing up at all the wrong times  
there isn't too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it  
it's really just a skit movie  
there are a couple of ways to define a skit movie , which is not a real term as far as i know  
the first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours , therefore coming off like a two hour skit  
the second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits , each lasting about five minutes  
vegas vacation comes off like the first  
a good example of the latter would be last year's black sheep  
the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast , and it doesn't really fit into a movie mold  
in these cases , a "" plot "" , which is generally very thin , is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags ( i  e  
have a good vegas joke , make a vegas movie )  
such is the case with this movie's mini-plots  
clark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold's money , ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton ( ! ) , rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage , and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie ( shae d'lyn ) as an exotic dancer  
the simple fact is : this movie isn't funny  
at first , i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes , but when the movie got rolling , my interest suddenly stopped  
chase plays clark griswold really well  
he made the character and he is the character  
d'angelo , to be quite honest , never was too impressive as ellen , and this movie doesn't show any signs of redemption  
as for the two new griswold kids , the word "" blah "" comes to mind  
the "" vacation "" series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters , the simple reason being that there is nothing to them  
they're so generic , you'll expect the credits to read "" girl #1 as audrey griswold ""  
vegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor  
yes , it's true that vegas vacation isn't even close to being close to being as funny as the others , which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways , but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart  
first off , why did they leave off the national lampoon's heading on the title ? 
i couldn't find any reasons why , but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn't want to be associated with such a lame film  
that's saying a lot , especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented : loaded weapon 1 , pcu , etc  if they expected this to be another hit , you would assume they'd be proud to tack on the notorious header , but for reasons only we can guess at , like the movie sucking , they didn't  
there is another difference here that makes an obvious impact  
the first three films in the "" vacation "" series were written by john hughes , a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80's including mr  
mom , sixteen candles , the breakfast club , weird science , pretty in pink , ferris bueller's day off , planes , trains , and automobiles , and uncle buck  
wowzers ! 
what a r ? sum ? ! 
looking at the names , you'd think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980's  
well that's not all  
this guy also brought us 90's hits including the home alone series , the remake of 101 dalmatians , dennis the menace , and the current flubber "

-1,"well there goes another one  
sadly this like other movies this year wasn't good  
this one being almost as bad as 'the omega code' but not quite  
from the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad , and well i guess i was right  
with bad excuses for acting , a horrible screenplay and straight-out bad direction 'the bachelor' is a terribly unfunny movie that doesn't work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance  
the two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best  
the movie is troubled from the start because chris o'donnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date  
here is the stupid plot : chris o'donnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend , he meets anne ( rene zellwegar ) they instantly hit it off and are together for three years  
jimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up  
he really doesn't realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her ( what he wants i never did catch )  
so he proposes in a really bad way , and she shoots him down and is very mad  
he of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any  
then his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars     as 
long as he marries before the next day at 6 : 05 pm  
now jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her , or get married to someone else to get the money itself , leading to an un-funny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths  
ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest , cliched , silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs  
even the supporting roles of artie lange , hal holbrook and ed anser aren't even good  
the plot was a good idea , but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old  
the choppy dialogue and bad directing don't help things any  
even though chris o'donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies , he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him  
rene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming , sweet and likable performance ( as usual ) and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout  
her sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen  
brooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a big-headed mogul who after a while became routine and old  
one really can't help but think that we have seen this stuff before  
it's not like this is an original idea and in the end , everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness  
'the bachelor' works on no good levels and in fact doesn't work at all  
ed anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul , and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career  
chris o'donnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal  
he seems held back and really doesn't get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old  
artie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and un-nerving  
why the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie , with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know  
maybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success , and sometimes i don't agree with other critics on movies , even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts  
its based on the 1925 silent film 'seven chances' which i am sure is very better than this mess  
even though some may think of this as a good date movie , most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back  
besides being a terrible movie , 'the bachelor' is well a terrible movie  
it has nothing worth recommending therefore i really can't recommend this movie  
i did not have a good time and i laughed only three times  
the running time of the movie is 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes  
parts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time  
being one of the worst movies of the year , we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies , and if they do they i give up on filmmakers "

-1,"the tagline for this film is : "" some houses are just born bad ""  
so i didn't expect too much from this  
but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre  
i thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont  
i thought , mabe it will be fun ? 
and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing  
but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ?  
these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality  
here is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation  
among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor )  
actually , the doctor is researching the "" primordial fear reaction "" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens  
but he gets unexpected help from the house itself  
it rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights  
portals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs  
a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth  
filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains  
but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen  
the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture  
is that exciting or what ? 
the worst thing about it is that it didn't have to be bad  
it's based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , '' by shirley jackson  
a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent  
it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience  
 "" the blair witch project "" , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses  
and with a $70 mill  
budget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror  
de bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening  
he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush  
but why give him a more serious material ? 
in the end "" haunting "" will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont's career as a director  
yet it wouldn't be fair to say that everything is bad  
the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky  
but this is where the good things end  
the music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is absolutely without life  
it's nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza ; visually impressive , but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn't engage  
at first you do not know what's going on  
is this part of the experiment ? 
are these hallucinations ? 
projections of the subconscience ? 
paranoia ? 
but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening  
the house is actually possessed  
it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window  
for ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that's what i got ? 
i believe hichock once said that "" it's better to wait for a climax , than to see one ""  
this may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only stupid  
they are impossible to take seriously  
any paralells that you might have heard before , linking this picture to kubrick's "" the shining "" , are absolutely baseless  
 "" shining "" had class , style , story , acting , but most of all talent and originality  
 "" haunting "" has only special effects and art direction to boast of  
and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film "

i really do  
every time i watch great movies like goodfellas ( 1990 ) or raiders of the lost ark ( 1981 ) , a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent , skill and entertainment that is on display  
even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1/3 ( 1994 ) or ghostbusters ii ( 1988 ) while not exactly brilliantly well made , are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value  
then there's my favourite martian , the exact opposite of what a movie should be : a hurried , poorly written and acted movie with one goal , to make money  
disney , ever since the lion king ( 1994 ) have lost their magic touch , but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk  
christopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t  v reporter's tim o'hara car ( daniels ) , and soon tim finds the martian in his home , trying to recover and fix his spaceship  
along with his 'zoot' spacesuit , voiced by wayne knight , must fix his spaceship before it explodes , and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public , firstly by o'hara , but later by rival t  v presenter brace channing ( hurley ) , by calling himself tim's 'uncle martin  ' 
'laughter' is supposed to arise from the 'comical' events , but never does  
many bad films have good intentions , but my favourite martian doesn't appear to try to provide any entertainment  
filled to the brim with wham bang special effects , my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy  
christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie , i've never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now  
jeff daniels plays 'staple nice guy' and his role is useless  
his performance is incredibly lazy , although his paperthin character doesn't deserve more than the performance he gives  
darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever , but her role is somewhat , erm , limited  
hurley mistakes 'acting' for 'shouting and looking like a twit' and wins the david wilcock award for 'most irritating , godawful performance in a moving picture  ' 
way to go liz ! 
for the supporting cast , disney manage to assemble every character actor out there , during the film i was going 'he was the guy in    ah   er    ' 
before finally giving up and switching off  
another major setback is the staple 'comedy sidekick  ' 
unfortunately , the writers ( sherri stoner and deanna oliver , if anyone cares ) forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be 'funny  ' 
instead , they deliver zoot , the martians deeply unfunny sidekick  
although meant to be a manic character no doubt , every line that comes out of his 'neck' is a dud  
a real dud  
citizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester  
even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character : not one child even bothered to smirk  
it's a nice special effect , though  
another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves  
or rather , the lack of them  
my favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour : it goes past the bowl , down the pipe and into the sewer  
now , toilet humour can be funny , as dumb and dumber ( 1994 ) humorously showed  
but here , characters farting , belching and almost getting crapped on ( literally ) is not 'amusing  ' 
it's insulting  
there's one good gag right before the credits , but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued  
either that , or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldn't mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes "

-1,"synopsis : cro-magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion  
reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy-style , ayla grows up to become a blond , feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate  
comments : allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies  
she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner  
the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title  
not even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese  
it's so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it's oddly fascinating  
the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out  
the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m  auel  
to this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following  
i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother  
i have never read this book , but i sure hope it's 10 , 000 times better than its film adaptation  
if not , then i'm at a complete loss to explain its popularity  
the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene  
a young ayla , looking much like drew barrymore in e  t  , 
tramps about in the woods  
with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her , the audience's expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered  
what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla's mother ( a blonde with fur pants    er , 
leggings )  
tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera    well , 
as the earthquake slowly recedes  
a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch , but the screaming six-year-old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven  
i won't detail the story any further ; this seems enough to illustrate my point  
this movie is really stupid  
it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief  
also , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston  
the movie doesn't just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four  
a blond , gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs  
she's of the "" new people "" ; they're of the "" old people "" with "" the memories  "" 
yep  
we get it  
we get it  
the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up , which surprises me  
the movie depends upon a lot of make-up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing  
as stated before , daryl hannah is daryl hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time  
the rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt  
the face-painting that's occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind "
-1,"various films seen at the seattle film festival : 
it's all true/three men on a raft ( u  s  a  , 1942/1986 ) director : orson welles 
a recently uncovered one-fourth of orson welle's planned "" docu-drama "" of amazing stories around the world named it's all true , this short dealt with welle's attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft  
while several clips of the film are seen , the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle's attempts to film it , despite studio problems , a staggering workload , and extremely ill fortune on the set  
impressive photography , but really only interesting to film historians  
sadie thompson ( u  s  a  , 1928 ) director : raoul walsh screenwriter : raoul walsh , from the john colton play "" rain "" , based on w  somerset maugham's story "" miss thompson "" cast : gloria swanson , raoul walsh , lionel barrymore silent 
after the discussion of the newly-restored version of frank capra's lost horizon , where several scenes had been restored using stills , i was interested to see sadie thompson , where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago  
this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story "" miss thompson ""  
this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen--little awkwardness , and a very clever script  
the actors : gloria swanson , raoul walsh ( who also directed and wrote the screenplay ) and especially lionel barrymore , as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie's soul , but really wants to get her between the sheets , is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel  
swanson adds real life to the character , adding an worldly , affectionate air to the bawdy sadie  
unfortunately , the ending is rather poorly tied up ; it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live-action film , or the original script  
the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on ( i cannot believe maugham's short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia ) ; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we've been waiting an hour and a half for  
still , it's entertaining right up to the end ; certainly barrymore's incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the silent screen ) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells , bakkers , and robertses of the religious worlds  
a c movie ; worth 2  50 if you can find it  
the pied piper ( czechoslovakia , 1986 ) director : jim barta screenwriter : kamil piza 
this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids  
it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate , and with a lot of political comment along with it  
perhaps economic content is a better word--it certainly doesn't show capitalism in a good light  
nor human nature , nor anything else , for that matter  
as you may have guessed , this is not a tgif film ; this is the kind of film you are glad is over  
not that it wasn't interesting for technical reasons ; this is stop-animation that is very well done  
all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts--except for the animated stuffed rats  
boy , sounds like a real comedy vehicle , doesn't it ? 
add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison , and you have something to give the wee ones ( and some of the mentally unstable larger folk ) to keep them up at night  
some gore  
don't bring children to this one  
don't bring adults to this one , unless they're fascinated by puppetry and/or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped  
blech  
  no fun whatsoever  
meier ( west germany , 1986 ) director/screenwriter : peter timm cast : rainier grenkowitz , nadja engelbrecht , alexander hauff , thomas besvater sub-titled 
this film takes us back and forth over the east german/west german border with meier , an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money  
his uncle ( also in the west ) sneaks meier out of the country , unknown to the east germans  
meier , however , is less than thrilled-- his girlfriend , his friends and his job ( which he likes ) all exist in east germany  
after a round-the-world trip ( his boss think's he's on leave in bulgaria ) , meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id , and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew's work--while everyone think's he's still living in east germany  
of course , something goes wrong--and the ending is very funny , but it takes the film too long to get there  
the humor is spread too thin , and much of the plot is too obvious ( as is the acting )  
still , a good concept for the comedy , and the last five minutes are pretty funny

-1,"paul verhoeven , the dutch auteur who dragged his violent , sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film , has never been what i'd consider a thoughtful director ( though some of his films , notably starship troopers , have been lauded as artistic achievements ) , but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who's managed to , no matter what the budget , make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils  
starship troopers was essentially a b-monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange ( a great film that's nearly impossible to find on video , yet showgirls is everywhere ) , in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ; the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards ( who may actually be 45% silicone ) , in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage  
it's not a completely successful film , but as a failure it's certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining ) one  
my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores ; spetters , a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange ( haven't yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight )  
i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop , a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic hero that's as touching as schwarzenegger's in t2  
that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics  
its violence seemed to be there for a purpose , namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread , not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience  
there's a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him  
he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim's every fearful tic  
it's a startling moment of barbaric , maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk-noir  
in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won't shut up , he impales a co-worker , drowns another and so on  
but why ? 
his character is introduced as a smug genius , the kind who's always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear , sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place , though once the character becomes invisible , this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster  
the kind who just won't die  
hollow man's protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda ( elizabeth shue , acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm ) and her lover , a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who's saddled with the film's worst lines ( "" i've lost cohesion again ! "" )  
they're a typical aaron spelling couple , good-looking but as vacant as george w  bush's republican national convention speech ( i  e  
bush referring to clinton ; "" ? ? ? so much promise ? ? ? but to what end ? 
to what end ? "" -- 
this actually got applause ! 
suddenly warren beatty doesn't look so absurd )  
the rest of the film's characters are all well past thirty , though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained one-liners ; is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood's new character developing technique ? 
ahh , what a cynical time we live in ? ? ? 
as the picture opens we meet cain ( kevin bacon ) , an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret ( so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation's ) project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility ( for what purpose is never hinted at )  
they've performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine , in a twist worthy of the film's 1950's late show origins , to impulsively experiment on himself  
caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co-workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead  
our mad scientist is turned invisible ( after several fx-heavy complications ) , then he inexplicably ( it's hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures , but this is never explored , and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human ? ) 
begins raping , assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases , always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger  
it grows abundantly clear with each new release that it's verhoeven's films that have become hollow  
like the rest , this one is cold , heartless , and full of contempt for humanity , but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit , insight and makes no statement other than "" audiences will pay for anything these days ""  
it's an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level , or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun , thrill-a-minute ride  
verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care  
the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick  
how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self ? 
a couple weeks ago , after seeing the trailer , a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability  
hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa , in a serious manner to boot  
but oh yeah , it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway  
verhoeven delivers the sleazy "" goods "" , but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner , here it just feels icky and uncomfortable  
the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses , caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux-psycho music strains in the background  
it's plainly obvious that verhoeven isn't exploring voyeurism ( like in the classic peeping tom ) but exploiting it and not even doing that very well  
it's funny that with all the technology $90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a woman's naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand  
most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks  
in fact it's largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since , by the end , most of his potential victims don infer-red glasses that track his body heat  
as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov ( a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre ) , and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked  
the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy  
it happens when a lab assistant ( kim dickens , who looks like she stepped out of playboy ) in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon , suddenly pauses  
 "" are you looking at me ? "" , she queries , obviously haunted  
it's a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982 ( the apex of the mad slasher craze )  
those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer  
and they're the only reason to check out hollow man , preferably as a mid-week bargain rental "

book of shadows : blair witch 2 
a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman 
certain things in our lives are inevitable  
death , sorrow , love , heartbreak , pain , joy  
we expect these events  
we know they're going to happen and some , we even look forward to  
it's part of the human condition  
we have also become accustomed to inevitable occurrences in our society  
as we near the fall election , several of them are hitting us in the face  
politicians exaggerate their own importance  
our side is always right ; theirs is always wrong  
in the end , voters are usually forced to choose the lesser of two whocares  
in hollywood the one indisputable inevitable is that if a film makes big money , there will be a sequel  
even if the original story doesn't merit one  
even if the first film is complete in itself  
even if success is a fluke  
 "" the blair witch project "" was made with a budget of $1  75 and exploded on the screen , raking in huge profits  
the concept was brilliant  
the filmmakers created a remarkable buzz that the story might be real  
the film itself was even more convincing  
the movie _must_ be authentic  
why else would such amateurish footage be on the big screen ? 
the first film caught lightning in a bottle  
the sequel proves you can't pour that old lightning into a new bottle  
you have to give this effort some credit  
it would have been easy to have made the same movie again with a new group of kids  
it would have been easy , but of course , it wouldn't have worked  
instead "" book of shadows "" acknowledges the first film as a movie and concentrates on the hysteria following its release  
it's a great scheme and possibly the only entertaining way to do a sequel  
unfortunately it doesn't work either  
five kids spend the night in the woods at the scene of the first film  
weird stuff happens and they retreat to an old factory where one of them lives  
even weirder stuff happens  
some people die , there's blood and knives and none of the characters have a lick of common sense  
while supposedly doing serious research , the group sets up a circle of surveillance cameras in the ruins of the old house in the woods and vows to stay alert all night awaiting a visitation  
then they proceed to get totally trashed on drugs and alcohol and party down with very loud , very obnoxious heavy metal music  
it's a bad plan  
the cast shows some early promise  
a couple is doing research on a "" blair witch "" book  
the tour guide is a former mental patient turned ebay aficionado  
a goth amazon princess adds a bit of comedic relief  
the obligatory hot babe is the 2000 spiritual cinematic descendent of the cute hippie chick , the cute rock and roll chick and the cute disco chick : the cute wiccan chick  
the first film's unaccomplished actors came across as real people in a real situation because hours and hours of video were shot during days in the woods  
this time , these unaccomplished actors just come across as unaccomplished actors  
there's not one character you care about when they start shouting for no reason "

-1,"one of the responses those that enjoy "" detroit rock city "" ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i've given the film might be something like : "" oh , that casey's gone and become a jaded critic on us  
just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n' roll movie like this ? "" 
i'm wondering the same thing  
i feel like i should have had a grand time with "" detroit rock city  "" 
it's the sort of movie i wish i could've had a lot of fun with , but i didn't  
i just didn't  
surely this film isn't trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? 
no , but i expected something  
a funny joke  
a clever prank  
a plot development  
anything  
the movie never delivers  
you've got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing  
 "" detroit rock city "" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film's existence , and it's not a very satisfying realization  
the film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan  
that's it  
there is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot  
the characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington )  
they have a garage band  
they're pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n' roll , so i guess that means we root for them  
they have tickets , they lose them  
they get more tickets , they lose those too  
they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire  
there's not much more to it  
frankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity  
oh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency  
she doesn't want them to see kiss , if you hadn't figured that out already  
it's really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this  
we've got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy  
then again , "" maximum overdrive "" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time  
 "" detroit rock city "" doesn't quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close  
in fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind  
basically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc's "" highway to hell "" sounds like something my neighbor's cat coughed up )  
it's also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it' s evident that they're all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie  
edward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they've got to make a living in hollywood  
people wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song  
too bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess  
director adam rifkin knows he hasn't got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning  
we get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script  
it's fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting  
i would recommend that those who felt seasick at "" the blair witch project "" stay far away from "" detroit rock city , "" because the witch has got nothing on this baby  
i haven't felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since "" armageddon  "" 
and what about that script ? 
it's written by carl j  dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i've ever heard "

-1,"pre-review note : seeing as the only concern of body shots is "" sex "" , i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review  
because of this , i will try to vary word descriptions of "" sex "" ( meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms , and \ or your name is jerry falwell , you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen ) , so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend , fret not , it's most likely just another way of referring to "" sex ""  
i think we'd all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review  
though not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what  
body shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously , in the way you'd normally expect to see a violent attack  
it's about people who think about screwing , seek it out , and talk about it  
these are things we all do , sometimes  
the characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts  
their lives center around the next sexual encounter , but they seemed depressed  
it's as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek  
at its core body shots is a message movie , the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition  
michael cristoffer ( who directed gia , another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil ) is a moralist with nothing new to say  
his characters don't communicate anything of interest to each other , so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera  
they voice simplistic platitudes like "" i like to come "" or "" sex without love equals violence ""  
huh ? 
and yes that is as complex as this movie's observations get  
the characters are stupid and shallow , with not one registering as anything more  
the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure , then the after math ( the morning after ) of such events  
we meet the characters as they speak directly to us , confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy  
i would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them , giving you the pros and cons , but for this film i cannot  
i'm not trying to be clever or witty , but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others  
with the exception of trent ( played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman ) , the rest fade into each other-- a patchwork of fake breasts , defined abs , pearly white teeth , and creamy , flawless skin  
i vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one , only because his character gets the worst lines ( "" sex without love equals violence "" )  
in between all the confessionals , cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial , with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning  
the fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me  
this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining  
if body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f * * k-obsessed , fine , i don't have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way , but cristoffer only gives us one side  
additionally that one side isn't even entertaining ; the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness  
or realism  
one sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters  
they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason ( other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other ? ? ? alas , if it could only be that easy ? ? ? kidding of course ) , then , not only isn't it erotic , it isn't real  
it doesn't feel like an authentic sexual encounter  
every f * * k scene in this film ( and there are many ) is treated in the same unsexy manner  
body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film  
it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it , and most of all , it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it  
the resulting search for nookie ( and you can take that cookie ? ? ? ) over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow  
the main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred  
the film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape ( one where it is consensual the other where it is not ) and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off  
this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently , and if memory serves me i can't think of one film that has done so , and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80's next to wall street  
unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care , not the writer , the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off  
paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here , though boogie nights succeeded  
it was similarly moralistic , but it gave us two different viewpoints ; it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters , and it showed us the possible fall-out of such a decision  
the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here , but anderson seemed to care about them  
he gave them heart "

-1,"after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy , i was ready for some mindless fun--oh , maybe something like tango & cash  
maybe not ! 
mindless fun is one thing , but brain-dead slop is another matter altogether  
tango & cash has "" lowest common denominator "" written all over it  
the movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l  a  russell plays cash , a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts  
stallone plays tango , a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it ; he doesn't need the money  
in an effort to change his image , stallone goes for a yuppie , gq look in the film , wearing spectacles and three piece suits  
the two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names  
tango & cash is unbearably noisy  
for starters , there's harold faltermeyer's annoying synthesized score , which gets old after four notes  
to make matters worse , the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars , the more the merrier  
in fact , the movie begins with not one but two car chases  
there's nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie  
screenwriter randy feldman's brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv  
his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it , such as stallone's efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual  
in a movie with the iq level of an amoeba , even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent--and stallone is no lawrence olivier  
it's hard to imagine anyone reading feldman's script and thinking , "" i want to be in this movie  "" 
the film's plot doesn't have one original bone in its body , and--again--you have to point your finger at the screenwriting  
feldman's story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book , making tango & cash altogether generic and predictable  
they simply could have called it "" action movie  "" 
every character , every twist and turn , is stolen from television or from other movies  
adding insult to injury , tango & cash is about as believable as a "" road runner "" cartoon  
action movies don't have to be realistic , but they should absorb you enough so that you're not thinking about the lack of realism  
the only artistic aspect of tango & cash is the cinematography  
there are some spectacular shots , especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires  
the film's main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell  
unfortunately , their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants  
the dialogue consists of nothing but one-liners , and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing  
it's a shame because with a workable screenplay , russell and stallone could have turned tango & cash into a charming "" lethal weaponesque "" adventure  
tango & cash tries to maintain a light tone , and you do laugh about once every five minutes  
seeing russell in drag is the movie's funniest moment , but you probably already have seen it in the commercials  
furthermore , the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence  
machine guns and torture generally don't mix well with comedy  
jack palance appears in tango & cash doing what he does best : playing a sleazy , conniving villain  
his character , however , is run-of-the-mill , except for his strange obsession with mice  
like many movie villains , palance likes to play games  
in fact , he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash , a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room  
you have to wonder why palance doesn't just shoot the detectives in the head ! 
the story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent  
teri hatcher plays stallone's sister and russell's love-interest , and she is just as pretty as can be  
but regrettably , hatcher's acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty  
every time she opens her mouth , you cringe ; corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination  
there's really very little , if anything , to recommend in the film "

yes , despite being a third sequel to a successful original movie , the latest highlander doesn't seem to have anything going for it  
oh stinky movie , let me count thee ways    
plot : ( from what i understood ) a really bad highlander dude comes to the present looking to whack out the nice highlander dudes in order to gain their power and become the mightiest immortal    or 
something along those lines  
critique : a complete and utter mess  
disjointed , incoherent , boring , corny , filled with bad dialogue    and 
that's just the first thirty minutes ! 
this film doesn't seem to know what to do with itself  
it's confusing to anyone who doesn't know the series ( i include myself in that group ) and apparently idiotic to those who do know the series ( i include die-hard highlander fan the arrow in that group )  
the film doesn't explain anything about itself    it 
just goes from one inexplicable situation to another  
one moment they're in the present time , the next moment , they're in italy in the 1600s  
why ? 
who knows  
what are they talking about ? 
no idea  
flashbacks mixed in with the present , mixed in with a few spontaneously cheesy fight sequences every now and again , and i even remember seeing one flashback scene which went even further into its own flashback scene ! ! 
hullo    ? ! ? 
confused yet ? 
i was and i basically stopped giving a crap about anyone in the film when i realized that neither the writer or director was interested in presenting me with any kind of semblance of a story  
random swordplay , mad max-like dudes showing up in motorcycles in the 1800s ? 
or were they in the present at that time ? 
who knows    and to be honest    who 
seriously cares ! 
this series should have been shot in the head and put out of its own misery a long time ago , but sadly , someone at the studio decided that it still had a little life left in it  
please , please    for the love of god and all that is holy in the world of movie-making , and mostly out of respect for those who loved the original film , put this series to bed and end it ! 
even christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle to adrian paul in this one  
the director also tries to do the best he can with the muddled material , but all he could come up with is plenty of slo-mo action , some fast-motion fight scenes and lots of smoke everywhere  
and is there anything spectacular about the sword-play or fight scenes ? 
nope  
and i think we all could have done without all those zooming lambert face close-ups    yipes , 
the man is not aging gracefully , is he ? 
oh boy , and i haven't even gotten around to the greatest piece of over-acting that i've seen in years "

-1,"i've always been a kevin kline fan , silverado , fish called wanda , pirates of penzance , and even his hamlet on pbs' great performances  
the minute i saw the trailer for this film , i resolved to see it  
besides the fact that kline starred , it looked like a hilarious film  
i got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent , however , as i also thought , "" wow , if there's this much funny stuff in the trailer , there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film  "" 
 ( oops ) i packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo ( my name for our local multi-multi-plex  ) 
the film began     
the film concerns an english/drama teacher at a suburban high school , named howard brackett  
he loves poetry and great literary works , but his class is more interested in his famous former student , played by matt dillon  
 ( i'd put in his name , but my wife won't let me take notes during a movie and i've forgotten it  ) 
they continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him  
brackett has been engaged to another teacher ( played by joan cusack ) for three years , and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her  
the wedding , however , becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual  
kline spends most of the first two-thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn't  
the whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference  
his closest friends don't help matters , bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party  
there are some genuinely hilarous moments , one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity  
kline is hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck , who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out , while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations  
the movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding  
kline stands at the altar and is asked to take his vows    
if you want to be surprised , don't read , i am going to reveal the ending  
    instead of saying "" i do "" in front of his parents and most of the town , and even some cameras , he says "" i'm gay  "" 
this is where the movie , in my opinion falls apart  
most of the humor in the film had come from kline's insistence that he was straight , while at the same time , loving poetry and being a senstivie guy , dressing well , and occaisionally acting prissy  
it reminded me of the "" effeminate heterosexual "" sketch from saturday night live  
it was funny , it was sustainably funny , and kline's performance made it doubly so  
however , after the wedding , the film drags on  
they should have attempted to come to a quick conclusion , but it then gets into the serious side of what he's done  
he reconciles with his parents and his friends , some of which had turned on him  
there are several scenes which seemed like a waste of time , the scene with his mother and her friends , which was hilarious , seemed pointless , and the scene with tom selleck in the bar with joan seemed pointless  
finally , even though i am not catholic , i found the scene with the priest to be condescending  
the preist cannot believe that a man was engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship , proclaiming to brackett in the third person , "" he's gay  "" 
it got a chuckle from the audience , but i was distracted by it , and began to tire of the film  
by the time the wedding had come and gone , i found myself hoping it would be over soon  
 ( much like this review you are saying ) 
overall , if i have to quantify it , i say , rising action gets * * * * and climax and falling action gets  
see it in economy time "

-1,"an 80-year old woman jumps enthusiastically on her couch , wearing tight-fitting leather , as she cheers on her favorite tv wrestler by calling his opponent a `pump-bitch'  
two men messily eat fast food as their septic truck leaks raw sewage directly behind them  
and roughly 17 people are booted in the crotch  
welcome to `ready to rumble'  
judging from the fact that potty-mouth adam sandler is the reigning box-office comedy champion , you realize -- albeit while shaking your head -- that yes , there is an audience for this sort of thing  
ladies and gentlemen , i weep for society  
mind you , when executed with style and comic ingenuity , jokes like an alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel ( `there's something about mary' ) and a laxative-induced attack of explosive diarrhea ( `dumb and dumber' ) can be extremely funny  
unfortunately , `ready to rumble' is not being helmed by the farrelly brothers , nor is it bolstered by a script that accommodates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or inspired  
`ready to rumble' is built around the dedicated fan-base of professional wrestling     
which , in fact , sounded like a fine concept for a goofball comedy  
but director brian robbins and screenwriter steven brill handcuff themselves , and limited to a stampede of asinine , humdrum bathroom humor , basically the only thing they manage is to evoke memories of pauly shore and `bio dome'  
gordie boggs ( david arquette ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) take pride in being hardcore wcw wrestling fanatics  
by day , they transport raw sewage  
by night ( particularly on ? nitro' monday ) , they pay homage to their personal hero and savior - jimmy king ( oliver platt ) , the undisputed leader of the professional wrestling community  
with two tickets to an upcoming nitro performance , gordie and sean are psyched about witnessing the king defend his title first-hand  
but unscrupulous boxing kingpin titus sinclair ( joe pantoliano , sporting long hair and cowboy boots ) has other plans  
sinclair is plotting to have diamond dallas page ( playing himself ) pummel the king into the tarp , thereby dethroning the dignified wrestler and embarrassing him in front of a bewildered auditorium full of fans  
gordie and sean are shocked , rioting madly while arguing `this isn't even a pay-per view event ! ! ' 
they take it upon themselves to track the king down and supply the encouragement essential for their fallen idol to make a come-back attempt  
along the way , you can expect a lot of sh-- jokes as well  
you may find something to like in `ready to rumble' if a ) you are a rasslin' aficionado yourself , or b ) you are a dedicated fan of the lowest of low-brow comedies  
i welcome low-brow humor with open arms - that is , if its fresh and resourceful  
`rumble' is nothing but a sloppy , frightfully unfunny swamp land of misbegotten retardation  
the first half-hour is the ultimate test of patience  
luckily , the simple-minded events pick up steam , particularly with the well-choreographed wrestling action  
director robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality and excitement of football in `varsity blues' , and when in the ring , he does professional work  
but the violence is too excessive  
having the fake soap opera of wcw wrestling turn into a bloody skirmish brings back unfortunate memories of owen hart's tragic accident just last year , especially with one character's dive during a cage match  
this is not something you want a comedy to be reminiscent of  
outside the wrestling action , the lewd jokes and puerile sight gags bring new meaning to the term ? scattershot' , while the dialogue fluctuates in on the vulgarity scale of 1 to 10 , with brill's extensive vocabulary ranging from `diddly' to `boob' and so on  
the final tally : i chuckled a few times , groaned a lot , and indulged in one spirited belly laugh involving martin landau as a geriatric wrestling coach who fights pretty impressively for 105  
casting-wise , `ready to rumble' is an odd duck  
oliver platt as a champion wrestling figure ? 
he's perhaps a bit chunky , but fellow wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him `fatty' , which dampens the blow i suppose  
rose mcgowan is fully disposable as a sultry wcw cheerleader ( `the nirto-est of the nitro girls , ' proclaims gordie ) , but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers goldberg , `macho man' randy savage and sting ( among others )  
wcw fans are sure to appreciate these  
others    
well , won't

-1,"this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney's live- action george of the jungle  
tarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough's legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far  
badly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves  
i have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie  
furthermore , it's even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence  
and , while i'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production  
of course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film's troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line  
imagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like  
with its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse  
anyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect  
the only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors )  
the film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough  
instead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a  k  a  john clayton a  k  a  tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march )  
he is living happily in england , enjoying the benefits of being a land-owning noble  
meanwhile , in central africa , the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington ) , a self-proclaimed scholar and explorer , believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar , which he calls the cradle of civilization  
on the way there , he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things , like burning native villages , to earn the wrath of the locals  
one shaman , determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal , sends a mystical message to tarzan for help  
with lady jane following close behind , he returns to the jungle where he was born  
its patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty-boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability  
with his plastic facial expressions , monotone voice , and complete inability to make convincing animal noises , his range rivals that of steven seagal  
his pecs , however , are impressive , and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off  
jane march , on the other hand , has to keep her shirt on , which may be a first for her  
some six years ago , march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud's steamy the lover  
since then , she made the career-killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night , which exploited her every acting defiency  
tarzan continues this trend  
march may be attractive , but , at least judging by this performance , she can't act  
meanwhile , steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy  
instead , he turns out to be little more than a nuisance  
the story line is pure formula , which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies  
the problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless  
the romantic elements are all contrived ? in fact , lady jane's presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance  
the special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel ( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes ? apparently , animatronics were too expensive for this production )  
and , of course , as with all jungle movies , there are the obligatory cute animals  
over the years , the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material  
the most famous ape man was johnny weismuller , but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part ( including gordon scott , who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role )  
weismuller made 12 tarzan features ; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number  
and , having seen tarzan and the lost city , i would argue that the movie-going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 "
-1,"do the folks at disney have no common decency ? 
they have resurrected yet another cartoon and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects , embarrassing writing and kid-friendly slapstick  
wasn't mr  magoo enough , people ? 
obviously not  
inspector gadget is not what i would call ideal family entertainment  
younger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding goofiness , but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80-minute exercise in glaring stupidity  
the movie is poorly edited , grossly manipulative , and the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle  
all the elements are there , but the manner in which director david kellogg pieces them together is laughable and trite  
as a huge fan of the 80's animated tv show , the first thing i must express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain  
in the cartoon , dr  claw was a frightening , raspy-voiced presence who remained a total mystery to the viewer  
we never saw his face ; he simply sat back in his arm-chair , watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his loyal cat  
as a child , i always imagined what dr  claw would appear as - and this curiosity kept me watching for many years  
with the release of the live-action movie , the face of this once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed - it's    
rupert everett ? ! 
only now , dr  claw is simply known as claw ( `one word , ' he explains , `like madonna' )  
he sports a shiny clamp instead of the steel glove , and seems far less interesting than the animated version  
it helps that the dashing everett is enthusiastic , but he overplays the role entirely too far  
when all is said and done , this wasn't a very wise move on the part of the screenwriters - the infamous dr  claw has been turned into a wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and cool  
he does still have his cat , though  
in the title role , matthew broderick looks lost  
the actor , while usually downright charming , doesn't know exactly where to take his character - a fault that again can be blamed on the hapless writers  
broderick first plays a friendly , naive security guard named john brown , who dreams of becoming a cop and upholding the law for the good of the people  
he has a mad crush on pretty scientist brenda ( joely fisher ) , who has stumbled upon a new wave of technology involving the interaction of human tissue and electronics  
but one fateful night , her lab is destroyed and her experiment is stolen by a fiendish millionaire ( everett ) who wants to take over the world  
john courageously pursues the limousine from the scene of the crime , but loses the chase when his vehicle bursts into flames  
in a full body cast , he is chosen to be the first human prototype for brenda's work ; a revolutionary crime fighting tool with numerous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys  
and so is born inspector gadget  
as bad as this movie is , it does have a certain charm in isolated scenes  
broderick actually fares better playing robo gadget , an evil and destructive clone that claw has set loose on the city  
and there are about two or three amusing punch lines , the funniest being when robo gadget impersonates a rampaging monster with shadow puppets on a brick wall , and a japanese man flees the scene while screaming , `this is why i left tokyo ! ' 
alas , the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to 1 in favor of not even cracking a slight giggle  
there are so many tired plot additions  
gadget's talking car ( voiced by d  l  
hughley ) is the same type of character as zoot the suit from my favorite martian  
both are wisecracking , non-human additions designed to coax laughter from smaller children  
well , it just doesn't work ( in fact , zoot functioned marvelously in comparison to this )  
and don't even get me started about the villains  
i didn't mind everett's performance , but his bumbling assistants will make every adult cringe with disgust  
the characters from the cartoon have been reduced to thankless supporting roles "
-1,"as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment , hollywood doesn't loose the oppertunity to get involved , by telling stories and expressing opinions  
this film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels , hays hodges ( tommy lee jones ) and terry childers ( samuel l  jackson )  
they fought side by side in vietnam , where childers saved hodges' life by shooting an unarmed pow  
that's against the rules of war but understandable , in this story anyway , under the specific circumstances  
certainly hodges is not complaining  
years pass  
hodges , whose wounds make him unfit for action , gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer  
childers , is now a respected and much-decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould  
because of his excellent record , childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ( ben kingsley ) , cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops  
childers does what he has to do : evacuate the family and protect the men under his command  
after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire , he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd  
more than 80 yemeni men , women , and children are mowed down  
childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians  
he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film  
did childers violate authorized u  s  military rules of engagement ? 
or are there simply no rules in war ? 
the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious , but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions  
the murder of 83 "" innocent civilians "" has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u  s  where is the accusations from the arab leaders ? 
where is the u  n  ? 
the film ends without even telling the most interesting story : what happens on the international arena ? 
this film ( in a way akin to films such as "" a few good men "" ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism  
these accusations are pretty heavy , but also unfair  
what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking  
one of the earliest apparent problems with 'rules of engagement' is its lack of credibility  
the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now , but is overdone , contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed  
a lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality  
that is precisely why it's not offensive  
it is completely unobjective  
many stories are started and never finished  
many questions are asked , but never answered  
a lot of parallels are referring to nothing  
it seems that neither the director , producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film  
is it about arab mentality ? 
america's foreign policies ? 
america's role in the world ? 
corruption in the higher circles ? 
it goes on and on  
it consists of countless stories , but not a definable plot  
it tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one  
i think that it is ironic , because director william friedkin's probably most acclaimed film was "" the exorcist "" which had a silly story , but became a rather effective film  
in this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film  
though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism ( such as the impressive battle scenes ) , his latest film does simply not engage  
i believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed  
it's obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe  
the characters feel designed , unreal , merely shadows , with no life outside the conflict "

-1,"teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood  
every year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular , and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights , wallets in hand  
the formula is very simple , you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal  
you add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds , and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes , the typical teenage attention span  
the response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any = film set in an environment they can relate to , and , most importantly , they don92t care to judge films=92 quality , so any piece of trash will = due  
that is just what never been kissed , the latest film from director raja gosnell , is ; trash  
josie geller ( drew barrymore ) is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times  
she has her own personal assistant , unlimited supplies , and her own office  
but she is very much dismayed with her position in life  
there is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field , where she can play a more active role in the chicago media  
so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere , she jumps at it with elation  
constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita ( molly shannon ) and her amicable superior , gus ( john c  reilly )  
the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment , as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter  
however , since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict , this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes , and josie is headed for the field  
obviously , the field assignment involves a high school  
specifically , she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school , by enrolling in the senior class and "" becoming one of them  "" 
i don92t think that i = need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring , so i won92t  
the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school  
interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was , and she appears to be heading down that road again  
fortunately for this lame production , other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting  
they include the predictable love stories , between both a student ( jeremy jordan ) and a teacher ( michael vartan ) , to show that josie is really two people in one body  
also , her younger brother and opposite , rob ( david arquette ) comes into her new found life and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative  
the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing  
typical for teenage films , it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor  
one scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical  
most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy  
but those still don92t = recover for the total lack of quality in this movie  
following this trend of high school movie rules , comes the general acting  
it is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film  
in this case , drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch  
she is required to play her character on two levels , having some very black and white transitions  
and although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray , she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time  
at one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel , and is expected to him on an adult level , since he is one , her teacher  
but she never seems to get out of the gray area , and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good performance  
following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon ( saturday night live )  
she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to , and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic  
it is these "" qualities "" that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent  
luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film  
david arquette ( scream ) takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic , and not have his brilliant acting ruined  
and as a central character he gets to take on his own mini-plot , which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed  
in a dazzling cherry-on-the-sundae type piece of work , he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit , risky business  
never been kissed is a mediocre film at best "

-1,"well , what are you going to expect ? 
it's a movie about a big snake that eats people  
that's what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film , because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more  
instead , i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me , too  
anaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river  
led by anthropologists dr  steven cale ( eric stolz ) and terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives  
along the way , they find poacher paul sarone ( jon voight ) , and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda  
to simply say that this is the world's largest snake wouldn't be doing it justice , since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide  
if this isn't a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers , i don't know what is  
at the beginning of anaconda , we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past , but that seems to be more or less over now  
i expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line , but it ended up being a set-up for nothing  
cale chokes on a deadly wasp ( don't ask me how that happens - i don't know ) and is put out of action , relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help  
this minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot , since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone's plan to capture the snake  
however , this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film , and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle  
most bad characters are either annoying or stupid  
in this movie , they're both  
since this description applies to all the characters except sarone , it's hard to find someone to root for  
you're supposed to back the good guys , but you really end up cheering for sarone because he's smarter than everyone else  
or maybe he's just not as dumb as everyone else  
at times , i almost found myself rooting for the snake  
there are no standout performances here  
everyone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters  
even voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason  
no matter , as in most monster movies , the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway  
in most of the scenes , the snake is computer generated , and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real  
however , the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences  
sometimes , for example , the snake just moves too fast  
it catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall , for crying out loud  
then there's another scene where the snake eats one of the characters , and we see the snake's skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim's pained expression from within the snake's belly  
absolutely ridiculous  
a testimony to the film's bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film , where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is  
in a scene totally unrelated to anything else , we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther  
the anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard , one of the panther's eyeballs pops out  
eeeewwwww  
above and beyond the sick factor , however , this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed  
in films like these , a sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained  
if the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see , we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them  
to show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don't know about , and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown  
in a case like that , the showdown just ends up being a letdown  
when i saw the snake for the first time , i decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake i saw wasn't the real danger  
this one was just a decoy , and there was actually a bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe  
no such luck  
okay , maybe anaconda is actually a decoy , and there's really a better movie waiting to make its debut "

-1,"if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films , i might say that i review movies that don't look particularly good because i'm doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it  
if that were true , i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads : "" shay casey : seeing bad movies so you don't have to  "" 
but i know that's bunk-you're going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say  
so i have to tell the truth : every once in a while i get a nasty , masochistic urge to see a bad movie  
you know the feeling , when you're sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly  
sometimes i think that's why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies , ever  
admit it : sometimes you like seeing bad movies  
so do i  
so i saw "" supernova  "" 
truth be told , "" supernova "" wasn't quite as bad as i thought it might be  
maybe i just felt sorry for the actors , or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn't started tinkering with the director's ( walter hill ) final cut , causing him to want his name removed  
maybe i'm becoming a softy  
in any case , i didn't find "" supernova "" as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe  
but it's still bad  
the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel "" nightingale  "" 
the crew includes captain a  j  
marley ( robert forster ) , his new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) and danika lund ( robin tunney ) , and computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz )  
there are some attempts at "" characterization , "" but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female )  
don't expect any more explanation , because you won't get it  
anyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent  
during the dimension jump ( i think that's what it's called , but don't hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board  
he calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with  
then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening  
have you seen "" alien ? "" 
have you seen "" event horizon "" ( a lame movie in its own right ) ? 
good  
then you've seen "" supernova  "" 
post-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either  
after all , no one's going to think for a second that troy won't turn out to be a villain  
but the bigger problem with "" supernova "" is that it can' t just stick to the simple plot it's afforded  
numerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it's a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped  
was there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ? 
did the ship's computer learn something about humanity ? 
what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ? 
and just what does the film's title signify , if anything ? 
as far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn't developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements  
character relationships in this film also make very little sense  
for some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex  
we get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes  
bassett and spader's characters start off hating each other  
fifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they're engaging in some hanky-panky  
when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him  
every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut  
the most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits ! 
furthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits  
maybe that's why the film's title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster  
right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you're seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations  
the rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b  point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby "

in the early to mid 1400's , there was little in the way of spiritual light to be found shining from the heart of a man or woman  
the church was a dismally dark and oppressive place  
france was involved in "" the hundred years war "" against england  
there was no strong political leadership in the country  
morale was low , there being little hope for the future  
it was within this setting that a young french girl began hearing "" voices "" and seeing "" visions  "" 
convinced that these were messages from god , she brazenly demanded to see the dauphin in order to deliver the message directly to him  
the message : if he would give her an army to command , she would deliver to him the crown  
he does    
and she does  
then , once seated on the throne , he abandons her to her english captors  
director luc besson ( the fifth element ) may have co-wrote the script but he never appeared to have a proper handle on the material  
the inconsistencies of the cast , the confusing blur of the violent battle scenes , the inappropriate musical score , and the lack of a vibrant life force at the center of the film adds up to a largely disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable  
his biggest miscue was to cast his wife , milla jovovich ( the fifth element ) in the title role  
ms  jovovich , looks spectacular as joan , clad in battle armor , astride a similarly protected horse  
if looks were enough to fully convey a character , she would have been brilliant  
since it isn't , she tried ( and failed ) to act the part  
her joan is unbalanced , "" inspiring "" the troops merely by screaming stridently and waving her banner or sword over her head like a woman possessed  
john malkovich ( being john malkovich ) fares a bit better as the dauphin , who joan would see on the throne as charles vii  
an easily manipulated man , his weakness of character foreshadows the betrayal of joan which would lead to her death  
faye dunaway ( the thomas crown affair ) gives a strong performance in minimal screen time as the dauphin's mother-in-law and chief advisor  
the army under joan's command are comprised of comical figures , more stooges than soldiers  
the one exception would be tcheky karyo ( la femme nikita ) as dunois , the man who was leading the attack prior to joan's arrival  
trying to plan a systematic campaign , he sees his leadership authority negated by joan's insistence on following her "" visions  "" 
dustin hoffman ( sphere ) has a small inhuman role as joan's conscience which begins speaking to her while awaiting trial  
dressed like cloaked monk , he leads her to doubt herself and her "" revelations  "" 
as well she should  
scriptures do speak of revelation  
god , via his gift of holy spirit , is able to communicate to men  
three of the nine manifestations of holy spirit listed in 1 corinthians 12 deal with receiving revelation  
they are : word of knowledge , word of wisdom , and discerning of spirits  
even the scriptures themselves are a result of god giving revelation to his "" holy men    
who spake as they were moved by holy spirit ( i  e  
by revelation  ) "" 
but the scriptures also caution us : 
 "" beloved , believe not every spirit , but try the spirits whether they are of god : because many false prophets are gone out into the world  "" 
1 john 4 : 1 [kjv] 
joan's end , ( being burned at the stake at the age of 19 ) , the frenzy ( mob rule ) and blood lust her inspiration wrought , and the death , pain , or suffering which followed her campaign all point to a devilish influence rather than a godly one "

-1,"i think that saying that the x-files is one of this summer's most anticipated films is safe  
for five years , "" the x-files "" television show has developed a dedicated fan culture , whose rabid devotion to the series rivals that of "" star trek "" fans  
the premise of both the movie and the television series is two fbi agents who investigate the paranormal ; fox mulder ( david duchovny ) is the avid believer whose quest to find the truth about extraterrestrial life borders on the paranoid , and dana scully ( gillian anderson ) is the scientific skeptic trying to find a rational explanation to mulder's flights of fancy  
outlining the plot of the x-files movie is virtually impossible , since to be general would result in confusion , yet to be specific would give too much away  
nevertheless , i will try  
 "" the black ooze , "" and extraterrestrial , virus-like substance is threatening earth  
a "" shadow government "" is aware of this , but tries to cover-up the alien existence  
mulder and scully know "" the truth is out there , "" and so try to expose both the invasion and the cover-up  
there are three central questions i have heard asked about this movie : 1  
will those who don't watch the series be able to understand the movie ? 
yes  
isolated as an individual text , the x-files can stand alone  
they have given enough background for anyone , familiar with the show or not , to understand the movie  
although some of the secondary characters' histories may confuse the uninitiated , those characters are not essential to the film  
this is a major problem : they trot out token secondary characters from the series out for an appearance and then disappear just as quickly  
why bring superintendent skinner into the picture in the first place , and then have him sat silently on an fbi internal affairs committee ? 
why bring in "" the lone gunmen , "" three computer geek conspiracy theorists , for an even briefer appearance ? 
these characters are recurrent on the series , and their appearance in the film was met with whoops from the audience ( suggesting their popularity among fans - actually most of the audience could pass for "" the lone gunmen "" )  
still , then they vanish just as quickly  
2  the television show never gives us any answers  
will the movie actually explain some things ? 
yes  
in the x-files we get a fairly complete history of "" the black ooze , "" what it is and what it wants  
we finally get some understanding of the motivations behind the "" shadow government  "" 
there are even some subtle tie-ins with contemporary ufo-ology , including the "" greys "" and the roswell crash of 1947  
3  is the movie any good ? 
no  the x-files is a dreadful movie and shows some fundamental problems with writer/creator chris carter's talents and the relationship between cinema and television  
first off , the screenplay by series creator chris carter is sloppy and cliched  
after approximately forty-five minutes ( the length of a television episode minus the commercials ) , the pace drops to a snail's crawl  
not long after that point , when carter attempts to answer some questions we have had about the series , we wish he had not  
the explanations are so trite and ridiculous that one would have preferred it had carter not explained quite so much  
i am willing to suspend my disbelief a fair bit , but the absurdity carter wants me to swallow was just too much  
breaking the suspension of disbelief destroys the movie - and listening to other fans leave the cinema , maybe the series too  
the explanations are not only absurd , they are tired and unoriginal  
the extraterrestrials breed and gestate like those from the alien series , and their craft looks like a leftover set piece from independence day  
note that the alien movies , id4 , and the x-files are all from 20thcentury fox - a studio that is beginning to cannibalize itself i think  
the x-files is noteworthy for being the only movie based on a television series to be produced while the series was still running  
in comparing the movie and television series certain aspects of the respective media emerge  
the avoidance of the series to answer the questions it raised annoyed and frustrated many people  
however , i rather liked that about the series  
television allows you to impose as much , or as little , meaning on a show as you want  
it is the proverbial "" blank screen "" which we project our minds on  
meaning on television is open and ambiguous ; it is the nature of the medium  
cinema , on the other hand , is the opposite  
it projects onto us the filmmakers mind "

us distribution : 20th century fox rated pg : mild violence , thematic elements 
copyright 1999 nathaniel r  atcheson 
a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review  
i've attempted to obey this rule in recent months , but to do so would be impossible in this case  
the fact is , nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them  
the original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people  
for me , they calibrated my creativity as a child ; they are masterful , original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time ( and they still hold up pretty darn well )  
i am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release , but that doesn't make me any less dedicated to it  
on the contrary , the star wars trilogy -- and the empire strikes back in particular -- are three items on a very short list of why i love movies  
when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine-film series , i got exited  
when i first saw screenshots from the film , well over a year ago , i embarked on a year-long drool of anticipation  
and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving , i was ready to see the film  
but then there was the hype , the insane marketing campaign , and lucasfilm's secretive snobbery over the picture  
in the last weeks before the picture opened , while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater , i was tired of hearing about it  
i was tired of seeing cardboard cut-outs of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell  
i just wanted to see the movie  
reader , do not misunderstand  
i did not have an anti-hype reaction  
the hype was unavoidable  
i understand and accept the hype -- it's just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released  
five minutes into the phantom menace , i knew there was a problem  
 "" who are these jedi knights ? "" 
i asked  
 "" why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine-gun rapidity ? "" 
 "" why aren't these characters being developed before their adventures ? "" 
 "" why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film ? "" 
these were just some of my questions early on  
later , i asked , "" where's the magic of the first three films ? "" 
and "" why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes ? ' 
by the end of the film , i was tired , maddened , and depressed  
george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless , mindless , summer blockbuster  
the phantom menace is no star wars film  
take away the title and the jedi talk and the force , and you're left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time  
it's an embarrassment  
i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored , or a new theme is examined , or a special effects shot isn't used  
there are a few of each , but they're all token attempts  
the fact is , george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects  
this is not what i wanted to see  
i didn't want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth , but i did  
the story centers mostly around qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson , looking lost and confused ) and his apprentice , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor , who scarcely has a line in the film ) and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo  
naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation ; their contact on naboo is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people  
after picking up jar jar binks ( a completely cgi character , voiced by ahmed best ) , they head to tatooine , where they meet young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his mother ( pernilla august )  
qui-gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin , and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys  
the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious , neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters  
there isn't anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form  
the way lucas has handled it , however , it unsatisfactory  
first of all , we don't learn one single thing about qui-gon jinn  
not one thing "

comments : watchers reborn , a cheaply made direct-to-video turkey , is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontz's bestselling novel watchers  
technically , this should have been called watchers v , but it seems that this cycle of horror movies , much like many other sequel-crazy film series , has decided to drop the numbers from the titles  
 ( even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi  ) 
the makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago  
this really isn't a good movie  
have you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation ? 
well , any hope a viewer may have had , perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill , will be dashed by the time he's seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn  
they're awful  
these commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer , some weird crap about a dead indian , teens , and wolves , and an "" action "" movie called detonator starring scott baio  
scott baio ! 
what idiot dreamed this movie up ? 
after surviving these abysmal trailers , the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented : watchers reborn  
 "" maybe it won't be * that * bad "" he may say to himself  
 "" perhaps , just perhaps , the bottom-of-the-barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading  
watchers reborn , after all , is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago  
it stars mark hamill -- luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy  
lou rawls is even in the mix ! "" 
unfortunately , the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill ( he looks very sick here ) , and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers , the book  
the latter is really too bad  
koontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good , but he is still my favorite hack writer  
koontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful  
people who read many of his books , however , often complain of repetitive plot devices  
it's definately not a koontz book if there isn't ( 1 ) a psychic , ( 2 ) a super-intelligent dog , or ( 3 ) a psychotic killer who likes ripping out people's eyeballs  
watchers has all three devices , which may explain why it's arguably the most popular of koontz's books  
the idea behind koontz's novel , though highly implausible , is very interesting  
basically , a biological war machine is created : a smart dog can be released in battle , track down its target , and then relay the target's position , psychically , to a large creature designed to kill in hand-to-hand combat  
silly but kind of neat too  
i'm sorry  
i don't mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn , the movie  
i suppose i just don't want to talk about the movie itself  
this turkey is really cheesy  
no one in this movie can act , including mark hamill , and it's difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero  
the cheese factor is only increased when he's involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist / geneticist / zoologist / whatever-the-f * * k-she's-supposed-to-be whom he befriends  
mercifully , the filmmakers opted not to do nudity  
to be honest , the only half-convincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein  
you know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts  
i find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie  
and the creature ! 
yes , the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling  
this creature is shot about 500 , 000 times , but it's okay  
the creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing  
oh , he can also rip body parts off , allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around  
cheesy gore  
that's another main element of watchers reborn  
it has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the film's campiness rather than its suspense "
-1,"years ago , robin williams made _jumanji_ , a brilliant achievement in special effects , but a travesty on nearly every other level  
the same can be said for _what dreams may come_ , a boring , illogical , weepie-wannabe that left my senses numb  
don't get me wrong : i love breathtaking special effects and pulse-pounding imagery  
_brazil_ is on my personal top ten  
_the city of lost children_ is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios  
i even love _2001_ and _last year at marienbad_ , being in the minority amidst my friends  
_what dreams may come_ , imagery aside , has little daring thought to complement its imagery  
the daring thought it _does_ have is never fully realized  
it's idea of a plot is so lukewarm , that it insults the bigger questions it raises  
it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences , put on an electronica soundtrack , and sell it as one of those popular _mind's eye_ videos  
robin williams plays chris nielsen , who dies too prematurely--not only in the story , but before we have a chance to really know and care for him  
the director , vincent ward , and the screenwriter ronald bass , have chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience with the afterlife  
big mistake  
it would have been far better to take the half-hour or so needed to tell his life story first ( ala _it's a wonderful life_ ) , so that i can build up respect for him , so i could know and possibly care for him , his children , and his long-suffering wife ( played superbly by annabella sciorra )  
instead , the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story , expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses  
it doesn't  
so in the afterlife , chris learns that ( a ) people still don't meet god , ( b ) that our thoughts are reality , and ( c ) time does not exist there  
hmm    
i+ll grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative  
 ( the "" not meeting god "" part still irks at me , but perhaps there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect )  
that said , this alternate reality still makes no possible sense  
read on    
chris' wife commits suicide  
since suicides go to hell , chris would be separated from his wife forever  
the important question is , is heaven really heaven if you are separated from the one you love ? 
good question  
and i like good thought-provoking questions  
i don+t like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question  
i _loathe_ it when the filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes a popular rescue film , especially a rescue film which does not take its underlying premise seriously  
i _really_ loathe it when it+s story is no longer run by logic , but by special effects  
hey chris : did you forget ? 
your thoughts are _real_  
they are more _real_ than the physical world , according to the new-age screenplay  
so , why don+t you conjure up positive thoughts of annie , and let that run wild ? 
and then she would appear before you , and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity ? 
because there would be no movie , that+s why  
and albert the angel ( played by miscast cuba gooding , jr  ) says bluntly : "" that+s fantasy  "" 
umm    
if your thoughts are more real than the physical , then fantasy is not fantasy , but real  
surely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that "
-1,"capsule : the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith's films gets their own movie  
the gags are sporadically funny  
it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti-gay jokes  
the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team  
the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film  
sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching  
this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night  
 ( and it turns out he had very good reasons  ) 
 , low 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 
a film needs a plot  
it needs characters for empathy value  
it needs a story and an emotional center  
if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are  
kevin smith has now made two satisfying films , clerks and chasing amy  
with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp  
peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled  
but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith's fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it  
his remaining two films , mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience  
jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes , penis jokes , flatulence jokes , film pastiches , and in-jokes  
how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call  
for me , the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny  
there was not enough cleverness or variety  
it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay  
penis jokes work only so many times  
showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags  
they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford , the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post-war films including dead of night , the lady vanishes , and passport to pimlico  
jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners  
as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts  
in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads  
jay and silent bob ( played by jason mewes and kevin smith ) are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks  
this leaves them at loose ends  
they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie  
they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash  
so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way  
the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood 
the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny  
silent bob , being silent , can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his  
this makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have  
jay has to be the comic  
he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive  
the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny  
he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair  
so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team  
their starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before--sometimes just minutes before  
like dogma before it , but definitely not like chasing amy , this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie "

-1,"i've never written a review for a movie i haven't watched all the way through , but i had to make an exception with powder  
i was about forty-five minutes into this one at a friend's house when he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house  
so i never got to finish the movie and i'm sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of a bad movie  
but i can at least get a partial review out of it , because i saw enough to know this one wasn't worth finishing in the first place  
the movie centers around a freaky teenager who's spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents' house  
when grandpa dies ( taking his department store down with him ) , social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder ( first and middle names ? 
gold bond ) to a state home , where we find out he's a different from the other kids  
actually , we find out he's different when we first see him , because he's the most pale individual we've ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever  
when powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie , the father takes one look at him and says "" he's not my son  "" 
obviously  
all i want to know is where the pillsbury dough boy was nine months ago  
so the white-faced freak leaves his neverland ranch for the state home and faces the ridicule of other kids  
that is , until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him "" wear "" his spoon ( "" you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass  "" 
decisions , decisions    ) and he uses telepathic powers to draw all the silverware in the room into a giant pile in the middle of the table  
so if his father is the pillsbury dough boy , his mother must be sissy spacek's carrie character  
and you have to factor in two more things from the subsequent scenes , as we find out powder has some sort of super-intelligence ( "" your i  q  
test went straight off the chart ! "" ) 
and attracts electrical power  
this first shows up as powder visits the world of high school ( if he's such a genius already , why would he need a high school education ? ) and sits through a demonstration in jeff goldblum's science class  
goldblum plugs in a "" jacob's ladder "" device that shows current running up two wires and immediately the current flows across the room and into powder's chest  
but goldblum just stands there for about thirty seconds watching , instead of just unplugging the damn thing  
i guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in a row ( following hideaway and nine months )  
that's about all i saw before the big fight began and , let me tell you , that was twice as interesting as the movie itself  
but like i said , i saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization  
none of these movies ever handle the subject properly , instead introducing the feeble beauty and the beast copout of having a beautiful woman fall in love with the guy's personality , overlooking his personal appearance  
i already had the female character picked out ( the girl who was sitting next to him in the back of the room during the electrocution scene ) , but i guess i'll never know for sure what happened

-1,"martial arts master steven seagal ( not to mention director ! ) has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights , talks in a hushed tone , and squints at any sign of danger  
he's also the most consistent individual in hollywood today , since all his movies suck  
they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art ( that is , martial art )  
i'm sure the guy's good , and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows , although a tad haughty , but these movies he makes are all the same : a guy who is basically indestructable , is maybe wounded supposedly mortally , then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses ( although i kinda liked "" under siege "" )  
of course , this one , as a change , has a "" message "" that is drilled into our mind    of 
course , after he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people  
so why do i watch his crap ? 
i usually don't  
i will never , and you can hold me to this , i will never pay to see this man's movies , unless , and only unless , he's in a supporting role ( i  e  
 "" executive decision "" ) and i'd definitely pay if he dies ( i  e  
 "" executive decision "" )  
but this one has a special place in my heart  
this doesn't mean it's good or that i even liked it  
this was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle , and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la "" mystery science theatre 3000 , "" and this was a couple years before i had heard of "" mystery science theatre 3000  "" 
in this one , seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased-up typical shallow villain , this time played by an oscar-winner to give the movie some more clout - michael caine  
it seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land  
around the 20-30 minute point , seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs ( what with his new "" fire down below , "" another "" message film "" ) , and caine has him bumped off    or 
does he ? 
seagal is rescued by some inuits , and falls in love with one of them , played by joan chen , who can act , hypothetically , but , for some reason , not here  
one of caine's cliched henchmen ( played here with a lot of overacting by john c  mcginley ) shoots the cheif of the inuit clan , and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory    literally , 
of course  
at one point , seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn't have any options but blow stuff up  
he even goes as far as to say , "" i don't want to kill someone , "" and in the same breath , he asks some guy where the arsenal is  
i have no problem with violence  
i'm a huge john woo fan , but he paints his films with suspense , skill , style , depth , characterization , and just plain cool violence  
in the films of seagal , the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly , and him either wounding or killing them  
at some points , they use the cliche of the talking villain , where the villain has the advantage , can shoot seagal , but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan , or saying a corny line , to which seagal says something hokey back , and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them , and does  
this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn't take itself seriously at all , like in the case of this summer's "" con air  "" 
but seagal is serious about his skill , and of course , his message  
i wouldn't mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence  
but seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle , not pounded into the viewer's mind  
the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish , thus we can't take him and his motives seriously , and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment , he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig , and kills some workers who were just doing his job  
then at the end , he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech , just in case you didn't get the message from the trailers  
what seagal doesn't realize is that no one takes his films seriously ( although maybe a couple do ) and any message he has is no only redundant , but doesn't comfortably fit in his film , which is filled to the brim with hokey violence , crap suspense , stupid melodrama , and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish  
as far as seagal and his acting , he's rather boring  
he squints , he kills "

-1,"there's a scene somewhere in this film where one of the characters reads the book "" screenwriting made easy  "" 
this is funny the first time just 'cause it is , but funnier as the film goes on since it's totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it , outlined it and then wrote this film  
it's like they took the sub-genre of the disaster pic , which can be fun and hokey at the same time , and then forgot one of the greatest parts of them : the stupid , eccentric characters  
yes , "" the poseidon adventure "" is crap , but it's fun 'cause of all the stupid , eccentric characters  
and "" earthquake , "" my god ! 
 "" earthquake "" has got to be one of the worst movies of all time , but at least they had the joke of having charlton heston sleeping with genevieve bujold  
 "" volcano "" takes a semi-intriguing yet stupendously inane plot ( a volcano no one knew about suddenly errupts one fine morning and then erupts again later then stops    only 
it's in , dare i say it ? 
l  a ! ! ! ) and then puts no stupid , stereotypical , eccentric characters in it  
they're just stupid  
and the actors are all good ones  
tommy lee jones is great , an oscar winner , and a member of the men in black ( my vote for what should be the coolest movie of the summer )  
anne heche is a good indy actress  
don cheadle stole the disappointing "" devil in a blue dress "" from denzel's feet  
and gaby's one of the few good teenage actors  
but they get nothing to do but act dumb and scream at what's going on  
they do their best , god bless them , but they're all lost in the fake magma ( only don cheadle gets an interesting part and he's the greatest part of the film )  
there's no real suspense here 'cause you don't care about anyone  
i actually was rooting for gaby's character to get killed so tommy lee jones wouldn't have to keep saving her ( he did it like thirty times ! )  
and there are no interesting sites in l  a  that we see get destroyed  
part of the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever  
in "" independence day , "" the best part ( other than judd hirsch ) was watching the white house and empire state building get blown up by the aliens  
that was cool  
watching really fake-looking magma plow down the street is not  
okay , so the film's not devoid of merit  
as i already stated , don cheadle was great and the cast does their best  
and there's this really moronic scene which looks cool  
john carrol lynch ( norm from "" fargo "" ) goes on a subway car to save people but the lava comes and surrounds it  
he has one guy who's wounded and could make it  
he could throw the guy and jump and still survive  
but no ! ! ! 
he has to go and inanely jump and land right in the middle of the lava  
here's the cool sight : he melts  
here's the dumb part of it : he somehow manages to throw the man to safety as his legs are melting  
cool sight  
no logic  
but cool sight  
the volcano erupts twice and for some reason , the film ends there  
they aren't worried about it eruting again , they just go home to their toppled homes  
but to tell the truth , i was glad they didn't go on  
i was hoping the film was over after the first eruption ended "

-1,"i'm not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing "" disturbing behavior "" with "" scream  "" 
maybe it's because they're both horror films ( kinda ) , both have hot young stars , both have an annoying alternative soundtrack , and both are aimed at the teenage crowd , which i guess includes me  
but this is not the next in line with the "" scream "" flicks as well as the "" i know what you did last summer "" soon to be flicks  
it owes less to "" halloween "" and more to kafka and orwell , which , in my book , makes for a more interesting feature  
and it should have been  
this is basically a rehash of "" the stepford wives , "" the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross and dealing , as i've been told , with a bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives  
or something like that  
 "" behavior , "" starring katie holmes of "" dawson's creek , "" deals with a bunch of teenagers , deep in angst , who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers  
suck-ups  
preppies  
it actually , at least to me , sounds like it would work , and with scott rosenberg , that witty penmen who has written stuff like "" beautiful girls "" and "" things to do in denver when you're dead "" ( as well as "" con air "" ) , it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit  
alas , it's not , and it plumets into that little group of movies known as "" the movies with potential that blow it  "" 
i remember a film called "" white man's burden "" which dealt with a reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with it's potentially brilliant premise  
here's another one  
it could be a brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves  
it's a stage , and this film does in fact realize that  
it gets its message across and it does it effortlessly  
now it just needs to work as a film  
which it doesn't  
it's too sloppy and too contrived  
it paints a bleak portrait of high school life    then 
lets it lie  
it brings us a bunch of scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kiss-ups who do food drives and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes    then 
gives it a cheap twist : when they get horny , they become homicidal  
isn't it scary enough that they're like this , and can't the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them - not that you could be next to die ? 
the film introduces us two three different characters who , in the beginning , are considered outsiders because they're not ( yet ) part of this clique : the new kid , steve ( james marsden - dull dull dull dull ) , who's having trouble at home because he hasn't gotten over his brother's ( ethan embry , in quick flashes so you don't recognize him - i did ) suicide ; the renegade girl , rachel ( katie holmes , from "" dawson's creek "" ) , who's chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring ; and by far the most interesting kid , gavin ( nick stahl , the kid from "" the man without a face "" ) , who's the most interesting because he's the only character who's given some dimension  
in the film's best scene , he introduces steve to every single clique , nailing each one's fetishes and hang-ups , and it's the best scene in the movie because it's witty , satirical , and interesting - something the rest of this film isn't  
gavin suspects there's something awry with the preppie kids , known as the blue ribbons , and in the tradition of all conspirators , and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve , he's only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff  
here , we have another case of "" the idiot plot , "" where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him , but he may have saved this film from being the dreary , dull film that it is without gavin , who gives it life and humor  
the only other half-interesting character is the school janitor , played by william sadler as a retarded , scary guy who may not be what he seems to be    but 
really , we don't care anyway  
i probably shouldn't mention that this was directed by david nutter , who's works for "" the x-files , "" because that would probably tarnish his reputation  
like the show , he's good at setting up weird conspiracies , and creating a general creepy feel  
most of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect , and some of it works  
but what this film is not so good at is coming out with a good payoff  
he keeps too much inside , so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution in the third act , you wonder why they just don't get the hell out of there  
i think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there's something rotten in the state of teen angstdom  
what this film needs to be is a lot longer , a lot more colorful , and a lot creepier "

-1,"a friend invites you to a movie  
this film would evade the explosions and special effects of standard summer fare , and be grounded in reality  
the plot is as follows : after a terrifying incident , a mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move away from the city  
they need fresh air to get some perspective , maybe to start over  
romance begins to brew , however , as one of the locals , played by an international superstar in rugged clothing , sparks things up , ( especially at a country-western slow dance )  
it stars a rising young starlet , helms a good cast , and is directed by one of the better actor-turned-directors in hollywood  
you accept  
you jump at the opportunity to see , what you believe to be , _the horse whisperer_  
but , poor moviegoer , you have been conned  
alas , you find yourself watching , incredulously , _hope floats_  
oh , woe  
your hope has sunk  
why was this movie made ? 
why was it released ? 
it is a travesty on nearly every level , and has the authority to sink the careers of nearly everyone involved  
at the hands of a better script , the film could have been a gem  
but it is clueless as to what it is about , and only succeeds in transferring same cluelessness to us poor viewers  
_hope floats_ stars sandra bullock as birdy , who , after discovering her husband has been cheating on her with her best friend ( on national television no less ) , takes her daughter and drives back to her home , helmed by a countryish bumpkin eccentric played by gena rowlands , ( she decorates with stuffed wildlife )  
birdy's nephew , travis ( played by _leave it to beaver_'s cameron finley ) , is under her custody , and in one of the film's many failed in-jokes , is always seen wearing a different halloween costume  
what is the point of this ? 
does it make any sense ? 
is it supposed to be funny ? 
the point of the film is to show that the family is eccentric , but i was convinced that the grandma should have been locked up for endangering the mental welfare of a child  
all of this undercuts the plot , of which there is none  
there are only many scenes that are supposed to register emotion  
there's the scene where birdy , who used to be the prom queen , is humbled by approaching a peer she once mocked , for a job  
there's the scene where birdy dances with her father , in the hospital for alzheimer's  
and then there's the sentimental scenes with justin , played by harry connick jr  , who is taking a liking to her again , showing her a beautiful pad that he built from scratch  
and during each of these scenes , i was sidetracked by my earlier question  
what sort of eccentric grandmother go through such great pains as to provide a dog costume , a kermit costume , a cowboy costume ( with whip ) , and a full furred barney costume for her grandson to wear during dinner ? 
what sort of warped ramifications would this lead for the rest of his life ? 
outside of this , there are other sure signs of screenwriters block  
when the daughter stands up to the bully at school  
when birdy almost loses her job  
when the family pulls in a goofy lip-synch to cheer someone up  
when someone dies  
when the daughter cries , ( no , wails ) in exasperation that her father is not coming back  
in a movie like this , you notice the strings being pushed , and you sit there , comatose , hoping it will end  
who can survive such a debacle ? 
i worry for bullock's career , which has been running on auto-pilot for the last few years  
she has an attitude , a solid perkiness , and can drive a bus--but she can't handle the emotional scenes , much less hold a southern accent  
harry connick , jr  is worse--stick with singing , or get some acting lessons , please ! 
gena rowlands is the best part of the film  
but she's such a good actress , that it staggers the mind that she's weighed down by such lukewarm material here  
it would be a severe tragedy if the recurring star of john cassavettes' great films is known for this film  
two notes to forest whittaker : ( 1 ) cut the slow-motion sequences  
there are twelve times where you undercut your own direction by such a failed trick  
have you done so , you could have shaved off ten-minutes of this almost unbearable debacle  
 ( 2 ) you've had to know something was wrong if your cinematographer's filter makes the candlelight appear like little "" x "" s  
you're not a bad director , but you can't change a terrible script "

they set up mr  freeze as a tragic figure trying to cure his cryogenically frozen wife , then completely sabotage his character by giving him the lamest one-liners  
it turns him into a stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of a brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death  
but that's par for course -- nothing in this film makes any sense , including half of arnold schwarzenegger's lines  
as mr  freeze , arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once  
this is the same problem he had in "" jingle all the way "" , and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as the days pass  
personally , i think that he has more pull with the directors and doesn't retake scenes to make him understandable  
compare his dialogue in the terminator series to the load of nonsense that streams forth in "" batman & robin ""  
apparently , james cameron knows how to get a competent performance out of arnold  
uma thurman is not as bad , but nothing resembling good either  
her poison ivy vamps around terribly , chewing up scenery left and right  
and her pamela isley scenes are marred by sub-snl standard "" acting "" , as if she's reading off cue cards and is about to laugh at any given moment  
given the "" script "" , it's a wonder it didn't happen more frequently  
there is no redeeming feature in this film -- not george clooney as batman , chris o'donnell as robin , nor alicia silverstone as batgirl  
michael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred , as if the conceit of his illness was prompted by his cadaverous appearance  
in fact , there was something unsettling about his appearance , which seems to have been accomplished without any make-up tricks , looking as if it were scenes from a documentary about a dying man  
unfortunately , every scene about alfred's sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance -- they just go through the motions , losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart  
the movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of a big battle -- you know there's a bunch of people , but instead of a melee , schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a fist  
there's never a moment of awe , wonder , or mayhem  
the only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects , which are impressive ( and probably expensive )  
even then , the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that they become unwatchable  
the hockey team from hell ? 
not even the tv series got that stupid ( at least not on the grand scale of stupidity that "" batman & robin "" showcases )  
frustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off with nothing to say or do  
blink , and you'll miss elle macpherson as julie madison , vivica fox as a "" why is she even in the film "" vamp in freeze's lair ( with all of two lines ) , and pat hingle as the most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had  
and in what almost seems like an effort to save on costs , vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs  fries -- she isn't even filmed well enough to look good ( trust me , she's quite attractive outside of this dreck )  
and as if the film weren't bad enough to limp along with bad direction , bad dialogue , bad performances , and bad fight scenes , there are inconsistencies and illogic galore  
i know it's nit-picky to ask where the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs , why the character's arms aren't ripped out of their sockets when they accomplish a one-armed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet ( while holding on to another person no less ) , or where the moisture comes from when freeze's weapon creates tons if ice  
that's all traditional comic book stuff  
but why does batman spring a trap for freeze at a public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of by-standers ? 
why is there a big switch clearly marked , "" heat "" in mr  freeze's lair ? 
why do countless bumbling police officers even try to take on mr  freeze hand to hand ? 
why does alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl and even go so far as to have a suit made for her ? 
why do batman & robin take 10 minutes to bicker before leaving the batcave in response to an emergency ? 
and since it established early on that ivy is using pheromones , why don't they wear masks to filter it out ? 
i could go on and on  
 "" batman & robin "" is a braindead , pointless , garish , loud film that should still reign as the "" worst film of the year "" by the time 1998 rolls along

-1,"hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell  
the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films  
in a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous  
with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong's best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u  s  productions  
such talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results  
now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai  
unfortunately "" romeo must die "" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong's rhythms  
the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking  
enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong )  
kai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai's boss and leader of the local chinese family  
a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down  
it's not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends  
the following morning po sing is found dead  
suspicions escalate , as issac o'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder  
his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture  
issac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter  
the scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder  
he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined  
hung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work  
escaping to the u  s  han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother's death  
 "" romeo must die "" is in many ways a fun film  
it is both absurd and assured  
the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes "" the godfather ""  
the relationship between jet li's han and aaliyah's trish o'day reminds us of abel ferrera's "" china girl "" , except that romeo must die's couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another  
their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history  
the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable  
li , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination  
allayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace  
it's obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic  
but , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it  
delro lindo as issac o'day carries himself well in the film  
an unsung and under appreciated actor , mr  lindo turns out the films best performance  
the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d  b  woodside as issac's son , colin  
the performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in  
an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written  
first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film "
-1,"a hotshot lawyer gets an obviously guilty child molester acquitted , and shortly after during the victory celebration gets offered an opportunity to show his prowess in new york city  
the lawyer , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is not offered a job yet , he is asked to simply pick a jury  
he accepts  
the jury he selects work out well and before long he is offered a job with the firm  
making his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money , but a gorgeous apartment  
he convinces his wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) to make the move to new york  
the first case given to him is a big test ; a "" winless "" case concerning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement  
the charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal  
his new boss and partner in the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing , explaining many of his philosophies on law , women and sex , and angles the promise of a blissful , wealthy life  
kevin's next case is a dream case , given to him by milton himself ( much to the chagrin to his colleagues ) , defending a triple murder suspect who has had a history of problems with the law  
although kevin's career is taking off , his home life is not doing very well  
mary ann is starting to have numerous problems  
she is experiencing severe depression over kevin's long hours , and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls , their faces becoming horribly disfigured  
kevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife  
he does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with , then focus all of his attention on his wife  
not helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer ( connie nielson ) also working with the firm  
mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home  
kevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife , and gets disturbing news from his mother ( judith ivey ) about the mystery concerning the identity of his father  
he also starts to lose control of his case  
kevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man  
that man is his boss , mr  milton , a truly evil character who just may be the devil himself  
kevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store  
but how do you defeat the devil ? 
why is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd ? 
do filmmakers really believe that "" normal "" courtroom drama doesn't fit the bill and they have to juice them up ? 
the courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in a real courtroom , which wouldn't have been too bad if it weren't keanu reeves trying to pull it off  
i give reeves credit for trying hard , but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character , just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short  
charlize theron defines the term "" over-the-top "" in her performance as mary ann lomax , a disappointment in contrast to her good performance in "" 2 days in the valley ""  
the only good performance in the movie is by al pacino , but i kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess ? 
maybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil , and you can tell he is having fun doing so , but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him  
it's pretty standard stuff , including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom  
please read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled , but i have to get something off of my chest  
in 1986 i remember watching a movie called "" wisdom "" with emilio estevez and demi moore , and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do  
what i like to call "" guess what , it was all a dream "" scenario  
in "" wisdom "" the two lead characters are killed at the end , only to have one of the characters "" wake up "" from an apparent and say "" gosh , i'm glad that didn't really happen ! ""  
i considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with  
well , the same thing happens in "" the devils advocate "" , and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream ( perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan , since it failed and he is the devil ) , but the point is that the last 90% of the film didn't happen  
i know it's a stretch , after all it is a movie and nothing really happened , but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that  
of course , the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one  
as i recall , "" wisdom "" was a decent film  
 "" the devil's advocate "" is not  
the devils advocate

-1,"best remembered for his understated performance as dr  hannibal lecter in michael mann's forensics thriller , manhunter , scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on  
usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he's only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do  
if you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach's hidden agenda  
cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l  i  e  , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge  
big john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad  
what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light  
he's an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids' problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives  ) 
he'll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world  
l  i  e  stands for long island expressway , which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia  
filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano )  
in his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l  i  e  
highway deaths of filmmaker alan j  pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52  
he's both fascinated and disturbed by the l  i  e  , and those feelings are projected onto big john ( who follows howie around in his bright red car , but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn't want to do  
this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he's a beast , but ashamed of it  ) 
l  i  e  would have worked best as a half-hour short film about howie's ill-advised foray into big john's haven  
there is unnecessary padding with howie's miserable dad ( bruce altman ) in the hot seat for a white-collar crime , degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle-class houses , and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise-ass gary terrio ( billy kay ) , a handsome artful dodger  
rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) , these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length  
concurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted  
cox , sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo , is all bluff and bluster  
dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent  
we're so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious ( calling haley joel ! ) , it's surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene  
the restraint is admirable  
but l  i  e  's screenplay doesn't always give them the best material  
when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious "

nobody can save this bomb from it's own stupidity and arrogance in filmmaking and arrogance in believing that this is a positive religious-type of film  
it's just a pile of dreck    an 
ill-conceived exploitive project , a pyrotechnical film  
 "" end of days "" aims to be an apocalyptic thriller  
it features an idiotic script , a hack director , and a one-dimensional star who is past his prime    which 
makes this film dumber than dumb , plus it's not funny , not campy , or is it in the least bit entertaining  
it's just dreary and unwatchable    a 
big-budget slasher film  
arnold plays an alcoholic security guard who finds his new mission in life is to stop satan ( occupying gabriel byrne's body and possessing a wall st  bank account ) from destroying the world  
the film opens in vatican city , roma 1979 -- where the pope is alerted by a young visionary priest tomaso , looking out at the night sky and seeing a comet whiz by , who proclaims after looking at his scrolls -- that's the sign for the 'eye of god , ' which reveals that a child has been born who is being prepared to give birth to satan's baby ( the anti-christ ) in the hour before the new century begins , when satan will fuck her and open up the gates to hell on earth  
tomaso has some twenty years to find this woman and save her and the world from doom  
but some in the pope's circle want to kill her if found , even though the pope insists on having faith and letting her live , as he lectures them : "" even in the world's darkest days -- doing evil doesn't stop evil , but brings on more evil  "" 
we saw the girl being born in nyc in 1979 , which seems to be the 'logical' place to look for satan according to the astrology charts of the visionaries  
the chosen woman is christine york ( robin )  
it is now a few days before the new year celebration for 2000 and arnold and his wise-cracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired to guard a wall street turd , and when he is fired upon by a renograde priest , thomas aquinas , arnold saves him and through a ridiculous chase captures the tongue less priest who fired the shot  
he , nevertheless , can speak and tells arnold an 'end of days' is coming as prophesized in revelations  
but satan gets to him in his hospital room and nails him to the ceiling while scribbling latin warnings of 'the end of the world' on his body  
it is now up to arnold to save the world and find the chosen woman  
he quickly finds christine and does everything to protect her from all the evil forces around her , as the film includes ludicrous helicopter rescues , people jumping out of windows , satan taking a piss and dropping a match to kill arnold's partner as the piss explodes like gasoline , satan being fired at    resulting in his sometimes experiencing pain and sometimes nothing , as if the director forgot which way he wants to have it  
there is nothing spared in nyc from fire bombs -- including the subway , churches , and luxury buildings  
the only trouble with all these high-budget action sequences , was that it lacked purpose and even entertainment value  
the story was so terrible and inaccurate , that it did not have an iota of value or credibility  
mercifully the movie drags to a final confrontation in times square , trying unsuccessfully to build tension to the countdown toward the year 2000  
why is the end of 1999 considered to be the devil's number "" 666 , '' well ! 
    
satan's numeral is actually "" 999 , '' which is upside down of "" 666  '' 
accordingly , you just put a "" 1'' in front of it-- and bingo -- you get "" 1999  '' 
with logic like that , this film might even think it pulled the wool over the viewer's eyes and got away with such a febrile explanation of the occult "
-1,"as any reasonable human being would , i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certain things  
i am befuddled by fight club  
now sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success until much later , sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later  
perhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their time  
perhaps it is because they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them to sink in do we truly appreciate and understand them  
fight club is either garbage or brilliant , but , at least right now , i must lean toward the former  
maybe i am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowly leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure gold  
but if it is , i sure don ? t see it  
edward norton plays jack , a field examiner for a major automobile manufacturer  
his insomnia , coupled with his compulsive desires to fill his world with ikea furniture to ? complete ? himself , make him a loser at the game of life  
but when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his 15th story window , he seeks comfort in a stranger , tyler ( pitt ) whom he met on a flight home  
once jack is sucked into tyler ? s world , he can ? t get out , literally  
they begin fight club , an organization based on brutal and bloody fistfights that signify nothing other than to provide those that join a sense of belonging  
as the fight club grows , things get out of control and take on cult status , beginning with one future soldier who proves his worth by standing still outside tyler ? s house for three days  
i dare not even begin to bring up the last quarter of the film , since that contains the twist that ? explains ? the pointless journey  
suffice it to say i was truly disappointed in fincher , who ? s previous two films , se7en and the game put him in a very slim category of truly brilliant young filmmakers of the next generation  
this is not to imply by any means that he is no longer a genius or capable of bringing more masterpieces to the table  
but with fight club , he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments and self-referencing film elements , such as talking to the audience about what they are seeing , telling them that the little blips in the right hand corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels and that a slightly altered recurring line is good ? flashback humor ?  
now , throughout the film ? s coarsely woven texture and over-extended plot lines , fight club is obviously trying to make various social comments about the state of the world today  
advertisements , inter-office politics , corporations , you name it , it ? s addressed  
 ( though the media are suspiciously absent from the institutions that are referenced  ) 
all of them play an important role  
how so ? 
well , i can kinda just tell  
i can ? t really put my finger on it  
to say that starbucks and barnes & noble are taking over their respective markets and kicking out the small business owner is no big news  
is that bad for the world ? 
probably  
not much room for social commentary there  
we all know that inter-office politics are just that    politics  
so what was the point of all this ? 
the film seems desperate to make a point , or a number of points , but i couldn ? t figure out what they were  
all i saw was a very bizarre social satire that was woven with strange film techniques , a bleak visual design and some fine acting  
 ( pitt , carter , norton    all of them are good  
even meatloaf is good  ) 
when you get to the end , you will most likely be filled with questions , many of which the filmmakers wanted you to ask of yourself  
not them , because each of them would likely give you a different answer  
fight club means what you want it to mean , i think fincher just gives you the stuff to think about  
but it couldn ? t be more bizarre and unappealing  
sure , it had shock value , but so did se7en and the game , and they were significantly stronger films "

--- a rapist ( matt frewer ) responds to supergirl's ( helen slater ) query as to why she's being attacked , an example of the mind-numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl  
i'll admit it    
i love superman iii  
i know it's hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor , but i still think it's a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise  
supergirl , a spin-off film of sorts from the series' same producers ( alexander and ilya salkind ) , doesn't even rival superman iii in terms of quality , let alone superman or superman ii  
supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time  
as the film begins we see the residents of argo city , a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in "" inner space "" , go about their daily lives  
ok    
what ? 
so these are exiles from krypton , which blew up right ? 
were they living there before krypton exploded ? 
how do you get to "" inner space "" ? 
this whole "" inner space "" notion is never explained , particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world  
how do they know where superman went ? 
how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ? 
these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me  
argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron  
one day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o' toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman's cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art  
kara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of "" whatever "" that protects the city  
in the chaos , the omegahedron sails out through the opening , dooming the argonians to death    
in three days time , or something  
kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world  
the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who , immediately before her dip was ruined , announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook )  
selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination  
selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she's arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume )  
supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives  
ok    
huh ? 
why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ? 
attention movie : explain yourself ! 
i'm sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much  
i can't buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to

bad  
that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls  
if that summary isn't enough for you , how about t&a , t&a , t&a ? 
still haven't got the point ? 
other than director russ meyer's predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore-mentioned anatomical areas , there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie  
that is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay  
after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face  
this movie stinks out loud  
quite frankly , this movie deserves a  
but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny  
so i'm giving it a  
and maybe that is too generous  
right from the opening credits , i knew that i had a class-a bomb on my hands  
not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting , but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform  
i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene  
to be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film  
with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it wouldn't have surprised me if the opening had never been explained  
so what is this movie about ? 
you ask  
like it really matters  
ok , here goes  
this all-girl band headed by kelly macnamara ( dolly reed ) and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry  
once there , they do manage to find success ( due as much to their hooters as anything else ? it sure wasn't for their brutally bad singing voices ) , and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them  
everything from big egos , to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral  
there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure , but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing  
>from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here  
other than the above-mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have  
the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts  
mr  ebert has generously thrown in helpings of "" hey man "" , "" dig "" and my all time favorite -- "" this is my happening , and it freaks me out ""  
now i ask you , with lines like that how can you go wrong ? 
ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue  
maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter  
i don't know , but all the big words in the world wouldn't be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting  
but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie  
i've seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey  
in fact , there is one scene -- the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes -- during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries  
add to the directing and writing the music in this movie  
i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken , there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers  
then we have the cast  
first lets start david gurian who played harris , the manager of the band

-1,"one would think that david duchovny , star of the cult favorite "" x-files "" would be very careful in choosing his leading man cinema roles  
at least one would hope so  
one would be seriously incorrect  
eugene sands ( duchovny ) is a surgeon so dedicated to his craft that he becomes addicted to amphetamines to stay awake and work more  
it turns out to be a bad plan when he loses a patient and his license while under the influence  
ten months later , in a seedy bar to score synthetic heroin , the doctor gets a chance to ply his trade when assassins gun down a customer  
using a plastic water bottle and bar tubing , sands operates and saves his life  
smalltime hoodlum raymond blossom ( timothy hutton ) is impressed with the cutlery skills on his associate  
he kidnaps and then offers down-and-out eugene a position in his organization  
blossom needs a doctor to patch up gunshot victims that would be problematic at a hospital  
sand's temptation is that this will give him a chance to practice medicine again albeit illegally , big chunks of cash to fuel his habit and close proximity to the gangster's womanfriend claire ( angelina jolie ) , this film's babe factor  
the would-be big time operator is desperately in need of help  
on the run from russian mobsters ( the bad guys that seem to be all the rage in this year's films ) and trying to cut a pirate software deal with the chinese mafia , blossom is surrounded by blood  
after a few medical misadventures , the physician grows disenchanted with his employment  
an encounter with a couple of psycho surfer dudes who threaten to blow him away unless he "" fixes "" their dead buddy cements his feeling that he is in the wrong line of work  
when the fbi visits and forces him to become an informant , there is no question that he needs to be somewhere else  
oddly enough , these seem like they could be exciting scenes  
the film disproves that assumption  
then a bunch of other uninteresting things happen  
writing this only two days after seeing the film , its a struggle to remember the events  
you can take that as a solid lack of recommendation  
for all the coolness that duchovny exhibits in "" x-files "" , it's a surprise that his big screen presence is so lacking in charisma  
the doctor is particularly bland and dull  
even the cold turkey bit which is rife with dramatic possibilities come across as banal  
a little chocolate and minor sweats get him through heroin withdrawal  
like virtually everything else in the film , it's a missed opportunity  
the fox mulder detachment doesn't work here  
oscar-winner hutton's manic mobster is much more difficult to get a handle on  
played partially for comedy and partially as crazed killer , blossom almost becomes real , but then sinks into goofiness  
most of the time hutton looks as if he's searching for his character and coming up empty  
jolie also makes a few false moves towards creating a three-dimensional human being before giving up and turning into scenery  
the most interesting aspect of her performance is watching her pouty lips threaten to take over the screen  
the rest aren't any better  
michael massee's eccentric fbi agent never revs up  
one of blossom's henchmen steals a few moments of the show as a quirky gunman reminiscent of val kilmer's doc holliday in "" tombstone ""  
his two-gunned blasting as he does a bizarre dance is the high point of the film  
but that 15 seconds isn't worth sitting through the other 90 minutes  
first time film director andy wilson ( known for his work on the british television series "" cracker "" ) appears to be attempting to jump on the "" pulp fiction "" bandwagon  
the best of these movies combine a sense of style and flash with significant substance  
the second-rate ones concentrate on just one of these aspects  
 "" playing god "" does neither well  
the basic idea of the film is solid  
and then it goes nowhere "
-1,
-1,"the previews for the movie are pretty good  
they show a little plot , all the characters , and the emotional highlights , all spliced together to give a general impression of the script  
unfortunately , the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes  
the residents of mystery love hockey  
mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football  
the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player who's guilty of shooting another man ( yes , that's one of the movie's jokes  ) 
every saturday , the best players pair off for a game , and the whole town comes to watch  
the town's prodigal son charlie ( hank azaria ) wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated  
mystery's national fame has the town abuzz  
a week later , charlie actually shows up in person , and he brings with him an offer from the nhl  
the new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals  
the mysterians see this as both good and bad  
on the one hand , they'd love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition  
on the other hand , they don't want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes  
the movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition  
biebe ( russell crowe ) has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys , including his new replacement  
he's already resentful , and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife  
crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film , so he's just kind of stuck with constantly brooding  
charlie , meanwhile , is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a man's worth  
his "" gift "" of the feature story , and of the new york rangers , was his way of compensating for not being a better skater  
he hoped it would earn him some respect and merit , but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him  
burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter , the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans  
walter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey , but he actively tries to put it behind him  
he wants his son to take the game more seriously , but he wants his community to just get over it  
reynolds could have been good , but sloppy writing and/or editing keep walter in the corner , and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together  
one character actually was interesting  
biebe's wife ( mary mccormack ) , like the judge , understood that there was more to life than hockey  
but unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community  
she chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open  
her unique insight is verbalized once , and it lasts only a scene before it is gone , but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom  
mysterty , alaska follows a handful of other characters , but none are well developed or worth mentioning  
the biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story , no underlying thing that the movie is really about  
instead , roach and screenwriters david e  kelley and sean o'byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy  
they try to make you laugh and cry , to feel outrage and pride  
they present the framing and cadence for jokes , but there's nothing truly funny  
they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness , but they give you nothing to be really sad about  
as columnist molly ivins would say , it's all hat , no cattle  
the perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about  
there is a funeral scene , played with appropriate gravity and somber music  
it is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide what's truly important  
russell crowe steps forward to speak , about to spell out the movie's metaphor for us  
he says that what really matters in life is "" community "

but what did you expect when you clicked on this title ? 
 * * * 
cast : kristen holly smith , danica sheridan , alex boling , michael dotson , sonya hensley , janet krajeski , sabrina lu , dionysius burbano , calvin grant , jeff b  harmon written and directed by : jeff b  harmon running time : 97 minutes 
 "" the thought of losing you makes me all vomity inside  "" 
--- blatz balinski ( danica sheridan ) laments the fact that her lesbian lover , april ( kristen holly smith ) , has just received a telegram from her ex-fiance  
isle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot ( smith ) , a resident of the small town of bumfuck , arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson ( michael dotson )  
when april gets extreme cold feet she runs home , sticks a gun in her mouth , and pulls the trigger  
instead of killing herself , she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos , an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed ( except for lance , the homosexual toilet cleaner/slave )  
april loves her new home and friends , but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up  
mr  and ms  pfferpot ( director jeff b  harmon and janet krajeski ) decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr  sigmoid colon ( also jeff b  harmon ) , who claims he can cure homosexuality  
in actuality , dr  colon is homosexual as well and begins his special "" treatment "" on dick dickson ( unbeknownst to dick )  
when april turns down dick's demand for her to return to bumfuck , he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambo-style  
instead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance ( alex boling ) and the two of them , along with april and her lover blatz , get married  
 ( note to the filmmaker : why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i'm assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided ? ) 
april's parents , feeling like there is no recourse , call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer ) their way  
the bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the "" circuitry "" and they re-wire it and send it back to washington d  c  , destroying it  
mr  and ms  pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own  
i'm not sure if writer/director/co-star jeff b  harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs  
either way , he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie  
the film opens with a preacher running a small african-american child out of town , and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan ( during a jaunty musical number ) , preceded by remarks about "" gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others , such as the jews ""  
if harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be , then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film , but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can't help but feel like he had some serious intent  
as for the entire central theme of the movie , i'm afraid that it's one that i just don't get  
i tried to keep an open mind while watching it , but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes  
it was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society  
how does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non-acceptance ? 
i'm not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society , but don't force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren't going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me  
again , maybe i'm missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make , but if so , i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully  
as far as musical comedies go , isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical , but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy  
despite the disturbing visuals , "" mom and apple pie "" stuck with me for the rest of the day  
speaking of disturbing visuals , "" wedding bells ain't ringing "" could have been a decent song , but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying  
 "" i'm a lesbian "" ( which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular ) is also pretty good , but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms  smith "
-1,"battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000 , and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close  
in fact , i'll be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years  
based on the novel by scientology guru l  ron hubbard , battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information  
it's the year 3000 , and an alien race called the psychlos ( which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers ) conquered our planet in nine minutes  
ok , we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind  
when were we conquered ? 
the audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 , 000 years earlier , and if that is the case then we're going to get into a whole bunch of problems later ( trust me    
keep reading )  
also , why don't we get to see earth get conquered ? 
how the hell do you make a popcorn sci-fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film ? 
humans now live as cavemen or slave labor , and for the film's first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver , colorado  
they grunt and groan and babble about monsters  
so , when the psychlos conquered earth , were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills ? 
none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered ( whenever that was )  
this is definitely not the way to start an action/sci-fi film  
one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster , and he begins to fight it  
the "" monster "" turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course  
he turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course , with some shrubs growing over them  
so , in 1 , 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time , with only a few weeds growing over it ? 
anyway , some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl ( john travolta ) a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit  
the cavemen ( led by barry pepper ) are forced to do their bidding or whatever , but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet , or something  
so these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1 , 000 years earlier ? 
and , we're supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who can't even handle a few cavemen ? 
one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos  
so jets left unattended for 1 , 000 years are still able to fly ? 
please , if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood  
why did the psychlos leave jets around anyway ? 
shouldn't they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us ? 
the psychlos refer to humans as "" man animals "" but yet dogs are still "" dogs ""  
why aren't they "" dog animals "" ? 
the psychlos are after mining earth's precious resources , but for 1 , 000 years are unaware of fort knox ? 
why do i even care at this point ? 
i'm a fan of travolta's and i'm glad to see he's back on the a-list in hollywood ( despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon )  
but how did he possibly think this was a good movie ? 
and how did he think he was giving a good performance here ? 
he's more than capable of making a menacing villain ( see broken arrow and face/off ) but whenever his character came on screen i couldn't hold back my laughter  
now despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have , travolta just looks like travolta  
all of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face , but travolta just has a goatee  
also , travolta's acts with a sort of phony upper-class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world  
ooooo , scary villain  
as a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better  
you can make a dumb but good sci-fi film ( i love independence day for example ) , but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth  
i did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening    
i cleaned my glasses , walked around the theater , made a grocery list , chose my lottery numbers for the week , replayed super bowl xxv in my head ( with commercials )    
and still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids  
by the time we actually reach the year 3000 , people should still be avoiding this film  
folks , save your cash   
don't go see it , don't rent it , and don't buy it  
you'd be more entertained by taking the money you'd use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind , watching it sail away ( hell , send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal  "

-1,"in the continuation of warner brother's franchise , joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow  
what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film  
avika goldsman's screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another  
this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as "" the client "" is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke  
situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another  
this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone's batgirl , who just happens to be alfred's niece  
the story of dr  victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought  
while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife , dr  freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure , and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment  
now of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live  
now the logic of that little sub-plot escapes me  
if mr  freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death , why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth  
this is indeed a cold hearted man  
the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory  
she wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal  
she joins with mr  freeze in his plan to start a new ice age , destroying all animal life , therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them  
the characters have no logic  
batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films  
now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward / robin , bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure , constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships , while at the same time not really having any  
george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him  
to say that his performance is workman-like is to be generous  
his best performances are still on "" e  r  ""  
bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend ( played by elle macpherson ) , that it brings into question bruce's latent homosexuality  
there is no spark and no passion ( as there was for nicole kidman's psychologist in "" batman forever "" ) between bruce and anyone other than alfred  
and even that relationship is very reserved  
robin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series  
now he's just a spoiled kid  
in "" batman forever "" , burt ward wanted to be batman's partner and friend  
now , robin is suffering from ego deficiency  
robin's attraction for poison ivy is not believable , except for a boy around the age of 15  
his later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest , even though they are not related in a traditional sense  
chris o'donnell , once considered a rising star , successfully burns up on reentry with this performance  
his robin needs nothing more than a good spanking  
the less said about alicia silverstone's performance the better  
this talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film  
she was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it  
this brings us to the villains

-1,"the stereotypical american male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports cars  
producer jerry bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with a movie so loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars , sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze  
gone is 60 seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry  
cage is legendary retired car thief , memphis raines ( don't you love cute movie names ) , who must call upon his time worn skills to save his thick-headed brother ( ribisi ) from being killed  
seems a murderous crime boss ( eccleston ) with a fetish for wood ( insert your own joke ) hired brother kip to steal a ridiculous amount of expensive , exotic autos  
fifty cars , to be exact  
poor kip screws the pooch and bungles the job badly  
if the cars aren't delivered in three days , bossman has a casket carved out just for kip  
literally  
if only someone could save him  
hmmmm   wonder 
what memphis is doing ? 
in order to give the film some emotional heft , there are several subplots designed to tug at our heartstrings or give us the thrill of    yawn , excuse me , dramatic tension  
shadowing memphis is an old law enforcement foe ( lindo ) who's looking to send memphis away  
will he catch him ? 
there's old flame sway ( jolie ) , who had her heart broken by memphis years ago  
will they get back together ? 
shortsighted , thrill seeker kip idolizes his brother , yet resents him for moving away from the family  
will they reconnect ? 
raines old mentor ( duvall ) has long since left the life of crime  
will memphis get him finally caught as he pulls him back into the life , one more time ? 
can you answer all these questions correctly in 2 seconds without seeing the film first ? 
i'll bet you can  
following the opening credits , which fill you in on the accomplishments of the raines family through a montage of old photos , we was taken full throttle into the splendor that is memphis  
he's first shown living the good life teaching young children to drive go-carts  
in a later scene , as misfit brother kip knowingly tells memphis he has the stolen car situation under control , all the while making breakfast , a metaphor is made of shakespearean proportions  
just as a pan of grease flares up with kip clueless to how to quell it , big brother memphis calmly and efficiently throws some salt on it  
looks like everything might turn out alright after all  
you know this because the music swells on the crest of violins  
that's about as strong as the characterization gets , which is a shame  
bruckheimer has a real talent for loading his movies with an obscene amount of talent given the task at hand  
monumentally underused jolie portrays an empty headed sexpot whose idea of sex revolves around cars and memphis  
or maybe it's just the cars  
duvall trots out his ornery , but sweet old codger outfit  
i'm sure he's still laughing at taking a paycheck for this one  
lindo projects a warm hearted , but tightly focused detective that almost transcends the material  
the biggest waste of resources is vinnie jones , who plays a mute accomplice of memphis  
without saying a word , he is easily the most charismatic person in the movie  
like a blast of nitrous oxide , he attacks each scene with a straightforward zeal  
too bad his minutes onscreen are so few  
somehow , bruckheimer manages to attract top hollywood acting talent to high concept , poorly written movies , gussies up the film with lots of gold hues and pleasingly stylized action and they sell like proverbial hotcakes  
every time something clever happens it's counterbalanced by something so overtly wrong that it jerks you back into realizing you're watching a movie  
there's a innovative usage of black lighting that goes from being a novelty to a part of the plot  
it's counterbalanced by an extremely feeble attempt at humor by having an asian american repeatedly failing a driver's test  
imagine the yuks "

-1,"the tagline for this film is : "" some houses are just born bad ""  
so i didn't expect too much from this  
but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre  
i thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont  
i thought , mabe it will be fun ? 
and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing  
but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ?  
these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality  
here is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation  
among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor )  
actually , the doctor is researching the "" primordial fear reaction "" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch ! 
what happens  
but he gets unexpected help from the house itself  
it rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights  
portals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs  
a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth  
filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains  
but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen  
the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture  
is that exciting or what ? 
the worst thing about it is that it didn't have to be bad  
it's based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , '' by shirley jackson  
a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent  
it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience  
 "" the blair witch project "" , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses  
and with a $70 mill  
budget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror  
de ! 
bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening  
he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush  
but why give him a more serious material ? 
in the end "" haunting "" will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont's career as a director  
yet it wouldn't be fair to say that everything is bad  
the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky  
but this is where the good things end  
the music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is absolutely without life  
it's nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza ; visually impressive , but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn't engage  
at first you do not know what's going on  
is this part of the experiment ? 
are these hallucinations ? 
projections of the subconscience ? 
paranoia ? 
but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening  
the house is actually possessed  
it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window  
for ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that's what i got ? 
i believe hichock once said that "" it's ! 
better to wait for a climax , than to see one ""  
this may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only stupid  
they are impossible to take seriously  
any paralells that you might have heard before , linking this picture to kubrick's "" the shining "" , are absolutely baseless  
 "" shining "" had class , style , story , acting , but most of all talent and originality  
 "" haunting "" has only special effects and art direction to boast of  
and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film "

 "" please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie  "" 
-- chuck dowling , the jacksonville film journal 
i wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997's batman and robin  
apparently , no one heard my words  
oh , how i wish you had heard them  
oh how i wish someone had stopped him    
because he's done it again  
the plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore , a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale  
in fact , it was everything that 8mm is not  
in the opening minutes of 8mm , we see private detective tom welles ( nicolas cage ) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u  s  government  
keep this fact in mind , cage is trusted with an important case , which he solves  
he returns home to his wife and new daughter , and even finds time to rake his yard ( keep that in mind too , it's important as well )  
he's hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery  
after her husband's death she comes across a film in his private safe  
it appears to be snuff film , a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera  
the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film , hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film  
so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film  
the main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless  
welles is actually selected for the case by the old woman's lawyer ( anthony heald , an actor who always plays the same type of character , that being a bad guy )  
when you first see him , your first instinct is that he's behind the whole thing  
the choice of casting does the film in  
then , as welles begins his investigation , at times we will see a shadowy figure following him  
the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer ( or someone sent by the lawyer ) because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet  
so your first instinct has now been confirmed  
then , when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing , he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced ( in one of those ridiculous "" since we're going to kill you anyway , why not tell you the whole thing "" moments )  
but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he's told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended  
huh ? 
also , when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing , his main goal is to get the film back  
so why did he give it up in the first place ? ! 
the lawyer had the film the whole time , then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film ? ! 
it's totally absurd    
and this is the screenwriter of seven ? 
late in the film there's a confrontation between all the main characters , and after a struggle one of the character's guns ends up underneath a car  
cage , who has been handcuffed to a bed , is rapidly trying to get to his gun , which is on a table  
james gandolfini's character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of "" suspense ""  
you see , the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he's trying to reach it from , and so instead of going around the car to the other side ( where he can easily reach it ) he just keeps stretching  
go around to the other side of the car ! ! 
this goes on for minutes  
then , after cage gets his gun , gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car  
boy , schumacher is really really getting on my nerves  
i think the final straw would be when cage returns home , devastated by everything that he's seen on this case , and then is no longer able to rake his lawn ! 
we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard  
other things that bugged me about 8mm : one would be the music , if you can call it that  
whenever the score starts up , it sounds like techno music , and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it "

-1,"watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute 'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey  
if the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star  
alas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs  
what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars  
that's pretty generous , considering the movie's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek  
when will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it  
so why such a seemingly high rating ? 
there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage  
first , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater  
the sound and screen kicked ass  
nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way )  
also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie's tension  
i even liked the computer-generated settings  
i usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i've seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities  
also , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain  
william hurt isn't too bad either  
neither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable  
and perhaps i shouldn't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood  
there is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a "" real "" kiss -- no sex )  
it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six  
those movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven  
that type of moviemaking is a lost art  
now for the bad news  
worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue  
it's squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction  
 "" you better hold on to your joystick , "" is one such line  
and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign  
second worst , and closely related , is the screenplay  
the story's exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what's happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest  
once the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived  
when gary oldman easily reprograms will's pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : "" he flipped the switch to 'evil  ' "" 
then there's the tone of the movie  
the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson  
then it could be an adventure movie  
they're mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn't a good enough actor to carry it off  
still , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination  
just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn't mean that we have to bow to a "" promise keepers "" notion of who's the center of a family  
many quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect  
and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie  
in star wars , the rebels were the good guys  
we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system  
in lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free  
that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists  
finally , a few specific details deserve criticism "
-1,"reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way )  
the guy can't seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : "" rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel "" ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely )  
his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight  
i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , "" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! "" 
it's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie  
and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? 
auteur theory be damned ; it's kruger's "" style "" , not the director's that winds up on screen  
kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut "" sometimes less is more ""  
and his numerous twists can't even claim to be originals ; arlington rd's ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j  pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn't know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the "" character ""    grammar 
be damned )  
 "" how did you know that ? "" 
the stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along  
  
  
since twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger's screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it's no wonder why he works so frequently  
he's quickly becoming miramax's mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects  
this is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr  vehicles  
their company's current logo could be "" we ride the trends ""  
reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head  
although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick  
affleck is such a puppy dog that it's impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone's bitch  
the role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent "" serious "" movie getting  
it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who's played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) 
james frain is nick , rudy's cellmate , a manslaughterer who's found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron )  
ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she's never seen one picture of him  
which works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts  
he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino  
though by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i've described might as well be irrelevant  
this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner  
included : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less )  
though it's an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience  
the flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up  
it would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr  morneau 
 ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this  
he films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart  
problem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play  
character problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off  
the former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear  
but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster  
charlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next  
she never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this  
gary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat  
these are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience "

-1," "" mandingo "" has traditionally been seen as one of two things : either a much-needed revisionist look at slavery in the south , or in the words of film critic leonard maltin , "" a trashy potboiler "" that "" appeals only to the s&m crowd  "" 
actually , i think "" mandingo "" is a strange combination of the two , although it fails on both fronts  
it's too trashy to be good drama , but too dramatic to be good trash  
the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell ( james mason ) and his son , hammond ( perry king )  
one day in new orleans , hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede ( heavyweight boxer ken norton )  
although the movie never explains it , a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley  
according to the movie , mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves  
hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him  
hammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves  
meanwhile , hammond has married his cousin , blanche ( susan george ) , because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild  
hammond , however , is happier spending nights with his "" bed wench , "" the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex  
it is quickly apparent that hammond , despite his overt racism , is more in love with his bed wench , a sensitive slave girl named ellen ( brenda sykes ) , than he is with blanche  
hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had "" pleasured "" her before he did  
of course , it's fine that he's slept with numerous slave girls , but the fact that his wife , a "" white lady , "" had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her  
so blanche is usually left lonely and sex-starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen  
blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child  
hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half-black child ( although it's okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond ) , so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth , and hammond poisons blanche  
hammond then finds mede , shoots him twice in the shoulder , and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water  
yes , you read right : the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive  
judging only by the plot , "" mandingo "" is pure sexploitation  
the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible , with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society  
when "" mandingo "" was released in 1975 , it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail ; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs  
dramatically , "" mandingo "" is weak and unfocused , and historically it's mostly confused  
if one were to judge history by this film , it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality , not economics  
not once in the film do we see any of the slaves working , except for a few house servants  
the men spend most of the time sitting around , while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner  
there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves , but "" mandingo's "" overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick ( although there's plenty of violence -- fights , vicious beatings , shootings , and the aforementioned human boiling sequence -- thrown in for good measure )  
some tried to write off "" mandingo "" as a blaxploitation film , one of a number of quickly-made , low-budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies , but it's not that easy  
 "" mandingo "" was studio-financed by paramount pictures , and produced by dino de laurentiis , the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as "" the bible "" ( 1966 ) , the remake of "" king kong "" ( 1976 ) , and the ill-fated "" dune "" ( 1984 )  
the director was richard fleischer , a veteran who was best known for several special effects-laden action movies including "" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea "" ( 1954 ) and "" fantastic voyage "" ( 1966 ) , as well as such superior suspense films as "" the narrow margin "" ( 1952 )  
the script , based on the supermarket best-seller by ken ostott ( and the subsequent play by jack kirkland ) , was penned by norman wexler , who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on "" serpico  "" 
james mason , perry king , and susan george were well-known and respected actors ( mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt ) , and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career  
so why is "" mandingo "" so bad ? 
a number of reasons , including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job  
wexler's script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive ; it combines stereotyped slave-talk ( "" yessuh , massuh "" ) , stereotyped southern white trash talk ( "" fer whut're you gittin' outta bed ? "" ) , and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk ( "" if you see me hang , you gonna know you killed a black brother ! "" )  
fleischer's direction is clumsy , especially during the fight scenes , and all the actors give weak performances , especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable  
nevertheless , credit should be given where credit is due  
despite its exploitative nature , "" mandingo "" was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery  
until then , there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery  
even classics such as "" gone with the wind "" ( 1939 ) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter  
 "" mandingo "" reassessed the south , and showed that it wasn't all beautiful plantations , green fields , and pretty sunsets  
but all this is constantly undermined by the film's negligible point-of-view -- it claims to see things from the black perspective , but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners  
with a little more maturity and different handling , "" mandingo "" might have been an effective , worthwhile film  
while it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery , it never deals with them "

-1,"at one point in this movie there is a staging of an opera that goes completely wrong  
but one member of the crowd stands up and cheers , thinking the performance was planned , and applauding it for their efforts  
that's "" dirty work "" in a nutshell  
a very different kind of movie  
this is not a movie that i can easily review  
the critic in me analyzes the structure , plot , acting , characters  
  
  and 
tells me this movie is terrible  
but the norm macdonald fan in me had me rolling on the floor laughing  
this movie plays more like an hbo sketch comedy than a movie  
it's a one note concept  
mitch and sam need $50000 in order to bribe a doctor to give their father a heart transplant before other more needy patients  
realizing they are very good at revenge plots , they open a revenge for hire business , eventually running afoul of a rich businessman played by christopher macdonald ( who after roles in "" happy gilmore "" and "" veronica's closet "" seems typcast in this role ) , who sends them to destroy a building that mitch learns is the home of his girlfriend's grandmother , thus leading them to plot against the rich businessman on the night of the grand opening of a new opera house  
first the critic in me  
the plot is the standard poor guy vs evil rich guy device , where the main character meets the girl of his dreams along the way  
here's the catch  
none of the characters are sympathetic  
they're all selfish jerks who don't care who they hurt in their attempts to do whatever they want  
the jokes are juvenile , crude , appealing to the worst elements in people  
there's jokes about prostitutes , the homeless , beastiality , anal sex  
there's even a subplot that's developed , it seems , only to make jokes about infidelity and incest  
and i loved watching it  
i was a huge fan of norm macdonald's sarcastic , to-the-point comedy on saturday night live , and this movie is an hour and a half of it  
norm macdonald takes a joke , strips it to the core , and tells it like it is with a dry wit  
like the scene were he and his friend are learning the ropes at a new construction job  
the foreman goes over the basics , which mitch and sam don't understand  
how do they get out of it ? 
by admiting they lied on their resumes , and don't know a thing about construction ! 
and surprise , they get fired  
the characters are incredibly mean-spirited  
there's a father who's loud and obnoxious , a gambling addicted doctor played by chevy chase who tells sam of his father's condition by saying "" if i were a gambling man i'd put a lot of money on death  "" 
the businessman cole who always has his dog spunky , and does who knows what with it  
and then there's mitch and sam , who , thinking they can get $50000 by destroying a building , ponder how their actions would ruin the lives of the residents  
 "" too bad we have to do it , "" mitch says  
here's a movie where every joke that is executed as it is set up , where you see every punchline coming , where every spot profanity could be used and then is used  
at least the film is honest , and makes no mistake that it is anything more than idiotic  
but at least it isn't dull , and it isn't predictable  
and that's the way it should be  
it's sketch comedy , and if you're a fan of norm macdonald , you'll love it  
the jokes are crude , the characters are mean to the core , the attitude of the movie is that it just doesn't care  
if you don't like norm macdonald , or stupid movies , then you probably won't like this one  
the jokes are crude , the characters are mean to the core , the attitude of the movie is that it just doesn't care  
so before seeing this one , tune your mindset , and prepare for a slew of norm macdonald humor , gay animal sex , prison rape jokes , uncaring characters , and one last performance from chris farley  
the critic in me says ( * ) but i give it an 8 ( * * * ) "

-1,"in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black  
sir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner  
his oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake  
the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes  
hopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts  
whichever one you like , dear , he says  
and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries  
i liked that scene for two reasons  
first , the cakes looked really cool  
second , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act  
meet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot  
it's easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it's even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely )  
the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess  
i know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy  
case in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie  
however , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani  
 ( it's not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense  ) 
it shouldn't take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr  pitt  
and indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished  
well , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous  
so , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately  
anyway , the deceased lawyer's body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role  
the idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world  
if this weren't hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who's wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn't know how to act in our society  
it also doesn't help that the character of death is written so inconsistently  
he claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one )  
he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois  
he knows everything about some characters , nothing about others  
and as played by brad pitt , he's not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he's just there  
it's as if someone told pitt , "" never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty  "" 
it's as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie  
i've used the phrase "" angel of death "" in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt's performance with this year's best angel performance , nicolas cage's in city of angels  
where pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows  
where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant  
cage struck instant chemical sparks with co-star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani's character is so shallow that she can't see beyond pitt's good looks  
the movie's other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn't save meet joe black  
sir anthony hopkins isn't given much better material to work with , unfortunately  
he plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood  
 ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins's character more realistically evil  ) 
hopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world  
of course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder  
but i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire "

-1,"a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels  
first , there's the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie  
but occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery  
no no    
just kidding  
had you going there for a moment , didn't i ? 
in all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games  
the first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it's 5 billion inhabitants )  
the mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth  
unfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance  
the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game  
i'd even go so far as to say that many folks who didn't know about the game probably enjoyed the movie  
the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn't try to overachieve  
there were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot  
and , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office  
mortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie  
shao khan has decided that he's going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament  
thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid  
one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought "" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now  "" 
too bad they didn't simply stick with the formula from the first movie  
i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : 
 * the acting is truly bad  
sandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie )  
 * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i've * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder  
in the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics  
i generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim "" tiny "" lister , jr  being cast as the president of the u  s  in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite "" utility "" actors but he's so totally wrong for this part that he doesn't even have the luxury of amused self-awareness  
 * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again  
 * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva )  
for these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2    
    unless you're a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie  
in that case , the following critiques also apply : 
 * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter  
wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer  
hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene  
 * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more )  
sonya does her "" kiss of death , "" jax does his "" earthquake , "" liu kang does his "" animality , "" and so on "

-1,"my friend here in film school just made a two minute-long film for one of his classes that includes a staged anal rape scene , done by two guys and shot on the shadow of the incident , with a banana being used as the instrument of penetration  
as sick as this all is , watching it is one of the most admittingly hysterical moments i've ever witnessed  
sure , it may be in bad taste , but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive to some but is riotously amusing to the rest ? 
then there's "" caligula  "" 
this film features incest , necrophilia , beastuality , anal rape , homosexual felatio of both sexes , elaborate and lengthy orgies , a greased-up fist forced up a man's rear , wine poured down a man who's had his urinary tracts tied off , a penis chopped off and fed to hungry dogs , etc , etc , etc  this could very well be a respectable film , and if could have been had the following not occurred : a ) the events were graphically shot in clear view ; b ) the tone was not that of trying to shock comically but to , well , show "" historical accuracy ; "" c ) the film was a 20 million dollar production with lavish sets , a rather impressive cast , and a whopping 2 1/2 hour running time  
produced and funded by none other than bob guccione , owner of penthouse magazine , "" caligula "" comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since "" plan 9 from outer space "" because underneath there's a sense that everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified , but also brilliantly entertaining  
after all , it's not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments , but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry  
no film should be discarded because its content , because film is never about what it's about , it's about how it's about ( as the old cliche goes )  
those who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with "" caligula , "" and that's that it's nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish , without a second of credibility in its mammoth running time  
 "" caligula "" allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name , a man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as a blessing    or 
so i guess , even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons  
the film opens on the wrong note , of course , with a quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen , using the over-used passage "" what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul , "" depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer , fucking around with his own sister in a field ( i suppose if one has to lose their soul , one has to have a soul in the first place )  
the plot is so incomprehensibly done that all i or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula ( disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell , a performance that does the opposite that his performance in "" a clockwork orange "" did ) is next in line for the throne but can't wait for the current emporer , tiberius ( peter o' toole - ditto , only for his performance in "" lawrence of arabia "" ) , his grandfather , to die    so he kills him and ascends to the throne  
then he abuses his position , marries a woman ( helen mirren , who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting ) so he doesn't just have to sleep with his sister ( a dreadful teresa ann savoy , there to be pretty , naked , and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with ) , abuses his position a little more , a little more , and a little more , and then , i believe , invades england , then is killed off  
the filler , instead of recounting his life , is supposed to be , as guccione claims , the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome , complete with orgies , vicious deaths , and lots of nudity  
but instead of being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be , it instead becomes guccione's twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like  
oh , isn't it great that they just loved having sex ? 
and that they killed people so disgustingly ? 
and wouldn't it be great if i could make a couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though it's so blatantly real bad porn that i've completely convinced myself that it's not  
i mean , why not just show a roman orgy when i can spend a good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up  
and it's not just that it's disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film - it's that in a film where the entire feel it's going for isn't felt , it's also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time  
the sets are lavish , but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this  
but that doesn't matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if a light meter was used at all , making this not only dark and ugly , but just plain dark  
the camera operation is also the worst i've ever seen in my entire life  
not only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever , but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them , then have them out of focus  
the editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow  
there is no writer to speak of ( what the hell does it mean that it's "" adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal ? "" ) , but nevertheless , the dialogue is shit , so laughably bad that i can't in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over 5 could say them with a straight face ( my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius : "" he could go at any moment , but with care , he could last a year or so  "" ) 
the music in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian ( they use his gorgeous "" adagio of spartacus and phrygia , "" ad nauseum ) , used in an attempt to give the film some emotion , but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere  
the orgy scenes ( and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo ) are the result of reshoots by guccione himself , which are so obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the embrassment ( every five seconds or so , the film cuts to random nudity , as if it was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated "" x "" )  
john gielgud represents the only voice of sanity , walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra , "" i'm going to kill my agent , i'm going to kill my agent    "" 
and so on and so on , for over 2 1/2 hours , making "" caligula "" about as exciting and enriching as a three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously annoying  
guccione , in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made a film that is such a painstaking , arduous task to watch in its entirety that i doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage  
throughout the entire film , the presence of guccione is easily felt , as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen , pretentiously looking down upon us saying "" look what i can get away with ! 
and if you don't like this , then you're a prig , and worse than that , you know nothing about history ! "" 
uh huh  
there's a clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something that's artistically good  
a film which showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last - that would probably make for a good film  
but using historical accuracy as a licence to get away with any kind of disgusting-for-disgustingness'-sake acts is total , total bullshit , and all i can say is that guccione and the makers of this film have lost any kind of touch with either entertainment or eroticism , and have developed a pathetic and sadistic taste for both , judging from this film  
there's a film that came out in 1989 called "" the cook , the thief , his wife , and her lover , "" a magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway ( also starring helen mirren ) , which deals with graphic sex , heartstopping violence and gore , and even a little cannibalism for good measure  
that film not only never patronized its viewers , but also handled them in a way that was shocking , yes , but also , in a bizarre way , entertaining and totally involving "
-1,"movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good , the bad , and the despicable  
i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in '95 , but i wanted to re-write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics  
we need to be warned about some truly awful films , too  
this picture was so bad , it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below )  
the only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno  
so , it does indeed have some plusses    
in fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff  
and her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone  
this character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ? ) 
far too annoying far too often  
like in 1998s "" bulworth "" , when the movie was over i didn't care one little iota about the main character  
at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though  
 "" showgirls "" is too stupid to make a statement  
some people claim that the story is based on the legendary "" all about eve "" of all things ! 
if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l  mankiewicz was , he'd be    well , 
he'd be a good screenwriter  
instead , this project may have sunk his career  
he wrote the ( ha ha ! ) 
script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed  
the same team who created a good sex-film in 1992 ( "" basic instinct "" ) struck out here with their occasional violence , gratuitous x-rated sex scenes , and numerous ( and quite unnecessary ) lesbian overtones  
the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer  
after the supposed street-smart young "" lady "" gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack-jawed yokel in the opening sequence , she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the "" stardust hotel ""  
nomi doesn't take advantage of this contact to break into the big-time of dirty dancing right away  
first , she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club  
she sells her hot little wares at "" the cheetah "" for a short time , turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience  
hey , i never said she wasn't a hot number    
maybe it's that , her body , which gets her into the big-time when the star of the "" stardust hotel "" , crystal connors ( gina gershon ) stops into the strip club ( it certainly isn't her brains or pleasant disposition ! )  
crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend ( kyle maclachlan )  
he also happens to be the pleasure-seeking worm who runs the big show  
crystal gets nomi onto the "" stardust "" team and , after an interminable amount of time , nomi "" earns "" the role of crystal's understudy  
the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal  
it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she's "" not a whore ""  
that's a phrase we hear a few different times and it's completely ludicrous  
of course she is ! 
she sells her soul to make it big , but in the end we're supposed to believe that she's a better person than that  
we're supposed to root for her  
no way ! 
she's a tramp and a back-stabber who deserved nothing--least of all vindication in the    ahem "

this year's crop already seems inferior to that of past summers , even 1997's lackluster trio of batman & robin , the fifth element and the lost world  
the marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered on godzilla ( "" heeere , lee-zerd , lee-zerd    "" ) , which doesn't make me optimistic about future summers  
godzilla is , of course , based on a series of cult movies ( translation : really bad movies only a few people can tolerate ) from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turner-owned cable stations  
that this big-budget remake won't rise above its roots is fairly obvious  
the credits show us the origin of godzilla  
in five words : nuclear explosion creates giant lizard  
sounds like an enquirer headline , doesn't it ? 
the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable "" discovery "" sequence  
this time , a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling ( if that ain't a stereotype    ) 
when he discovers the telltale radar blip  
people die  
cut to our protagonist , played by matthew broderick  
he makes his first appearance wearing headphones , warbling along to "" singin' in the rain  "" 
it's a none-too-subtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie  
no dice , bueller  
from the beginning , poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzilla's enormous footprint  
every disaster movie has to have a know-it-all scientist , and this time broderick is it  
as the world's leading expert on radiated earthworms ( and wouldn't you love to have that printed on your business card ? ) , 
broderick is invaluable to the government  
he immediately dispels vicki lewis' theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because , hey , you can't take seriously the intellectual arguments of "" newsradio "" cast members  
broderick instead hits the nail on the head , announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard  
 "" the radiation isn't an anamoly , "" he announces , and lightning strikes  
 "" i believe this is a mutated abberation , "" he continues , and lightning strikes again  
it's vocabulary lightning , you see , activated by words of four syllables or more  
meanwhile , we're introduced to our new york cast , headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist ( maria patillo ) , broderick's former love  
gee , what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time ? 
poor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer  
italian cameraman hank azaria tells her she's not ruthless enough : "" nice doesn't get you anywhere in this town  
it's dog eat dog  "" 
actually , it's lizard eat city , as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apple's core  
the filmmakers provide us with a one-note drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla  
 "" i think i've got a bite , "" he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him  
you can guess what happens next  
similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city  
hearing the rumble of approaching footsteps , one new yorker remarks , "" please don't tell me that's another parade  "" 
please don't tell me that's the best line you could come up with  
mayor ebert is not pleased  
played by the principal from "" head of the class , "" he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option , and bickers with his assistant gene

-1,"sometimes , when i decide to write a short story or a poem , i think of a title first , and then think of a subject to go with it  
it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence  
i wouldn't be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits , and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it  
the title sequence is so good , so ominous and original , that it had me engrossed before the picture even began  
of course , my attention dwindled shortly into the film  
disturbing behavior , like so many thrillers , starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous  
it's a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex  
it's a suspense film with no suspense  
it's an evil small town story with no story to speak of  
it's a disaster , a listless and uninspired disaster , that just barely misses one-stardom because of a few good sequences , a mercifully short running time , and one terrific set of opening credits  
our main man is a fellow named steve clark , blandly played by jimmy marsden  
he moves to a small town with his family after , tragically , his brother shoots himself  
steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother ; we learn this through strange home-video like nightmares that he has occasionally  
the big trial for steve is , of course , to fit in at school and make new friends  
marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail , so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject  
as a social reject , he falls in with some pretentious dope-smoking philosophers , gavin ( nick stahl ) and rachel ( katie holmes )  
gavin informs steve that the local group of jocks , known as the blue ribboners , are actually a bunch of zombies , assimilating new members into their group , while sporadically killing innocent people  
so , it's up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1 ) solve the mystery , and 2 ) do something about it  
by the end of it all , something has happened and things have been explained , but the film still doesn't make any sense  
disturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg  
i've seen his name around recently ( he was one of the toucher-uppers on the armageddon script ) , and i imagine that , for the most part , he knows what he's doing when it comes to screenwriting  
he did , however , have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film , and then decided to actually take the time to write it out  
evil small town films are pretty common ( the last one , phantoms , is also a dismal failure ) , but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work  
rosenberg's script is a complete mess , lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization  
and it makes no sense , nor is their any purpose when things are finally "" explained  "" 
there is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks , but the film never explains exactly what * is * happening  
they get strapped to chairs , a microchip is inserted into their eyes , and -- poof -- they become sex-crazed , superviolent , machine-like creatures  
the doctor responsible for all this , dr  caldicott ( bruce greenwood ) , must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave ( or , perhaps , this is the only realistic element in the film )  
much of the writing is simply bad , and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act  
in one terrible scene , gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques , while pointing them out in the cafeteria  
up front , i should say that , in four years of high school , i did not eat in the cafeteria even once  
that aside , the various social groups he points out are general , uninteresting , and poorly-shown  
for instance , he points to the "" nerds , "" who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops  
it's such an obvious cliche that i can't believe rosenberg even bothered  
most of the dialogue is forced ( no one says , "" bite me ! "" 
anymore ) , and none of the scenes have any degree of wit  
this picture is not inspired , and most scenes flop from one to the other , with no sense of momentum or energy  
the blame for this can be placed on director david nutter , who apparently likes his films dry  
horror films should at least exploit violence , but this one is shockingly timid  
there are a few good scenes , though , such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum ( this is , however , the most forced scene in the film , for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn )  
i also liked the school janitor character , played by william sadler  
he has a few lines that are surprisingly thought-provoking  
the acting is largely a waste of talent "

-1,"some movies' pre-release buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when they're finally released , everyone just goes along with it  
thus sometimes , films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations  
last year it was the thin red line  
this year's "" winner "" is the hurricane , pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool  
acclaimed director norman jewison's biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun  
and that's supposed to be ok because , see , it's a true story  
it's about rubin "" hurricane "" carter ( denzel washington ) , a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly ( racist ! ) 
detective ( dan hedaya ) who's had it in for the "" big-shot "" hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife ( in self-defense but who cares , right ? ) 
when rubin was only ten  
he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole  
most of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison  
to the rescue -- lesra martin ( vicellous reon shannon ) and his team of wanna-be detectives  
lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three well-off canadian white people ( hanna , unger , schreiber ) to get an education  
lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his very first book -- "" the sixteenth round , "" rubin's autobiography  
immediately thereafter , schreiber's character tells lesra "" sometimes we don't pick the books we read , they pick us  "" 
hmmm  
after a few visits to the prison , they become convinced of rubin's innocence and launch their own full-scale investigation even though two juries have convicted him  
they meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses ( i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces ? ) and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane's innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings  
of course , we're already told that he's innocent  
a movie like this is especially frustrating because we're not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life  
all too obviously , we're getting the hollywood watered- down version  
that would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it  
it's almost cruel  
the melodrama isn't of the entertaining kind either ; it's the hokey , rammed-down-your-throat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity  
witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo-saintliness of our four protagonists  
the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it's a no-frills courtroom movie  
it's formula stripped to the bare necessities  
you have your wrongly accused black man  
you have your melodramatic final courtroom scene  
but there's nothing else  
you'd expect some sort of involving investigation  
but that's not necessary since we're implicitly informed of his innocence  
thus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding  
brooding to himself  
brooding to other inmates  
brooding to lesra  
brooding to lesra's canadian friends  
brooding in letters  
i don't think i'll ever look at brooding the same way again  
it wasn't long before i got tired of hearing the hurricane's exceedingly deep meditations on his condition  
i wanted something to happen  
as for washington's performance in the title role -- i figured i'd have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention it's received -- he is top notch , though still boring  
how is that possible ? 
well , he does what jewison wanted him to do perfectly  
unfortunately what jewison asked him to do is a load of crap  
what a waste of a great performer "

-1,"in our time  
in our modern world , where the cool rule , it's hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming 'the man'  
and yet - film after film , after film , is based on his everlasting magic  
in warner brothers' latest production , shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat , while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away  
though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare's 'romeo and juliet' , its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york , is very hard to associate with shakespeare's poetry  
the film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city - the afro americans against the chinese  
the youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered  
the afro-americans are immediately suspected , but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers  
it is at this point that han ( the romeo of the story ) finds out about his brother's death  
escaping from a prison in china , he returns to united states to avenge his brother's fate  
but before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks , he falls in love with a mysterious beauty  
the only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy   
there's only a weak echo of shakespeare's talent in this disappointing production  
and there are more problems besides its title  
of course we don't call it a deformation of a great masterpiece  
we call it 'modernization'  
it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics , without any car chases and gun fights  
this lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing  
kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn't need to be updated , because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature  
and as long as love , hate , honesty and corruption do exist , everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare  
i must admit that i found 'rome must die' very confusing  
i can forgive andrzej bartkowiak , since it is his first attempt at directing  
he manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision  
unfortunately he completely forgot about character- and story developments  
his latest picture is therefore visually impressive , but intellectually hollow  
the love story between han ( jet li ) and trish ( aalyah ) , and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified  
jet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice  
their achievement save this film from being completely braindead , but they are not actors , and therefore can not act  
they are nothing more than two celebrities put together  
the other actors , including isaiah washington , russell wong , henry o and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances  
delroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality  
but there's more than acting to worry about  
even with li's incredible skills in martial arts , the action scenes ( though technically excellent ) are too long and story updates simply embarrassing  
to make a long story short : 'romeo must die' is not intelligent enough to be a thriller , not sensual enough to be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film  
it is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to 'romeo and juliet' , so the film is completely stuck - not sure of what to be  
and in the end it's nothing  
there are no performances worthy of notice , no interesting character- or story surprises  
so again , the only good thing about it is its technical achievement  
this film can boast of great sound , fast paced editing , solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences  
the music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre  
it is mostly provided by aalyah's enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists , that create a kind of 'ghetto feel' to it  
but when i think back , it's not much i remember from this 'production' "

the strangest thing is that you would think nothing would go wrong with it  
it has a solid cast with tom hanks & meg ryan as the lead roles  
but you can never judge a movie by its cast    
if there is one good thing about joe vs the volcano , it is that the plot is original  
unfortunately , it is also incredibly stupid  
the movie begins with joe ( tom hanks ) going to work  
this opening sequence is very boring and slow  
it shows joe walking to his office  
but on the way , he has to wait in a long line passing by strange and slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious lighting

-1,"it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller  
some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others ( myself included ) would pick seven days in may  
both those films were tense exercises in chills  
the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man , john frankenheimer  
but that was 1962 and 1964 respectively  
for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films , but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed  
each of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot  
they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay  
the thrills all came from the plot  
ronin is like a film made by another man  
somewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot , but we see only tiny pieces of it  
we get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j  d  zeik's screenplay is a bit obscure  
the film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai  
when a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death , he becomes a ronin , much like a gunfighter in the american west  
if you miss the opening , do not worry  
this film will explain again what a ronin is  
sam ( played by robert de niro ) is the modern equivalent of a ronin  
he is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer  
he clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france  
sam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre ( natascha mcelhone of the truman show ) , an irish woman , to be part of an action to steal a mysterious metal case  
dierdre is very tight-lipped about what is in the case  
sam joins a team of four others : vincent ( jean reno of the professional/leon and mission impossible ) , spence ( sean bean , tv's richard sharpe , and also patriot games and goldeneye ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting )  
also along is larry ( skipp suddeth )  
the group seems to know their business , particularly sam , but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise  
their only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team  
the story is not very easy to follow  
it is never clear who is double-crossing whom and who is working for whom  
somehow russians ( who may or may not be the russian mafia ) and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case  
some very good actors are involved in this film  
one wonders what they saw in the script  
the characters are mostly one-dimensional professional killers  
they know their work , and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film , but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed  
by the end of the film we never really got to know anybody  
maybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts , since these are not very demanding characters to create  
in addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale ( the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal )  
as a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s , i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy  
unfortunately there are no deep characters , and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it  
i rate ronin a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale  
non-spoiler : incidentally , the tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times , usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin  
also one frequently sees in japanese art the image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet  
this is the first blow of the 47 ronin "
-1,"the classic story & the production which ruined it 
marking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 h  g  wells classic , new line cinema , armed with a stellar cast and expert make-up effects man stan winston ( alien , predator , terminator etc ) churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel  
of course , the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies , one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 , under the title the island of lost souls ( sounds like a much better title   )  
the story begins with edward douglas ( thewlis ) , a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific , who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery ( kilmer ) after his plane crashes into the sea  
douglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr  moreau , who incidently , owns the island and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize  
his host's reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreau's lab , when a monstrous birth was in progress  
even worse , the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal "" people  "" 
douglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beast-people community , which considers dr  moreau their maker  
using shock-therapy and the law , dr  moreau has long been able to keep his beast-people civilised to some extent but there are a few animal-men who are just too savage to be controlled  
the island of dr  
moreau questions the ability of men playing god  
dr  moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings which is free from hate and violence    but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long  
moreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp  
even so , the production has failed to make the most out of it  
there are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is , the characters are not "" prioritized "" so when the audience is led to believe that a particular character is important , before they know it , he or she or it perishes     rather 
ungloriously at times too  
perhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people , especially aissa ( balk ) , the most human of moreau's creations  
the two very important characters , montgomery and dr  moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably  
more screen time could have been used for character interaction and development  
i really would have liked it better if , say , they delved more into dr  moreau's obsession , montgomery's purpose in the story and justification to as why the beast-people had to rebel  
maybe the nature of the screenplay , which incidently , does not incorporate much action sequences in the film , forced the filmmakers to "" cut a long story short "" and make it more of an action film than anything else ( it's still summer , and movies have to be "" marketable "" )  
the special effects too , are really nothing for anyone to shout about  
at most , i would say the beast-men looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes  
this h  g  wells classic really has potential to be a good film  
unfortunately , after 2 adaptations , they still could not decide on how and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that important message which makes up the entire essence of the story  
as a third outing , the island of dr "

but it doesn't really make much of a difference  
deep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997  
remember when dante's peak came out in february ? 
a few months later , volcano was released  
the first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen  
the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent  
well , it's deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition  
this time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july  
of course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante's peak  
but while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film  
apparently many did , and it utterly baffles me  
to be completely honest , i haven't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life  
volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch  
deep impact doesn't just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot  
the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters  
deep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 )  
a line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above  
among these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski )  
leo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds  
he races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident  
a year passes , and nothing is heard about it again  
we are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc  
she gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell )  
she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie  
after talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help  
luckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain "" ellie "" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film    
that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled )  
before she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road  
they take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman )  
beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference  
naturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question  
and so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive  
they announce a plan called "" ark , "" which is their only hope for survival  
a computer will select 800 , 000 people at random  
these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won't kill off the entire human race  
after two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over  
the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning  
jenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom  
the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional "
-1,"`the skulls' is a laughably bad thriller , a teen-orientated doppelganger of `the firm' so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor  
certain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter  
i chuckled incessantly , all the way home  
let me share  
the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale ( designed , i'm sure , to mirror the actual skull & bones from the same college )  
luke mcnamara ( joshua jackson ) , a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year , highlights the latest skull scouting report  
despite some anxiety and caution from others , luke accepts entry into the organization  
soon after , he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women , driving a new car and marveling at the $20 , 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account  
yeah , dude , pretty good deal eh ? 
but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating ; when circumstances become extreme , there is no way he can leave the society - except maybe as a drooling vegetable  
the premise , although lacking in originality , certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense  
unfortunately , `the skulls' is neither intriguing , nor suspenseful , nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting  
it's just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack , the stars     
but not the script  
`the skulls' is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value , with the screenplay , by jon pogue , immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers  
first off , upon their initiation into the skulls , each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm  
afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar  
will they never take this watch off ? 
and what if they forget it by their bedside ? 
perhaps their ? secret' society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed  
on top of this , they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters  
gee , why not member t-shirts ? 
but my favorite bit is this : the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual ? agree' or ? disagree' notions when making collective decisions  
they are given official skull paddles  
when flipped to one side , they indicate the member agrees with the proposal  
facing the opposite way means a disagreement  
wouldn't they merely express themselves verbally ? 
hell no  
they have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote , and maybe afterward they can play ping-pong  
i'm still chuckling about these ludicrous details , but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest  
the cast , meanwhile , combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the `dawson's creek' crowd , and fuses the two together , ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout  
but not entirely  
accomplished actors like craig t  nelson ( as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake ) and william peterson ( as fellow board member senator levritt ) are dealt pathetic villain caricatures , and look suitably embarrassed handling them  
and then there's christopher mcdonald , who has the capacity to be a fun , exciting actor  
mcdonald's charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role ( yes , pogue makes it a hat-trick )  
i pray it was a `snatch-the-paycheck-and-run' exercise for all these actors  
the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better  
let's cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character  
paul walker , the strapping quarterback from `varsity blues' , is bland but passable as caleb mandrake - the judge's son  
walker preserves a straight face , even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie ( `dad , i just killed a guy in the ritual room ! ' )  
some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb , who plays luke's longtime chum chloe , and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics  
it really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one  
or maybe not minute one , thanks to a decent set-up from director rob cohen , who films early sequences with a sense of atmosphere and style  
it makes you wonder why he didn't flee indefinitely from the project , because while enjoyable cheese like `dragonheart' and the moderate stallone thriller `daylight' aren't superior cinema , they belong on the afi top 100 list when compared to this degrading trash "

directed by terry gilliam 
i've always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid  
dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded ; you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are , no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat , and no idea how long the ride will last  
then there's the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine-laced dose  
mushrooms , on the other hand , offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel : a steady , reassuring assent , a short period of thrilling motion and color , and then a smooth landing  
acid is for daredevils ; mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy  
my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas , director terry gilliam has made an acid movie , when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie  
full of shocking sight gags , aggressive images and grotesque comic performances , the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s  thompson's book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world-view from the inside out  
but for those of us who just want to enjoy a well-made film , gilliam has produced a mixed bag  
fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self-professed "" gonzo "" journalist hunter s  thompson ( johnny depp ) and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta ( benicio del toro ) , came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorney's convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971  
operating under the pseudonyms of "" raoul duke "" and "" dr  
gonzo "" , the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender , then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite , cocaine , tequila and a rainbow of multi-colored uppers and downers  
they terrorize every one they meet , mostly because every one they meet terrifies them  
duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town , then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge  
dr  gonzo becomes enamored of a thick-bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane's "" white rabbit "" reaches its climax  
and these guys don't just trash hotel rooms - they rape them , humiliate them and leave them for dead  
that neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence , depending on your point of view  
thompson's book , besides being a hilarious read , has stood the test of time as an important historical document  
it simultaneously exposed the 60's drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die  
pontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson's message , but the truth is that , stripped to its bare essentials , what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy  
it's a cheech and chong movie  
you're there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results : see johnny take drugs , see johnny fall down  
there's nothing wrong with this concept , but gilliam tries too hard  
this is a frantic movie - all sweaty close-ups , wide-angle lenses , dutch tilts and other-worldly lighting schemes  
there are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen  
but to what end ? 
much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson's book , and there are some priceless comic observations  
but you're hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work  
this brings us to the performances , which strike me as all wrong  
depp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c  scott in patton - a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson's dialogue  
in between his several puking scenes , del toro fares better as dr  gonzo , but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost  
watching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago , with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads - now that would have been something to see  
it's interesting to note that alex cox , credited as a co-writer on the screenplay , was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over  
as much of a fan as i am of gilliam's work , cox would have been the better choice  
sid and nancy , cox's best work , covered essentially the same subject matter , but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film  
gilliam commits the compound sin of over-directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose  
what kind of movie was he trying to make , anyway ? 
it doesn't try to be a cautionary tale , and it doesn't work as broad comedy  
if he had considered more carefully his purpose , the result would have been a much more interesting film  
but i don't want to be too hard on it  
there are some truly funny moments , and if you're in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it "

-1,"according to popular film opinion , a film's greatness is determined by time  
take for example "" casablanca  "" 
great film , even today  
it's still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic  
another example would be "" star wars , "" which had a very , very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion times before  
but as i rewatched "" independence day "" when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996 , i kinda felt like it wasn't as cool as when i had first seen it  
i had liked it when i saw it the first time ( * * * was my original view ) and basically saw it as a good "" escape film  "" 
but when i rewatched it , i felt cheated  
thus , the curse of the "" event film  "" 
 "" independence day "" is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once ( except for a couple kids - the critics , in this situation )  
but after a while , this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one  
well , this kid is the "" event film "" in my little analogy  
and when i rewatched "" independence day , "" not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen , but i felt insulted the whole time  
there are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just aren't sure if it's comedy or hokey drama  
one scene , you'll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch ; the next you'll see a bunch of military uptight guys walking around , saying corny lines  
the worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of "" glen or glenda ? "" 
now this annoying kid's problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once , he shows he has no balls  
and "" independence day "" has no balls  
it plays it safe everywhere  
it throws in a ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films  
the chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of "" star wars  "" 
i mean , isn't that devil's den ? 
and the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moore's breasts in "" striptease  "" 
they're these octopus men , boring freaking octopus men  
i mean , come on  
the aliens in "" 2001 "" were more interesting and you didn't even see them ! 
basically the plot is straight from a b-movie from the 50s : aliens come to earth and we wonder if they're hostile or peaceful  
okay , it's an interesting topic , but it's not handled greatly  
now they aren't and somehow a computer geek , jeff goldblum , figure out they're using our satellites as a countdown to destruction  
yep  
these aliens are not only heavily armed , they're stupid too  
they also use the same kind of computer as we do , but that comes about later  
the president ( bill pullman ) , who's under attack for being a wimp , decides this would be a nice time to be belligerent , and he decides he'll stay in the white house which the aliens have covered  
i don't care if it's bob freaking dole in the white house , get him out of there  
i don't care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol , just get him out of there  
later on , he's stupid and wants to fly in the attack on a big alien ship  
i think it's time for impeachment for this guy  
he's more senile than reagan on pot  
then there's a cocky pilot ( will smith ) who is the only person to survive the counter-attack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area 51 ( the film's only sign of being brave )  
his girlfriend's a stripper sharing a subplot with "" striptease "" in that she has to do it for her son  
come on , she has a fighter pilot boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance  
i think she can quit that job and get a more respectable job at long john silvers  
she's also the few , the proud , the lucky to survive the igniting of l  a  ( as well as her dog , who narrowly survives )  
there are some bright spots "

-1,"when respecting a director , you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect  
woody allen has made a couple less-than good films , and he's my favorite  
even martin scorsese hasn't had a perfect track record  
kevin smith , after a smashing debut with the classic "" clerks "" stooped as low to sell-out and make the dreadful "" mallrats  "" 
i mean , so far the only director who's made several films , none of which have been bad is richard linklater ( "" slacker , "" "" dazed and confused , "" "" before sunrise , "" and "" suburbia ""    all 
which were great )  
now , i adore quentin tarantino  
his first two films were classic films , the second one being one of the greatest films of all time  
but 1995 just wasn't that good of a year for him  
he made way too many tv appearances  
he mispronounced jackie chan's name on the mtv movie awards  
and he made this film  
 ( he was also awarded an oscar , so i guess that would be a grand exception )  
robert rodriguez is also a great director ; not a brilliant one , but a cool one  
i've never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film , so i can't comment on them  
but in this crap ensemble director's film , all four give pitiful efforts  
pitiful for any director , too  
now in all fairness , ensemble director pieces never really work out  
i've never seen all of "" new york stories , "" but have heard the first two films , by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap ( i saw woody's one , which was hilarious but not totally up to par )  but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film  
exposition : a simple one - a bellhop , ted ( the totally overdone tim roth , who's a god and all , but not in this one , though he has a couple good moments ) is working on new year's eve for his first shift ( ! ! ! ) in an old fancy hotel  
he's the only one there ( again : ! ! ! ) and he only has a couple rooms ( yet again : ! ! ! )  
the old bellhop ( the seemingly immortal marc lawrence - who hated pulp fiction actually ) hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily  
as the night goes on , he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile  
yea  
 ( the short films are presented in order , btw ) : 
the missing ingredient writer/director : allison anders starring : sammi davis , amanda decadenet , valeria golino , madonna , ione skye , lili taylor , alicia witt 
this one starts it off horribly with no plot , no intrigue , and crap dialogue  
the situation is so terrible that it's physically painful to watch  
the plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is ( gasp ! ) 
stuck inside some object in their hotel room  
the witch that was supposed to bring it ( ione skye ) calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it  
yeah , that's what i said  
stupid plot , inane characters who aren't interesting at all , etc , etc , etc  the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which , in turn , it wastes pitifully  
not even actually funny for a second  
my rating ( out of 5 ) : no stars ! ! ! ! 
the wrong man writer/director : alexandre rockwell starring : david proval , jennifer beals and laurence bender 
another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on  
ted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple ( david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at "" coming back "" ) who are playing sex games  
ted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon  
but at least this has a bit of comedy in it , just not that much  
and david proval has never overacted as much  
and it's "" pulp fiction "" producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window  
a masterpiece compared to the first one , but still  "

sure , i'd seen them all at least once , but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra-serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv  
even though "" dragnet "" is out of circulation at the moment , we webb anti-fans still have the d  i  , a 50's propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous "" blue boy "" episode of "" dragnet  "" 
for anyone like me who got laughs out of webb's rapid-fire speeches and straight-faced seriousness , think of the d  i  
as what would happen if sgt  
joe friday ever enlisted , because he plays exactly the same character here , a no-nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long- winded , melodramatic speeches on any topic  
in this election year , i'm more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth  
the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb's office door and enters  
he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up  
the "" produced and directed by jack webb "" card pretty much goes without saying  
this is his movie all the way , and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason , i was wondering if there would even be a plot  
i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants , but the d  i  
gives us more -- much more  
webb's mission is to make a man out of private owens , the local screw-up  
the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or , the captain will "" personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself  "" 
 ( whether the "" lace panties "" part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered  ) 
this , of course , gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens' life a living hell  
for those of you who haven't been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching , here's a reprint of a typical monologue of his  
i can't duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper , but the words should at least partially convey what i'm talking about    
 "" now you listen to me , youngster  
someday you'll wake up fighting on a beach and you'll pray to god somebody doesn't get killed because of your foolishness    
i've got a headline for you : every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours , you're gonna turn around and i'll be standing right there  "" 
i couldn't write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d  i  
 ( nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame ) , but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines , like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day's work by going to the local bar ( where he orders a tomato juice )  
he meets a woman who , coincidentally , also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typically-stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch-rival , another marine d  i  
webb marches over to the table , gets up in her face and says , "" just what kind of a dame do you think you are ? "" 
bogart he ain't  
the other d  i  
gets one of the few memorable non-webb lines when he confesses to the girl , "" he's a damn good d  i

the teenage romance  
an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies , and in the end , the guy always gets the girl  
and with the arrival of the breakout hit `she's all that' last year ( followed by a long catalogue of imitators including `10 things i hate about you' and `drive me crazy' ) , the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity  
along now comes `down to you'  
the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid `she's all that' craze with their latest project , which has the studdly freddie prinze jr  attached and all  
only `down to you' doesn't have the ? unlikely scenario' mentioned above  
it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance - a dull , unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we're accustomed to  
this is the kind of romance that only giggly 12-year old girls will find convincing  
in strictly textbook fashion , college sophomore and aspiring chef al ( prinze jr  ) meets freshman artist imogen ( julia stiles )  
they hit it off like a couple can only in the movies  
from here , it's the standard boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-drinks-entire-bottle-of-shampoo-and-may-or-may-not-get-girl-back story  
the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters , who are frequently taking part in activities that     
well , only happen in the movies  
fortunately , the cast of `down to you' has a certain appeal  
freddie prinze jr  and julia stiles are an adorable couple , and when on screen together , they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around  
zak orth , as the newly realized porn star monk , shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film's intelligent dialogue  
rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy ( `the faculty' ) , selma blair ( `cruel intentions' ) and ashton kutcher ( tv's `that 70's shows' )  
even the fonz himself - henry winkler , the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia - has a welcome role as al's dad , the host of the popular cooking program `chef ray'  
maybe the concept of `down to you' looked good on paper to draw such a crowd  
as a feature film , however , the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely  
perhaps worst of all , `down to you' is not funny  
the jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired  
the characters on screen , often laughing at each other's goofy/embarrassing antics , seemed far more amused than the audience  
even the giggly 12-year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run it's course  
the one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr  in a fantasy sequence called `cooks' , a `cops' take-off in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for ? needy' families ( with the assistance of a fully-armed swat team , of course )  
when this is the highlight reel , you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired  
in order to make a teen comedy work , you've got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity  
`10 things i hate about you' actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards , and the result was refreshing  
no such luck with `down to you'  
it's just a textbook romance where , despite absurd circumstances , everything is bound to work out in the end  
and at the end of the whole clich ? d ordeal , the nicest thing you could possibly say would be `     
only in the movies' "

-1,"dear god , this is a fantastically bad film ! 
regardless of what i say about knock off , you can't grasp its awfulness from my words  
you have to see it and experience it for yourself  
here's the kicker , though -- i suggest that you do so  
yes , this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure  
in fact , i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time , despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story  
don't get me wrong : i'm not excusing knock off  
it reaches an unacceptable level of badness ; it's so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was  
it also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon , michael wong , paul sorvino , and -- of course -- jean-claude van damme  
it does , however , have the entertaining presence of rob schneider , and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark  
as i watched it , i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness  
now , in retrospect , it seems clear that it wasn't , but it's still a fascinating kind of mess  
i don't like writing plot descriptions ( it is , by far , the most boring part of writing a review ) , but , in this case , i'm off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off  
for the sake of comparison , i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing  
i paid closer attention to knock off , and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray , and is accused by the cia ( i think ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are , of course , products that look like name-brand materials but are generic and cheap )  
i don't know what any of this has to do with martial arts , but there are lots of martial arts in the film  
ray is good at martial arts , so when he has to beat up bad guys , there's no problem  
rob schneider plays his sidekick , although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film  
lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff , while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once ! 
in fact , every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do  
in that order , knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense  
but what a strange mess it is  
it was written by stephen e  de souza , who also wrote die hard and 48 hours  
can this be the same man ? 
i don't see how , unless , of course , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time  
knock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go ) , but there's no semblance here  
for instance , van damme is introduced , and then seconds later he's running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong  
why ? 
who knows  
what are the implications of this ? 
i have no idea  
most action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem  
knock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut  
the acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity  
sorvino , in addition , deserves better than this  
van damme is bad , but he's charming in that bad way , and so i can't say that he's hard to watch ( although i rarely understood what he was saying )  
the only exception is rob schneider , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time  
tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison  
they're all pointless gimmicks though , such as shots of the inner-workings of a knock off running shoe  
but his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ? ) is well-choreographed  
lots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy , such as our heroes' first encounter with the rochon character  
but did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous ? 
i hope he did , for the alternative is a frightening thought  
knock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania  
if it were boring , i'd give it zero stars  
but it's not boring : it's loud and excessive and completely incoherent  
it's also funny , even when it isn't meaning to be funny  
a bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesn't deserve to be fully lambasted "

-1,"wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day ? provided , of course , that you're the victim of a frontal lobotomy  
there is , in fact , no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at : movie-goers in their late teens and early twenties -- the most lucrative target group  
this is film noir for the mtv generation : fast-paced , slick , flashy , gleefully mindless , and hollow to the core  
wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998  
i've seen more convincing drama ( with nearly as much bare flesh ) on that pinnacle of narrative quality , baywatch  
wild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it's a thriller with a real story  
what it is , however , is a series of increasingly- improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists  
everything in between those serpentine moments is filler -- a flash of a breast , a spatter of blood , and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie  
the film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess -- just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen , and that will probably be it  
using this approach , i was right three times and wrong only once  
that's not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what's around the next corner  
the ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie : the hot , young cast and the old standby , sex  
both have an abundance of screen time , although i'll admit that the film's erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected  
nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu ?  
the soft-core sex sequences are generic , and don't generate much heat  
the lesbian kisses can't hold a candle to those in bound  
theresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances ( neve campbell , possessing an iron-clad "" no nudity "" clause in her contract , keeps her clothes more or less on )  
the film's greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower  
maybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully-clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick ( mrs  
kevin bacon ) is familiar with  
the director of wild things is john mcnaughton , whose last effort was the finely-tuned psychological thriller , normal life  
that movie featured copious sex , a pair of real characters , and a powerful script  
it's difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker  
but i suppose we all need to put food on the table  
mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here , in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success ( his previous wide-release picture , mad dog and glory , was a box-office disappointment )  
quick cuts and pretty sunrises can't even begin to cover up this movie's flaws  
the main character ( and i use that term lightly , since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality ) is sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a guidance counselor at florida's blue bay high school  
a student , the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , has a crush on him  
one afternoon , she comes to his house to wash his car , and , when she leaves , her clothing is torn  
after confessing to her mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped , she goes to the police station , where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega )  
they are skeptical about here claims until another girl , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , comes forward with a similar tale  
meanwhile , sam , convinced that he's being set up , goes to a shyster lawyer ( bill murray ) for help  
the acting in wild things isn't very good , but none of the principals have much to work with  
this is definitely not a character- based motion picture  
not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a triple-digit i  q  , but it doesn't bother to give any of the on-screen individuals even a hint of depth  
the men and women populating the picture are there to look nice , but nothing more  
matt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps  
neve campbell gets to model the slutty look  
denise richards strikes a fetching pose in a see-through , one-piece bathing suit  
and nothing in the film gets a rise out of kevin bacon  
the only one who's even remotely interesting is bill murray , and he seems to think he's in comedy , not a thriller ( maybe he's got the right idea ) "

-1,"200 cigarettes takes place on new year's eve 1981  
monica , played by martha plimpton is having a huge new year's party  
everyone in town is trying to get there , but some are caught up in other things  
this is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes  
as we meet the characters headed towards the party , we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal , and not interesting at all  
this disappointed me greatly  
the film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion  
lucy , played by courtney love , is with kevin , played by paul rudd  
the two are in a relationship that is more of a friendship , but starts to blossom into something more than that  
this subplot is extremely boring and dull , and i am getting quite sick of plots like that  
janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot , dealing with kevin  
she plays ellie , an ex-girlfriend of kevin's  
this subplot is completely a waste of garofalo's talent  
there was no point to it at all , and it was hardly even in the movie  
when lucy runs into a bartender , played by ben affleck , another subplot is formed  
the bartender is invited by lucy to come to monica's party  
at the bar , he runs into two more girls  
the girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker , but unfortunately , due to the terrible acting of both of them , i don't even remember their characters names  
ben affleck is a good actor , but his character doesn't go anywhere so he doesn't have much screen time to give a good performance  
featherstone and parker are horrible in their roles , and they are part of the reason the film is so bad  
christina ricci plays val , and gaby hoffman plays stephie  
the two girls are trying to get to the party but are extremely lost  
they meet some guys and end up going around with them all night  
this subplot was alright , but it was quite annoying with stephie's accent  
hoffman did an okay job of acting , but ricci did good  
she was underused , considering she is such a wonderful actress  
another subplot in the film is the relationship between cindy , played by goldie hawn's daughter , and jack , played by jay mohr  
jack is an actor who doesn't care about the girls he goes out with , he just likes dates for one night , and the next day he doesn't  
kate hudson is a huge klutz  
she gets herself into very funny situations , that are the funniest parts in the entire movie  
they are probably the only funny parts in the entire movie as well  
this subplot could have been used more , mainly due to hudson's performance  
mohr wasn't good , but he wasn't bad  
he was just alright , which i didn't find acceptable  
there is not much to say about the performances in the film  
none of the characters are developed or shown enough to really tell if the acting is good or not  
the only performances that i can judge are christina ricci's as always good performance , kate hudson's funny role , courtney love's mediocre performance , and paul rudd's annoying and overused performance  
i was hoping for a little more out of jaw mohr , ben affleck , casey affleck , gaby hoffman , dave chapelle , and especially out of janeane garofalo  
the two strongest things in the film were the great soundtrack and the original costumes  
martha plimpton and christina ricci had very different and original outfits which made me feel like i was in the year 1981  
the soundtrack is full of 1980's tunes , ranging from "" i want candy "" to "" tainted love  "" 
the songs in the movie also helped create the feel that you were back in the 1980s  
during the film , i often found myself asking the questions , "" is there a reason to this ? 
is there any moral story ? 
is there a point ? 
are any of the events going on in the film necessary ? 
do i care what lucy and kevin are going through ? "" 
the movie is extremely boring , and by the time they reached eleven-o-clock , one hour before midnight , i could not wait for the movie to be over "

-1,"my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love  
i love ralph fiennes  
i love uma thurman  
i love sean connery  
hell , i'm even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw  
i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i've been eagerly awaiting the film ever since  
a few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground  
then , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics  
and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs  
and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique  
my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things  
the film i saw today didn't even meet those expectations  
this is a lousy , incoherent mess  
i would slam it harder , if it weren't for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors  
but sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired  
that's the main problem with the avengers : for all it's hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired  
it's like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making  
it also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots  
this is just plain depressing  
the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show  
frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i've never watched an episode  
i wasn't alive then  
i don't even watch television now  
i'm very sorry that i don't have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i've already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse  
i didn't know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles  
i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film  
based on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr  peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits  
they are to work together , under mother's orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw )  
it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather  
his name is de wynter ( connery )  
he is a crazy scottish guy  
our heroes had better stop him , or else  
  
  
the weather will keep getting colder until they "" have to go to hell to warm up "" ( one of the film's few funny lines )  
along the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense  
for example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos  
now , killer bugs don't really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film  
the purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established  
they're never even directly connected to de wynter ( they're controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard )  
the special effects aren't bad , but they're loud , obnoxious , and intrusive  
like so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning "

-1,"there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors  
when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture  
you see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries  
i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories  
i hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac's shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey  
the badness of patch adams is stupefying  
it's confounding  
i can't believe a film can be this bad  
and yet , it's based on a real man who probably has a good point to make  
in the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human  
in the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn't want to kill himself  
while there , he notices that the doctors don't care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings  
so , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients  
he goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it's good to help people  
he also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor  
naturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams  
so patch decides that he's going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have  
and that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998  
on a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn't say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter's performance , even if she is wasted )  
but the film fails fundamentally in execution  
every scene swells with grand , "" emotional "" music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard  
take , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus  
we don't know patch yet , but there's sad music , and it's supposed to make us really sad that he's sad  
later on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively  
and when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad  
but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions  
real drama is character-based  
you grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it  
we don't ever grow to know the dying patient ; he's simply a vehicle for patch's greatness  
real drama doesn't seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry  
that's why patch adams is not real drama  
it goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene  
even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman's sickening musical score  
sentimentality like this is indeed bad  
but it's not as bad as half-baked , simplistic themes  
you see , patch is a really great student  
he aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he's cheating  
but patch doesn't think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor  
 "" why don't we see patients until the third year ? "" he bursts out every three seconds  
well , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients  
not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort  
most of us have to study  
and a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn't know a toe from a finger , probably won't be too successful in preventing death "

-1,"you think that these people only exist in the movies , but trust me , they're as real as life  
i once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person's brain with microwaves  
then i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections  
i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted  
these people had what are known as "" conspiracy theories "" - ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public  
a little imagination goes a long way  
in richard donner's conspiracy theory , jerry fletcher ( mel gibson ) is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything  
his latest , that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle , might sound outrageous to us , but is all in a day's work for him  
he combs the newspaper , looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings-on behind the scenes , and from there jerry draws his conclusions  
upstanding citizen that he is , he tries to convince alice sutton ( julia roberts ) of the justice department that the president must be warned  
lucky gal , alice , who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since  
what she doesn't know is that jerry's interest in her is far more than , well , professional  
he goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment  
but when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry's ideas and his limited-circulation "" conspiracy theory "" newsletter , he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice's help  
one of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action-thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action , nor a significant number of thrills  
part of this is a result of the film's slow pace  
it takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice , and even once that is over with , the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement  
at over two hours , this film could have been significantly condensed and had it's running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour , but even then , the action scenes would not be able to save the film  
instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces , we're treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite "" black elements "" : black helicopter , men in black action suits and body armor , black vehicles - you know the drill  
they come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons , but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time  
big deal , we've seen it all before  
watching the film , i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination , but i was out of luck  
now , when i say it took forever to set up the "" relationship "" between jerry and alice , i completely mean what one person is relative to the other , and not romantic involvement  
oh , donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie , the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other , but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring  
you see , there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies ( also directed by donner ) than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory  
the two just don't click , and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether ( like finding out he's been stalking her ) , the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced  
the script in general also seems forced , like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it , then took it and forced it upon us  
dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening  
even gibson's usual gift for ad lib couldn't punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest , although one of jerry's theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing  
unfortunately , much of what's discussed in the film is not inherently important to what's going on , but instead filler that starts out with potential , but ends up just being extraneous because it's never followed through  
for example , jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station  
he even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break ( hence the water in a subway station ) , and that the coroner should check the man's lungs for chlorine  
this is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him  
you know what happens then ? 
nothing , zip , nada  
no follow-up whatsoever , so what's the significance ? 
okay , here's another one  
a couple of well known ( real life ) assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j  d  salinger novel "" the catcher in the rye ""  
jerry also has a bunch of copies  
whenever he goes into a bookstore , he has to buy one  
leaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin , we're never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin  
not when we find out about his salinger collection , not when he goes to the bookstore , not later on when we get the answer to our first question  
the point becomes totally extraneous "

-1,"writer/director lawrence kasdan had a hand in penning some of the biggest film successes of the 1980s  
yes , that's right , he co-wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 ) , the empire strikes back ( 8  5/10 ) and return of the jedi ( 8/10 )  
now with this film , it looks as though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing  
and guess what ? 
he succeeds once again ! 
plot : a man with a shady and regrettable past decides to run away and into a small american town , where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an open-armed swarm of people with problems  
it isn't long before he befriends the small-town billionaire , folks become suspicious and he falls for one of his own patients  
critique : this film is not a comedy ! 
it is a drama  
i say this right up front because from the looks of the trailer , you would think that this film secures its base in humor , but unfortunately for us , it does not  
it is a serious film ( seriously flawed if you ask me , but i digress ) which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake , but overall , just sits there  
now on to my review  
this movie sucks because it was slow and boring , starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past , included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst , and certified it all with many a predictable ending  
i have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture , but whatever it was    he 
missed ! 
anyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puff-piece , which on a good day , might be described as predictably digestible  
it's no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy ! 
it sucks as a drama , and bored my movie cohort right to sleep  
i've given it four points on four extremely shallow yet distinguishable marks  
first of all , i couldn't help but think about how much the lead actor , loren dean , looked like a young charles grodin  
he even acted like him , save for the dry , sardonic wit  
this kept me interested in watching him at least  
number two , and this one is really shallow ( seemed to be geared that way as well ) , there were quite a few "" titshots "" , as they would say back in high school  
and god help me if i can't get enough of those in an aimless drama  
and three , and this one surprised me the most , actor ted danson's cameo ( yes , he will always be sam malone to us real fans ! ) was the best part about this movie and actually made me see him as a different person  
a different asshole , but a different person nonetheless  
if ever you rent this movie one day ( promise you won't throw away your hard-earned money at the theaters ? ! ) , 
wait for his scene because it's actually pretty good  
other than that , drab , drab , drab and drab  
even jason lee , a personal favorite of mine , was left out to dry with lame dialogue and one of the phoniest romances to hit the big screen in a while  
well , at least he finally "" came out "" and did some real skateboarding in this movie ! 
oh yeah , and i guess that's the fourth point in my rating  
anyway , if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about their boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist    this 
film's your bag ! 
otherwise , skip it and see analyze this ( 8/10 ) again    now 
there's a great shrink movie ! 
little known facts about this film and its stars : "" three's company "" fans alert ! ! ! 
terri from the tv show , also known as actress priscilla barnes , plays a small but pivotal part as the landlady in this film  
the scene is actually a fantasy sequence and does feature cleavage , so stay tuned , kids ! 
also , it is to note that the actress was once named "" penthouse pet of the month "" in march of 1976  
she was known as one joann witty back then  
she's originally from jersey  
who the hell is loren dean , the dude who plays mumford in this film ? 
you got me , but all i know is that he was born in las vegas in 1969 and played the character of billy bathgate in the 1991 film of the same name  
jason lee was born in the state of california in the year of 1971  
he was a professional skateboarder before his acting career took off after mallrats ( 6/10 ) , and even owns his own skateboarding company called stereo manufacturing corp  he's been in every kevin smith film except for clerks ( 8  5/10 ) "
-1,
-1,"the last line ( or near to that honor ) is the great butler , alfred ( the ubergod , michael gough ) saying , "" i think we need a bigger bat cave , "" or something to that note  
that's exactly what this film is - too big for its own good because it has too damn much  
cut batgirl out  
cut one of the villains  
it's too much to handle in one dosage  
it's so much that characters get left behind  
poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way , shape or form  
and elle deserves better  
this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher  
it's also the fourth worst in the series ( and second worst from joel )  
the series has been declining since its stunning debut , followed by the almost-as-stunning sequel and then the anti-climactic third one ( first by joel )  
this one's not anti-climactic - i knew it was gonna suck  
it's up to joel to make it fun though  
 "" batman forever "" was fun  
this is a big bore of over-produced action sequences and shallow characters  
i mean , this one bit  
i'm gonna put all the plot in one paragraph : mr  freeze ( ah-nold ) , who's wife was dying of some disease , has become the new big villain these days  
he's a huge ex-scientist who fell into some weird liquid ( hello ? 
joker ? ) and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body  
batman ( george ) and robin ( chris ) fight him a bit but find they're growing apart  
meanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he's used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had  
she emerges from her chemicals ( don't ask 'cause i can't tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who's poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people  
she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo  
meanwhile , alfred's dying of the same disease mr  freeze's wife has ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and his niece , barbara ( alicia ) , comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not really soon , it takes her 2 hours ) becomes batgirl  
meanwhile , in an unfinished subplot , bruce ( batman's alter-ego , if you forgot ) has been dating the lovely julie madison ( the even lovlier elle macpherson ) who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing  
end of her for all we know  
mr  freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population ( don't ask ! ! ! )  
the trio must team together "" as family "" to beat them  
there ya go  
not the whole story but no big context clues  
too much , right ? 
right ! 
the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels  
however , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one  
he gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that's it  
maybe some stunts  
for all this , i can't even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy ! 
and when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say  
i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode  
george is in between them  
he's not quintessential , he's not horrible , he's good  
but i'm sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they'll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we'll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job )  
the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher  
last time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey "
-1,"this is an adaptation of h  g  wells' acclaimed novel 'the invisible man'  
the actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue  
the director is paul verhoven  
that , plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer , should be enough to lure us into the theatre  
the problem is to keep us there  
i can't imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time  
working on a top secret military project , sebastian caine ( kevin beacon ) -- an eccentric genius , that calls himself "" god "" , has discovered the secret to invisibility  
the first two faces are completed  
now , it is time for "" the next logical step "" -- human  
caine volunteers for this risky experiment  
but when he is made invisible , something goes wrong  
while his ex-girlfriend linda ( elisabeth shue ) desperately tries to find something to return him to normal , he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower  
but that's not the bad thing -- an unexpected side-effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania  
he is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers , just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine  
soon every sense of decency is forgotten  
the little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien-rip-off , where caine is walking like a half finished terminator , spooking , scaring and killing everybody  
though it's based on a novel called 'the invisible man' , the title has been ironically changed to 'hollow man' that sums up the film very nicely  
this is a very silly production  
laughable , actually  
apparently verhoven's imagination doesn't stretch too far  
for him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls' locker room undetected  
it is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie  
being invisible , gives you the opportunity to be who you are , to do what you want without being influenced by society  
in many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences  
the nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about  
all that , the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat  
caine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man  
but since this is a modernization , in other words a dehumanization , he doesn't stop there  
he becomes a rapist  
and then , of course , a murderer  
you'll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place  
shue's talent is barely seen , josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent  
kevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully  
his face is not seen for the most part of the film , and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice  
there are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing  
in the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place  
being probably the best technical achievement since "" jurassic park "" , they are absolutely amazing  
we observe the layers of skin , muscle , tissue , and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly rendered invisible  
we see a beating heart , inflating lungs , and veins pulsing with newly-pumped blood  
there are a couple of inventive shots with smoke , fire , air and water , but are a few scenes like that worth attending a movie for ? 
what is truly disturbing is that with a great book , talented actors and a grand budget , this could have been so much more  
pretty much like jan de bont ( "" twister "" , "" haunting "" ) , paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary "
-1,"in french , the phrase "" film noir "" literally means "" black film  "" 
webster defines it as "" a type of crime film featuring cynical malevolent characters in a sleazy setting and an ominous atmosphere that is conveyed by shadowy photography and foreboding background music  "" 
classic film noir , including such memorable fare as "" the big sleep , "" the original "" cape fear , "" and orson welles' striking "" a touch of evil , "" employed black and white photography to emphasize the long shadows associated with the genre  
color came into play with neo-noir films like "" chinatown "" and "" blade runner  "" 
 "" l  a  confidential , "" easily the best film of 1997 , is a wonderful piece of contemporary neo-noir filmmaking  
for a textbook example of how to take all the elements of neo-noir and create an absolute mess , there's "" palmetto  "" 
based on "" just another sucker , "" a short story written by british author rene raymond under the pseudonym james hadley chase , "" palmetto "" shows what happens when a filmmaker puts style ahead of substance  
director volker schlondorff ( "" tin drum , "" the handmaid's tale "" ) stated "" we weren't even sure for a long time if it was going to be a thriller or a comedy  "" 
it shows  
 "" palmetto "" is too preposterous too be taken seriously as a thriller and too ponderous to work as a comedy  
the story begins when journalist harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is released from prison  
someone turned state's witness and revealed that harry was framed , a "" reward "" for blowing the lid on corruption in the small florida town of palmetto  
bitter and broke , harry plans to hitchhike to miami and start his life over , but ex-girlfriend nina ( gina gershon ) appears to return him to palmetto  
while hanging out at a bar , he notices that a beautiful woman has left her purse in a phone booth  
harry pockets her cash , only to have the woman reappear and catch him with her money in his pocket  
no problem , though  
the radiant blonde is rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue , ) the young wife of a very rich older man with heart problems , and she has a proposition for harry  
rhea needs "" a threatening voice and someone to collect the ransom "" for the staged kidnapping of her teenage stepdaughter odette ( chloe sevigny  ) 
the girls want to bilk a half-million dollar "" ransom "" from the old man and will happily give harry $50 , 000 for helping with the scam  
things go wrong , of course  
odette is found dead , leaving harry frantically trying to dispose of the corpse and cover his tracks  
in an ironic twist , harry is asked to work for the local d  a  's 
office  
they need a press liaison to field questions about odette's kidnapping and feel that harry is the perfect man for the job  
not a bad set-up for a noir film , if only schlondorff knew how to handle the material , but he never settles on a consistent tone  
the actors don't know what to do with their characters either , muddling the proceedings even further  
as if that wasn't enough , the story suffers from major problems in logic  
woody harrelson is a talented actor with an admirable willingness to take on risky parts , but he's lost here  
presented as a crusading journalist who was horribly wronged , it makes no sense that harry would be stupid and dishonest enough to get caught up in this scheme  
harrelson clearly doesn't know what to do with harry's character , so he spends most of the film glowering , sweating and generally acting miserable  
meanwhile , elisabeth shue gives a goofy performance , behaving like a vamp on nitrous oxide  
as the stepdaughter , chloe sevigny lays on so many slurpy quirks that she comes off like juliette lewis jr  despite a number of steamy scenes , there's no chemistry between harrelson and the women  
to make matters worse , schlondorff badly dubs in dialogue while the character's lips are running over each others bodies  
two particularly bad scenes highlight the film's problems  
while driving with a body in his trunk , harry has a minor car wreck and a cop shows up  
the officer wants to help change harry's flat tire and asks him to open the trunk  
harry's pathetic attempts to keep the trunk closed might have worked if played as comedy , but under schlondorff's grim direction , the scene is just embarrassing  
the film's nadir comes when a bad guy prepares to kill harry and nina  
we're supposed to be horrified watching our hero dangling over a bathtub filled with acid , but by this point the film has foundered so badly that the scene is merely reminiscent of when jessica and roger rabbit were suspended over a vat of dip "

-1,"i'm a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson's work  
he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain  
with teaching mrs  tingle , his directorial debut , williamson has reached the end of his rope  
what used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here  
the components are all there , including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to  
but where are the thrills ? 
the laughs ? 
both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge  
and what a shame that is  
i loved the scream films - heck , i even enjoyed the sci-fi goofiness of the faculty  
kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office  
teaching mrs  tingle , a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers , may put an end to his reign  
or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties  
i still have my faith , but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past  
the title character of his pet project is a vicious , uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over-the-top by british actress helen mirren  
mrs  tingle is basically every student's worst nightmare : a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard-working of her pupils  
the principal ( michael mckean ) is horrified of her , and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members  
i enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way  
mirren's performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink  
in other words , it's a poor substitute for williamson's best work  
the plot is a big problem here  
material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director  
the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann , an over-achiever hoping to get a college scholarship  
but typical mrs  tingle says her history project , which she worked on for countless hours , is laughable  
later on while studying in the gymnasium , a classmate ( barry watson ) offers her a photo-copied duplicate of mrs  tingle's final exam  
leigh ann's best friend ( marisa coughlan ) encourages her to use it  
alas , the old hag herself finds the three scheming , and snatches the test , and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning  
in the morning    
how convenient ! 
the three students head to mrs  tingle's house , attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann's name  
things get out of hand , and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle  
the plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her  
of course , not everything goes entirely to plan  
besides pointless sub-plots involving the football coach ( jeffrey tambor , horribly wasted ) , there is little by way of actual progress  
there is no urgency to the situation ; little tension or laughs are involved  
the humor is completely inconsistent  
after many of the jokes , the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze  
you continue to await some momentum in the story , something that could possibly revive the slow pace "

-1,"i went to blair witch project 2 : book of shadows with the highest of hopes  
the original film , released last summer , was genuinely scary and terrifying ; i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor  
unfortunately , my hopes were soon dashed  
as the movie opens , the audience is shown pseudo-documentary clips of burkittsville , maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie  
it's a mostly humorous , self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film  
during this segment , we are introduced to the protagonist , a young man who sells blair witch-related memorabilia from his website  
the movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously  
we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia , but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies  
we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him  
we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him  
no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution ; in fact , these scenes are barely referred to again  
i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally , a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting , filthy interiors , and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie  
the movie cuts again , this time to the present  
the young man , whose name is jeffrey ( played by jeffrey donovan -- as in the first movie , the character names are identical to the actors' names , although this movie admits up front that it is fictional , so there's no reason for the practice this time around ) , is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the "" blair witch hunt , "" which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website  
we meet tristen and steven , a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience  
steven is a skeptic , believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria  
tristen , on the other hand , believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence  
she is wan and soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly  
 ( she also complains that she feels nauseated ; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant , and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out  
how did i know ? 
because in bad movies , nauseated women are always pregnant  ) 
the fourth member of their party is erica , a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch , not evil  
they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery  
kim is dressed completely in black , has extreme goth-style makeup on , and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities , but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch  
presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; it's never explained  
the party of five heads off into the woods as promised  
they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr's house and set up camp , complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night's events  
there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well , but after a few words are exchanged , the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere  
the movie veers off at this point to spend many long , long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down  
sexual innuendoes are tossed around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consumed , and nothing much else happens  
this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary  
the next day , the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed , and that steven and tristen's manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds , like snow  
the videotapes are missing , but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim , they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house , "" right where the original blair witch tapes were found ! "" 
ooh  
spooky  
the team goes back to jeffrey's house -- a creepy old civil war-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and review the tapes  
they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night  
wacky hijinks ensue  
tristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch , everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on their bodies , steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations , and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket  
throughout the entire ordeal , jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes , which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps ; eventually tristen wanders in , mutters something about "" reverse , "" and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards  
when they do this , they discover what really happened during the five lost hours  
 ( one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes  
okay , if the videotapes were being buried , then how were they recording themselves   "

-1,"54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring  
a greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives , flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors  
i , however , would rather cut to the chase  
54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring  
there is nothing in it -- not a glimpse of depth , nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight  
there is no electricity in any of the scenes , or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots  
and it's underdeveloped , and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they're in this year's boogie nights  
they are so wrong  
the picture has been assembled by mark christopher  
based on this film , i don't know how he got a job in the business  
54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name , which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s  
i don't know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released , but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson's brilliant work in every possible way , from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography  
what it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great : depth , intelligence , energy , fascinating characters , and challenging themes  
54 can't even measure up to the last days of disco , which is flawed , but still smart and entertaining  
it's remarkably bad timing , i'd say , to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind  
i have exaggerated , though : there is one interesting character , and one terrific performance  
that character is steve rubell , played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves  
steve rubell is the owner of studio 54 , and if christopher had focused on him , then myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself  
alas , we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane ( ryan phillippe ) , a going-nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club , thanks to rubell's homosexual impulses  
it's here that he meets his friends , the array of uninteresting characters : his co-worker , greg ( brecklin meyer ) , his wife , anita ( salma hayek ) , and , of course , the love interest , julie black ( neve campbell )  
shane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning , and he has a reasonably sturdy home life  
 ( some of the scenes with his father border on interesting , while heather matarazzo , who plays his sister , pushes phillippe off the screen  ) 
but he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene , and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs  
why his "" friends "" push him into drugs is never really explained , but the fact that they are "" friends "" is questioned only is superficial ways ( greg gets really mad at shane because he's been elevated to bartender status )  
there isn't a single conflict that takes center stage , except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works  
most of the film is dumb , and most of the dialogue is inane  
there's a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black , and , in the next scene , they're arm-in-arm without a bit of development  
then , they're kissing in a bowling alley ! 
this is five minutes of material , thrown into the picture at the last minute ( well past the one-hour mark , and this isn't a long film to begin with )  
campbell is a talented actress , but she needs a role that gives her a little depth  
this one doesn't  
and phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever ; this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg's star-making role in boogie nights  
he seems dumb and misguided , and his voice never changes tone  
i guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body , but he seems pretty lanky to me  
he's all wrong for a lead role , but it doesn't help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters  
by the end of 54 , shane's most notable trait is his stupid , fake accent  
the rest of the performances are wasted  
hayek is an energetic , talented young actress , and does almost nothing here  
meyer is endearing , but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard  
only myers , by sheer force of talent , manages to rise above christopher's wading-pool of a script  
rubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters , but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance

that's when the kids of that time have jobs , disposable income and a desire to re-visit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives  
check out the prices of toys from the late sixties and you'll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks  
there's a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen  
boomers are now mostly in their forties and fifties and have lived in the work-a-day world for a long time  
they'd like to re-capture some of that fun they remember from days of yore  
hollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them  
directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that time  
and for the most part they're messing it up  
 "" mission impossible "" , "" lost in space "" , "" godzilla "" , "" zorro ""  
none of these successfully capture the originals  
none of these are even good films  
you can now add "" the avengers "" to the list  
the british television series began in 1961  
super secret agent john steed ( then-patrick macnee ) and his third partner , emma peel ( then-diana rigg ) are the pair that the american audience fell for  
surrealistic and witty , the series fit the mood of the times  
the leather-clad rigg probably didn't hurt the ratings either  
after all it's not a coincidence that you can't pronounce her character's name without "" appeal ""  
now we're in the nineties  
steed ( now-ralph fiennes ) and peel ( now-uma thurman ) are battling evil genius sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) who is screwing with england's weather  
that's about as much of a plot as we have  
there's some footage about a lot of other things that either don't make sense or make even less sense  
we get betrayal for some unknown reason  
evil clones appear and vanish and have no connection to the film  
remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason  
there's a high tech hot air balloon , but i have no idea why anyone's in it  
the spy agency is run by a man called "" mother "" who is in a wheelchair and a woman named "" father "" who is blind    at 
least in some scenes  
there's probably a reason for all of this , but we'll never know it  
macnee makes an appearance of sorts  
he is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing  
a group of villains sits around a table , all clad in huge pastel-colored teddy bear outfits  
at first it's humorous to watch the teddies waddle around , but then it becomes goofy  
the movie is a medley of clutter , confusion and wrong decisions around every corner  
it feels like major portions of the film are missing  
the storyline jumps rather than flows  
reportedly the film was re-cut several times  
this is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing  
there's one good point where peel is running from one room to another in a house designed by escher  
other than that , the effects are second-rate  
the weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes "

-1,"and i thought "" stigmata "" would be the worst religiously-oriented thriller released this year  
turns out i was wrong , because while "" stigmata "" was merely boring and self-important , "" end of days "" is completely inept on all fronts  
it's a silly , incomprehensible , endlessly stupid mess  
for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best , it's extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up  
for the first time in recent memory , an arnold action movie ( and "" batman & robin "" doesn't count ) is no fun at all  
 "" end of days "" is a major stinker  
the movie opens in vatican city , 1979  
some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy , which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation  
if he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 , 1999 , the world will be destroyed  
the pope orders protection of this girl , though some priests believe she ought to be killed  
in new york , that very night , a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy  
twenty years later , we meet jericho cane ( schwarzenegger ) , a suicidal ex-cop with a drinking problem  
now working as a security guard for hire , he is protecting a local businessman ( gabriel byrne ) , who is actually possessed by the devil  
an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after , christine york ( robin tunney )  
recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine ( including ownership of the same music box , apparently ) , jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her  
there are so many problems with this film it's hard to know where to begin , but how about starting with the concept ? 
casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with  
schwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea  
arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions  
in other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake  
harrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they've all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger  
there are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho's character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine's location by offering him his old life back  
none of these scenes really work , because arnie isn't up to the task  
the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before  
this one isn't at all believable the way arnold plays him  
the supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all  
as the prince of darkness , he's suave and confident  
he acts like one would expect the devil to act  
the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain  
byrne out-performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil  
byrne's speech about the bible being "" overrated "" actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold's attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the "" 'tis not ! "" 
variety ) are feeble at best  
the only problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares  
kevin pollack plays jericho's security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after about an hour  
robin tunney isn't given much to do except look scared  
in fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , save for byrne , is given anything interesting to do  
performances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it  
this being an action blockbuster , it's no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script , which starts off totally confusing , and when some of it is explained ( and not much of it is ) , it's utterly ridiculous  
why is the devil coming on new year's eve , 1999 ? 
because it's exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which isn't 666 , it turns out  
some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the beginning , and you've got 1999 ! 
if you don't buy this explanation , you're not alone  
it's convoluted and silly at the same time  
the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous ( she's christine , see , and she lives in new york , see  
  
  ) , and if that weren't bad enough , there's plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn't explained at all "

-1,"when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects  
while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don't think that they are completely to blame for this movie's failure  
it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the "" unseen "" terrors , and it was about as scary as a dust bunny  
so special effects or not , if the story isn't the least bit scary , you aren't going to end up with a very frightening movie  
the thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern  
dern is always great , and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie  
as i sat through the seemingly endless , albeit fairly impressive , special effects , i kept wishing that this movie was about dern's caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast  
never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie  
liam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear  
he decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion  
he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia  
and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings-on  
catherine zeta-jones , lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects  
like the original , taylor's character is the star of the movie  
but since she doesn't quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms  zeta-jones , their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original  
and let's face it , probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta-jones  
i'll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren't in it  
but the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets  
they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients  
there really isn't much of a story here  
just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with  
and the special effects are great  
in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere  
in other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the "" cool shots "" quota  
at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary -- funny , maybe  
but not scary  
then we have the set  
when i first saw the house , i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it  
but it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did , and decided to take the idiotically overdone route  
this included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves  
what part did these rooms play in the story ? 
absolutely none  
they were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie  
then we have the actors  
lili taylor has never been one of my favorites  
and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in , she comes in around the average or slightly below mark  
i have no idea why liam neeson took this role  
he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus  
his character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him  
i have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman  
zeta-jones was cast because she is too hot for words  
the fact that her character is bi-sexual is just icing on the cake  
all catherine has to do in this movie is look good "
-1,"capsule : annoyingly unentertaining , obvious and paper-thin buddy/cop/drug/sexy-witness movie  
presence of director michael bay shows none of the talent he demonstrated in the rock  
i've seen this movie already , i said , as i looked at the box art  
no , i haven't even seen a trailer for the movie ; i don't even know what it's about , but i can look at the way they're promoting it , and i know i've seen it already  
i thought : it's about these two cops  
and they're buddies , sort of  
they're at each other's throats a lot , but they really do like each other  
and everyone else in their department hates them 'cause they're hot-shots  
and they have some kind of diametric opposition in their relationship  
and one day they're in the middle of cop business as usual when they get mixed up in this plot that involves a really sadistic bad guy with lots of henchmen who can never hit anything with the billions of rounds of ammo they are always carrying  
and the bad guy is a drug lord  
and there's a witness , and she's this sexy thing who rubs both of them the wrong way  
and their supervisor wants their badges for breakfast when they blow up half the town bringing this guy down  
i only missed the bit about the badges  
the rest i got dead-on  
and i hadn't even left the video store yet  
the cops in this movie are will smith and martin lawrence , and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo  
smith plays a cop who has a trust fund and is thus not a cop for the money ; martin l  is a family man ( shades of the now-tired lethal weapon dynamic here ) whose wife and he are at total odds  
this leads to some strained scenes about lawrence's "" not getting any "" , and some totally unneccesary bits with him skulking around his own house , thinking his partner is now his wife's "" back door man ""  
not funny ; tiresome  
bad boys gets some of its incredibly meager selling points from the presence of will smith and martin lawrence  
will smith is a natural , and i'm happy to see him in movies like six degrees    
and men in black  
he's funny and charming without trying to be ; he really does seem to be enjoying himself  
martin lawrence is a different story ; he's so uptight and verbally constipated that sitting through his improvised riffs are a trial  
movies like this are not about originality  
i know this  
they are about style and energy and synergy between actors  
i know this , too  
and yet , while watching bad boys , which its glamorous photography and impossibly exact stunt choreography , i felt fed up  
i'd seen con air , which despite being completely implausible , was still great fun , because it tried however feebly to put some new life into the mix  
bad boys is a dry run -- and overlong , too , clocking in at just over two hours with a lot more by-play than i felt could be justified  
i could write this movie  
you could write this movie  
many people have  
many people will continue to write this movie , over and over again  
other people will buy it from them , and make it , and we will pay money to see it

-1,"i'll be the first to admit it  
when you mention the book great expectations , i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class , where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch  
yes , it's a classic of literature , but it was a rather dry one , shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine  
certainly , the experience wasn't truly that bad , but , to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book , "" i'm not going to tell the story the way it happened    i'll 
gonna tell it the way i remember it  "" 
anyway , to return from nostalgia lane , and get back to the present , hollywood , in it's trendy attempt to modernize the classics , now presents an updated film version of great expectations  
instead of pip , this time the central character is named finn ( played as a boy by jeremy kissner , and by ethan hawke as an adult )  
finn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie , or should that be mrs  joe , ( kim dickens ) , and her boorish fisherman husband , joe ( chris cooper )  
the setting is the florida coast during the mid-70s  
finn is a blooming artist , and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish ( one of his two favorite subjects )  
during one of these escapades , he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal ( robert deniro )  
borrowing a page from the superhuman max cady , deniro's criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity , and favors hiding on the ocean floor  
ok    maybe 
that's an exaggeration , but he certainly beats any of houdini's records in the opening scenes of the film  
and that's nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finn's motorboat , but i digress  
anyway , finn does the convict a good deed , just to show that he's a really swell guy  
and then the plot moves on  
enter miss havisham    or 
ms  dinsmoor here ( anne bancroft )  
abandoned at the altar some 26 years ago , ms  dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid  
with bizarre clothing , eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup , anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role  
although she ends up nowhere near a believable character , she does add some humor to the film  
joe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner , but the insane ms  dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece , estella ( raquel beaudene as a young girl , gwyneth paltrow as an adult )  
for no apparent reason , other than to provide the main plot of the film , finn is instantly stricken for the estella  
perhaps it's her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person , or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before  
in any case , neither as children nor adults , chemistry simply doesn't exist between the two , and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her  
even when , as an adult , finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor , reacquaints himself with estella , and draws her portrait in the nude , there's nothing  
in fact , there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnear's gay artist during a similar scene in as good as it gets  
at this point , the audience has grown as cold and detached as estella's character , and couldn't care less about the two characters  
the bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow  
she fails to imbue estella , a remote character in the book , with even the vaguest traces of humanity  
there's obviously something wrong when , watching the film , you're more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character  
without a strong estella , finn's obsession seems baseless "

it's up to wayne and j  d  to rescue their best friend in "" saving silverman  ""

the pair is able to elicit the film's only laughs with their goofy antics and child-like behavior  
they are relegated to providing slapstick guy humor and the two are more than equal to the task  
steve zahn has been steadily honing his comedic acting skills and gives some complexity to wayne , the "" brains "" of the gang

-1,"the following review encompasses two versions of dune : 
dune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book  
the film's visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative  
dune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television  
it was disowned by director david lynch but it's considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline  
quality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web  
 * * * the review * * * 
released in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert's cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans  
director david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico  
the screenplay was lynch's own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected  
dune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors  
the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that's home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange  
the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe  
it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it  
most importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to "" fold space "" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish  
lynch's film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story's two main strands  
one is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis  
the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen  
the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom  
unfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended  
the thinking among universal's oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office  
with lynch's initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made  
what a great idea ! 
why not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ? 
the most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters  
thus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul's father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless  
the end result is a distinct chill : we can't warm to most of the cast and we don't care much for them  
and it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book  
dune is also a very serous film  
the constant "" self-talk "" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment  
the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them  
humour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen's mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find  
you may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus' star wars trilogy  
the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however  
it still possesses enough of lynch's stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi  
special effects whiz carlo rambaldi's giant sandworms are an awesome sight  
both the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original  
and the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years  
with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses  
see it in the widescreen format if you can  
and despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen  
sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who's secret aim is to manipulate paul's destiny for its own shadowy ends  
as paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade  
the conclusion ? 
any assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert's original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker  
david lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects  
dune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release  
many chose to stay away altogether , as the film's disastrous box office showing attests "
-1,"capsule : an insult  
a stupid and incompetent movie that doesn't even have the benefit of being trashily enjoyable  
weslely and woody would do well to leave this off their resumes  
money train is one of the worst movies i have ever seen  
it's not simply idiotic , it's contemptuous of its audience  
it tries to make us swallow things that a better movie would be stopped cold by or just plain omit entirely  
it's a waste of wesley snipes and woody harrelson , who are enjoyable actors in their own rights but are nauseating here  
it's not even fun as trash  
woody and wesley star ( maybe that's not the right word ) as new york city transit authority police  
they have a job which could actually be the core of a really interesting movie : one of them plays drunk possum to attract chain-snatchers and the other does lookout  
i had a whole headful of legal and ethical questions surrounding this , raised by a documentary i'd seen on the subject once , but the movie does not waste any time with being intelligent or thought-provoking  
see if you can follow this  
they chase a kid down the tunnel and into the station where the "" money train "" , the heavily armored car that picks up all the cash from the token books , is parked  
the guards on the train see this kid running at them , lift their machine guns , shout "" halt ! "" 
and then open fire when the kid doesn't stop running at them  
blam , the kid's dead  
then woody and wesley show up , and of course the other ta cops hate them ( why ? ) , and a pushing match starts , and someone gets decked , and    i covered my face  
i'd seen enough  
i've never seen a movie work so hard and in so little time to destroy , systematically , any chance of being credible or interesting  
fed up with the bs at their job ( most of it their own goddamned fault ) , woody and wesley hatch this plot about how to rob the money train  
hence the title , in case some of you ( all two of you ) didn't figure it out yet  
then there's this subplot about a maniac who torches token book clerks , * and * a love story , * and * a holdup -- no , two holdups , sorry , easy to lose track in a movie this braindead -- * and * a mob boss who wants his money  
there wasn't a minute when i gave a horse's ass about any of it  
neither woody nor wesley play characters that are interesting for a single minute  
we do not care about them  
they are not interesting  
they are noisy , loud , stupid , foolish jerks who whould have flunked out of the police academy  
they deserve to get shot -- or run over , as the case may be  
they only exist to rehash the kind of dynamics that was * written * into a movie like white men can't jump , and which simply does not exist here  
they are idiots , and we're expected to root for them  
bullcrap  
the movie is completely schizophrenic in its tone and texture  
what exactly is this mess ? 
a cop movie ? 
police procedure is not given a moment's genuine thought anywhere  
a thriller ? 
the subplot with the token booth killer is inept , a throwaway that should have been ditched in the rewrite  
a comedy ? 
the few jokes that do work are wasted  
a drama ? 
all dramatic tension between both principals is freeze-dried and off-the-rack  
there's not a moment in the movie where i felt like i was listening to genuine human beings talk ; it's all screenwriterese , that bizarre analect where every sentence ends in a punchline and the primary mode of expression is the unique conjunctions of four-letter words  
 ( actual dialogue excerpt : "" fuck you  "" 
 "" what ? "" 
 "" you heard me : fuck * you *  "" 
 "" no : fuck * you * ! "" ) 
look  i'll be honest here "

-1,"actually , i'm fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie  
 "" baywatch "" babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her double-d's on the small screen  
at least there you don't have to pay to see her cleavage  
and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless , hate to burst your bubble , but there are no full-fledged nude scenes in barb wire  
you wouldn't be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in  
i can't go back in time and reverse my mistake , but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there  
they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude , it's so quick you can't even tell for sure whether you're seeing her andersons or not  
a nipple hallucination sort of thing  
barb wire was adapted from a comic book , interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life , even wearing low-cut leather to do office work ( businesswoman bondage wear ) and having unreal body proportions  
yes , like the mona lisa , pamela anderson is a man-made beauty , probably in more senses than one  
she is a definite beauty , though , and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience  
you'd just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn't have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie , because it's obvious she wasn't pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills  
i mean , she shows off more cleavage here than a jeweler's convention  
the movie is set in the year 2017 , "" the worst year of my life , "" pam says  
 ( "" the worst movie of the year , "" i say  ) 
america is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation ( silicone valley , i think )  
she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right , posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute  
but don't call her "" babe  "" 
she hates that , and reminds us of that fact way too many times  
imagine , a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred to in such a sexist , demeaning term  
a liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldn't have to hear words like "" babe "" during a strip tease , especially since that movie about the talking pig was such a success  
the plot ( ha-ha ) revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorate's retina scanners  
in the words of one of the characters , they're "" more than meets the eye  "" 
reminds me of the "" transformers "" cartoon , and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent , but that never happened  
no , the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela van-damme , big-busted kickboxer , and her resistance accomplices , ex-boyfriend axel ( tamuera morrison ) and cora ( victoria rowell )  
thank god they didn't name her cora reef  
one bad character name is more than enough  
pamela originally doesn't take sides , giving some speech about she's only loyal to the money they pay her , but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother , jack noseworthy of bon jovi "" always "" video fame  
i still don't know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy , but he definitely is nose worthy ( even if he isn't sponge worthy )  
pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi-automatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest  
it's not rambo    
it's bimbo ! 
mark my words , barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in a year  
it's got all the elements of the direct-to-video releases featured on hbo's bastard cousin , the cable channel i'd never watch if it didn't somehow come free  
it's got the non-titillating scenes of voyeurism , laughable flashbacks , bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo  
there's even a narrator at the beginning setting up the movie's premise while the words scroll up the screen  
someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this ain't star wars  
if you've seen any action flick of the past fifteen years , you'll recognize plenty of lifted elements  
barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over , car crashes , explosions , broken glass and slow-motion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death  
this is one of those automatic-pilot movies anyone could write or direct  
barb wire has only two things going for it  "

he vows revenge on that man and is taught the ways of the musketeer by some old dude who used to be one himself ? 
anyway , fourteen years go by and    arrgh , well , you know the rest    swish-swish-zzzzzzz ! 
critique : this is a pretty bad movie  
let's see , where should i start ? 
okay , first of all , the story is just plain boring  
it's not original , is entirely predictable and lacks energy  
okay , what's next ? 
acting , you say  
hmmmm , well , the main actor , justin chambers , is basically an uncharismatic version of chris o'donnell but with less range ( think about that ! ) , and mena suvari , is just plain off  
not as bad as thora birch was in dungeons & dragons , but entirely miscast , with bad deliveries , awful sequences and a piss-poor accent that comes and goes  
now i'm not sure if this was ms  suvari's fault or the director's , but i've definitely seen her at a much higher level than in this film  
the only semi-saving grace actor-wise is tim roth as the irrepressible "" bad guy "" , but once again , it's not something that we haven't seen before    a

tim , please    for the love of god , beg your agent to ask the marketplace for some modern day "" american roles "" for you as a "" nice guy "" in a romantic comedy or something

we all know that you can do much better than this gunk  
alright , what else was bad in this film ? 
oh yeah , the score ! 
yikes , how's about taking it down a few notches there , fellas ? 
this thing blares in your ear whenever it feels the need to accentuate a certain scene , but actually does little more than annoy  
i think it's important for the man behind the music to recognize that this film isn't a "" real epic "" by any stretch of the imagination  
it's a fluffy rehashed cake-walk created by some "" shrewd "" studio heads who decided to take advantage of the whole "" kung-fu "" phenomenon in films , and test it out on an old classic

the editing is also pretty shoddy in this movie , the dialogue banal and stilted and the plot problems    plentiful ! 
 ( why does the guy on top of the horse carriage just stand there when his opponent takes forever scampering his way back to the top ?

sphere a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman 
one of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents  
you keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered  
psychologist norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of a plane crash  
when he arrives at the site , he discovers that there is no plane , but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting 1 , 000 feet below the surface for almost 300 years  
having written a paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact , he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship  
his group as outlined in his report , consists of beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist ; harry adams ( samuel l  jackson ) , a mathematician ; and ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist  
unfortunately it turns out that the writing was a blow-off project for goodman who did it for the money and named his then-colleagues to the team  
 "" after all , "" he explains , "" who reads government documents ? "" 
lead by harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , a top secret federal operative , the group descends to a mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel  
once there they stroll over , knock on the door and explore the still-operational ufo  
discovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere  
when adams enters the sphere , the weirdness unfolds  
a storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer  
 "" my name is jerry  
i am happy "" flashes across the screen  
this is unsettling for the psychologist  
 "" what happens if jerry gets mad ? "" he asks  
barnes is more pragmatic : he needs a last name because he can't put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry  
then the situation turns bad  
deadly beasts appear from nowhere  
a gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel  
lethal sea snakes attack goodman  
a giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading "" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea ""  
the suspicious scientists turn against each other  
this has all the makings of a first-rate thinking man's science fiction film  
however even the finest ingredients don't go very far in the hands of a chief who doesn't seem to care about his product  
director barry levinson has churned out a mish-mosh that doesn't engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes  
the first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification  
it's much like speed-reading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances  
it doesn't get any better when the action scenes begin  
while the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles , the people are still flat  
oddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them  
after adams experiences the interior of the sphere , no one bothers to ask him what happened  
their history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited  
even goodman and halperin's ill-conceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing  
her psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing  
there's a truism that items shown early in a movie must be used before the ending , but here they are far too obvious  
when an emergency mini-sub is explained , you know what's going to happen  
the movie affectations are nothing more than distracting  
chapter headings that divide the movie have no function  
the shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos  
much of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow  
although some of the disorientation eventually is understandable , a great deal of it isn't "

-1,"synopsis : sullen julie james , still haunted by nightmares of the killer ben willis from i know what you did last summer , perks up when her new best friend karla wilson wins a trip for four to the bahamas  
arriving at the start of the hurricane season , julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize they've walked into a trap set by the rainslickered slasher with a huge hook for a hand  
comments : i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here , but i have never seen an episode of the fox tv series "" party of five  "" 
i am only vaguely aware of the show's premise , and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i half-paid attention to while watching the tube  
 "" party of five , "" i do know however , seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre  
neve campbell , scream queen of the 90s and star of scream , scream 2 , and the craft , is a regular of the show  
so too is jennifer love hewitt  
lo and behold , following in the footsteps of campbell , hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own : the i know what you did last summer line  
though the original film , released last year , was watchable enough , this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater's glowing red exit sign longingly throughout  
jennifer love hewitt is a very good-looking young leading lady ; however , unlike neve campbell , hewitt struggles with acting  
she just isn't convincing in this film ( and she wasn't in the original either )  
this puts many young males , including myself , in a paradoxical quandary : she's very attractive , but the annoying , spoiled , valley girl-type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize , exploitatively , her figure  
add to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy , another rising teen tv star , and you get one frustrated male audience  
i've spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for a reason  
i still know what you did last summer , though cashing in on the success of the original , ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses  
nothing else here is original or interesting  
this movie , in fact , makes other recent so-so horror films like urban legend and john carpenter's vampires seem like stunning works of high art  
i still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches : an isolated location , a storm , parentless teenagers , false alarm nightmares , lots of blue-lighted darkness scenes , a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him , knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere , etc  you get the picture  
the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killer's hook  
they may as well have huge targets painted on them  
like scream and its numerous knockoffs , these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief  
unfortunately , i still know's characters aren't all that funny  
in particular , one character , a chain-weed-smoking guy , is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesn't die soon enough  
the death scenes , by the way , are relatively violent for a theatrically released horror film  
several of them are uncomfortable to watch , and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser : bloodline , a truly sadistic movie  
this , too , did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for  
and what is the deal with the slasher himself ? 
i know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre , but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror  
come on , the guy looks like the gorton's fisherman , and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate  
though his lightning-lit appearances ellicited much-needed laughter in the theater , his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film , and that's * really * saying something  
so , all that's left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy  
both prance about in tightfitting , revealing outfits or in various states of undress , yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene  
hewitt , however , does do a post-shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite  
  
  titillating  
this scene alone made this one-star turkey earn two stars under my rating system  
otherwise , hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves  
early in the film , for instance , brandy wins the trip to the bahamas  
she and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever  
i needed extra-strength tylenol after that part  
oh , and the film's conclusion , talk about repetitive ! 
people who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still know's ending at least 5 minutes before it happens  
boring ! 
i saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater "

-1,"like a good action film should , "" metro "" has action that keeps you involved  
some action films have action sequences that are so conventional , our attention is detracted and diverted by other thoughts  
 "" the ghost in the darkness , "" which opened a few months ago , is a film that s action was so bland and uninvolving , it not only invited my thoughts to divert me , it nearly put me asleep  
but "" metro "" is one of the best action films in a while  
it is hip , sharp , nifty , and has nice little pieces of suspense and comedy  
eddie murphy was in bad shape for a while  
and this invites me to mention last year s "" the nutty professor , "" which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be  
 "" metro "" happens to be a lot better than any film in the "" beverly hills cop "" series  
that is because "" metro "" takes itself seriously , but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun  
eddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible , and controlled people  
the "" beverly hills cop "" movies all featured eddie as a reckless , wild cop , always crossing the line by just an inch  
in "" metro "" he plays a hostage negotiator , so negotiation is his job , not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble  
his character in "" metro "" takes himself seriously  
eddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in "" metro , "" and perhaps it is quite better off that way  
murphy plays scott roper , and as i previously mentioned , he is a san francisco hostage negotiator  
in the first tense situation in the film , we are introduced to roper s kind of work , as he tries to calm down a confused , unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up  
murphy handles the scene seriously , without his usual happy-go-lucky , misfit humor  
the film develops when its villain is established , and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda , a jewel thief , and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim  
 "" metro "" takes different twists and slight turns , and there is one great , virtuoso chase scene , involving the a cable car  
cars flip  
cars crash  
cars turn over  
and it is done so good in this film , i was reminded of "" speed , "" and the speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons  
there are also some other good scenes in "" metro "" that a lot of films would rather choose not to have  
scenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning  
of course , the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling  
the scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice , too  
those are the scenes that make up "" metro , "" which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality  
the actor that i most enjoyed seeing in "" metro "" was michael rapaport , who plays roper s new partner , a lip-reading , book-skimming genius , and a master of observation  
it was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius  
rapaport is an actor who i usually see in the role of the dimwit the really , really dopey dimwit  
i hardly recognized him in "" metro , "" and it was quite a joy to be able to see him in a role like this i feel that i respect him more  
there are two main types of villains in movies like this : the ones that are part of the story , and the ones that are devices  
the villain in "" metro "" is no more than a device , but he is a darn good villain nonetheless  
he is played by michael wincott , whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp , as if he smokes a cigarette between every take  
wincott makes his villain , korda , as mean as could be , the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks , like richard widmark in "" kiss of death  "" 
and , in addition , wincott s physical appearance and mannerisms , in the film , actually reminded my of an arrogant friend i use to have , who is no longer on my good list  
i liked "" metro , "" and i do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy  
his past roles were the great ones but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later take place , possibly from murphy s growing as a person , now having a family  
 "" metro "" is a no-nonsense movie  
it works as a buddy movie , which it does not overplay  
it works as a dry comedy , which it does not overplay  
it works as a suspense film , which it does not overplay "

starring lee kang-sheng , yang kuei-mei directed by tsai ming-liang written by tsai and yang ping-ying cinematography by liao peng-jung 
taiwan , 24/12/99  
the millenium approaches  
an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city  
sectors of the city are being sealed , quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus  
the virus causes people to act like insects : they crawl about on all fours , hide from bright lights , huddle in damp corners  
the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a week's time  
residents are advised to evacuate the area , asap  
this premise--kafka by way of cronenberg--is the background for the hole , which could have been a great movie , but , sadly , ends up as a waste of good ideas  
the quick sketch above suggests a dark , absurd , hallucinatory near-future parable of life in the late 20th century ; in execution , however , it is nothing like that  
the virus , the evacuation , the visual possiblities of the deluge : these are all relegated to the background  
instead , the hole focuses on the lives--for want of a better word--of a man ( lee kang-sheng ) and a woman ( yang kuei-mei ) who live in the same apartment building , and who have no personalities  
the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile : the charmless rooms and corridors of a post-industrial apartment complex , photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible  
it's a vivid setting , but an unappealing one , especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background  
the man lives in the apartment directly above the woman's  
one day , a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of the man's living room , opening into the ceiling of the woman's living room  
this hole--symbol of the solitary opening in the character's lonely , compartmented lives--allows them to interact in unusual ( and mostly non-verbal ) ways  
example : the man , suffering from the onset of the virus ( or so i assume--everything is obscure in this movie ) vomits through the hole  
the woman , wandering around in the dark , accidentally puts her hand on his vomit , and then cleans it up  
this is what passes for meaningful communication  
and they say romance is dead  
much of the film does not even focus on their interactions , such as they are  
there is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people  
they are ciphers  
instead , we are treated to long takes in which we witness their miserable lives ; we watch , for instance , as the woman boils some water , pours it onto some noodles , then eats the noodles  
 ( this is as fascinating as it sounds  ) 
offered as counterpoint--or perhaps relief--to these dreary sequences are a series of musical numbers , fantasies in which the woman lip-synchs to pop songs by grace chan ( popular , so i'm told , in 1950s' china )  
she prances around in grimy hallways and grungy stairwells , incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights  
sometimes , in these fantasies , she is joined by the man  
these scenes are presumably intended to be bright and fanciful , sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality , but they fail  
when the man and the woman dance , it seems half-hearted and listless  
astaire and rogers this is not  
even in imagination , these people are numb , weary , boring  
the hole is part of the 'collection 2000' series , a group of films commissioned by french tv station la sept arte on the subject of the millenium  
others include canada's last night , brazil's midnight , and american hal hartley's the book of life  
the book of life is the only other one that i have seen , and it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry  
witty , energetic , humane , it makes the the hole seem ( ahem ) empty  
american movies with nothing to say try to disguise their lack of content with flashy movements , quick cuts , superficial emotions  
foreign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does : they point the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time , and call it art  
the hole is self-evidently a film about alienation , and perhaps director tsai ming-liang wants the audience to share in his characters' alienation  
if so , he succeeds  
perhaps it is a challenge : he dares us to enjoy this movie , despite his best attempts to ensure that we don't  
if it was a challenge , i wasn't up for it "

it appears the twenty-eight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder , and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired  
she learns that her problems are related , as the owner of her advertising agency , mr  mercer ( kevin dunn ) , explains to her that her single status does not bode well with the company  
her freedom would make her more likely to leave the company , taking clients with her  
a solution presents itself in nick ( jay mohr ) , a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coincidence and gets photographed with  
kate's boss , darcy ( illeana douglas ) , uses the photograph to fabricate a wedding engagement between kate and nick  
kate is at first repulsed by the idea , but after getting immediate positive results , she pursues it  
her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan  
the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc ?  
at a dinner with kate's bosses he will provoke a fight and they will break up  
she meets nick to propose the plan  
he accepts  
kate's new status brings unexpected results in other areas

now that she is engaged , he pursues an affair with her , as doing so would destroy her good girl image , hence sam's sudden interest  
things start to fall apart for kate , as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her , and does not wish to break up with her  
after some provoking nick does oblige , but problems continue for kate  
it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available  
or maybe kate does like nick , but "" reconciliation "" will force her to admit her lies to her employer  
adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother ( olympia dukakis ) , who wants her to get married and settle down  
there is a scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is ( from the waist up ) only wearing a bra  
it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one  
there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer  
it's like the director said 'well , we know the story is formulaic and the performances aren't that great so , what the heck , let's show jennifer's assets as often and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating  "" 
quite frankly it's insulting  
i don't think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie  
she did a decent enough job in ed burns' "" she's the one "" because it was a smaller and supporting role , and she just doesn't deliver the goods effectively in this movie  
her performance was not convincing  
unfortunately , as far as romantic comedies go , this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies  
the film is similar to "" my best friends wedding "" in a sense that the leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her actions , gets no sympathy from me when things go awry  
i didn't care for how quickly kate puts down nick's profession by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn't glamorous enough for her co-workers  
at least "" my best friends wedding "" changed the formula a bit and had a somewhat surprise ending  
no such luck with "" picture perfect ""  
every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away , including a couple that really made no sense  
after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company , why would she blindly throw it all away when she should have made sure that nick would even talk to her first , let alone consider a relationship ? 
was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick ? 
throw in the fact that i don't think nick and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of a decision  
i believe that kate liked him , but liked him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away ? 
i doubt it  
and what of the ending scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the couple ? 
are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers ? 
well , i guess of the congregation consists of movie extras and the strangers are the movies two lead stars , then that would make sense

-1,"this review contains spoilers , but believe me , i don't say anything you can't guess 10 minutes into the movie  
i * did * go into this one with high expectations  
i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks  
i sort of expected another exorcist or the shining  
i even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film  
boy , was i wrong ! 
another garbage slasher flick , the only difference being that * this * one has a story ! 
the story , you ask ? 
well , a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk  
he takes it home , somehow getting it past customs : - ) and starts fiddling with it in his attic  
lo and behold , after he takes it apart , three demons appear and start taking him apart , but with meat hooks  
when they're finished , his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling  
they botch up their cleanup job , however , and manage to leave his heart ( or some gland ; i didn't really recognize the organ ) under a floorboard  
the guy's brother and his brother's wife appear at the door soon after , and decide to move in  
they throw away scumball's belongings , and set up house  
turns out that wife is a bit of a nympho , and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage  
she starts having some wild hallucinations  
later , hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards ( slow-mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground--all from the tiny cut on his hand )  
said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumball's organ  
the organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing  
it establishes mind contact with wife , who agrees to help him get more blood , because she really wants to be screwed again  
so , she helps him kill three businessmen  
scumball , at this time , gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back  
problem is , he doesn't have any skin , and even after three or four corpses , still doesn't get any skin  
he finally gets some , though , but strangely enough , he ends up looking like his brother  
guess they couldn't get the original actor back  
who knows  
scumball ( whose name is frank ) is not a nice guy  
he describes his torture by the demons fondly , as the "" ultimate pleasure and pain , since at that level there is no difference between the two  "" 
somehow , i don't see getting torn apart by 90 fish- and meat-hooks a lot of fun  
this guy is * so * bad ( "" how bad * is * he ? "" ) , 
 * so * bad that the * rats * cower in a corner in fear  
for good reason , too ; he crucifies two of them for fun , and carves a third while the nympho's horsing around with hubby  
anyway  hubby's daughter ( who , if course , is not * wife's * daughter ) starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams  
the dumb bimbo meets scumball , and is not impressed  
she manages to escape with the chinese puzzle , and brings out the demons  
at any rate , the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup ; they're normally quite meticulous about that type of thing  
the story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake  
the demons are not , however , the good guys  
the dumb bimbo's the good guy  
she somehow not only gets them to take care of frank , but also banishes them to hell or oblivion , we're not too sure which  
not too shabby for someone with single-digit iq  
this is basically a "" bad jinn "" story  
it is an * awful * movie  
awful acting , bad focus in the photography , many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks , which is really unrealistic , and looks like the latex that it is  
continuity ? 
who cares "

that's what we do ! "" 
--- dr  alexander mccabe ( bob gunton ) , in response to why he created evil bats  
alright folks , stop me if you've heard this one : genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals , assisted by a specialist in the particular animal's field , must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth  
oh yeah , the military is on their way to bomb the town as well , so they are running short on time  
sound familiar ? 
such is the plot of the destination films release of bats  
dina meyer stars as the "" bat specialist "" sheila , who is pulled from her research ( along with her annoying sidekick , played with irritating deftness by leon ) in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently  
with the help of the local sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) , a cdc official ( carlos jacott ) , and a scientist ( bob gunton ) , sheila discovers it is indeed bats ( who have been genetically altered by gunton's character to be more aggressive and omnivorous , in order to be used as a military weapon ! )  
i have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film  
there's not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good  
in this respect , the film never disappointed me  
this film reaches a level that transcends the "" so bad it's good "" level and borders on the downright insane  
the effects are awful , the script is contrived , and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously ( i think )  
i challenge anyone to sit through the scene , where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner , with a straight face  
thankfully , the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with  
dina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in ( johnny mnemonic , dragonheart , and starship troopers    
the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit ) , and this one is no exception  
while one never really gets the impression that meyer's character could be a bat expert in reality , one never really cares to doubt it either  
she gives as good a performance as could be expected , plus she's nice to look at for an hour and a half  
lou diamond phillips is also serviceable here , as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero  
although when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what's going on in town , for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats  
the only bad performance in the film is that of leon's  
he is relegated to the "" i'm not sticking around here ! "" 
character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays  
anyone who can't immediately tell that bob gunton ( the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films ) is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised , but i highly doubt it  
even if he hadn't been the villain in just about every film he's ever been in , so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever  
in fact , his death is welcome , because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale  
if the plot doesn't sound ridiculous to you yet , then check out these little tidbits : a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol  
an entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor's orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated , causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force , killing several townsfolk  
a government official blows off shelia's instructions ( to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats' cave that will kill all of them off ) by pulling a night job , resulting in the death of an entire military unit  
a cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it  
finally , to top it all off , this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it's single screen theater ( for reference , our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens , and we're lucky to even get kevin smith's dogma )  
the most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill-conceived bat puppets  
while the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing ( making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what's going on ) , the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more low-key  
therefore we the audience get loving close-ups of the most unrealistic , rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film  
being able to see the puppeteer's arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse  
after all of this , if you still decide bats might be the movie for you , don't say you haven't been warned  
trust me when i say that it's a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through  
i just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in "

-1,"writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard  
harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun  
harder than building a bridge over troubled waters  
and incidentally , a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review  
thrillers are all variations on a theme  
you have a smart , resourceful , and powerful bad guy , who has a goal he has to meet  
you have a noble and brave good guy , who has to protect the innocent , kill the bad guy , and not get killed himself in the process  
the trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner  
this simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest , high noon , or silence of the lambs , or big summer blockbusters like men in black , the fugitive , or air force one , or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds , event horizon , kull the conqueror     
is anyone else getting depressed here ? 
point is , it's not enough to follow the formula  
you've got to throw in something extra , something good and new and better than the last version  
something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals  
this is a hard thing to do , but it is absolutely necessary in every way  
without that something extra -- whether it's a great plot or a well-written screenplay , or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs -- the movie fails  
that's why the jackal , with all its starpower , with all its budget , with all its hype , gets a big fat f  
bruce willis is the bad guy , the jackal , a legendary killer for hire  
richard gere is the good guy , a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal  
the jackal is trying to kill someone  
gere is trying to stop him  
will gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal ? 
 ( i'll give you three guesses , and the first two don't count  ) 
there are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal , no moment when you say to yourself , "" i wonder what happens next ? "" 
the script for the jackal isn't ripped straight from today's headlines  
it's ripped off , straight from an episode of millennium  
throughout the movie , we learn what the jackal's plans are and how he intends to accomplish them  
no surprise  
the fun of a movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackal's plan is and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy  
instead , we get two ( count 'em , two ) scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackal's plan just as if he's frank black ( or more likely , just as if he's been handed a copy of the script )  
and we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight  
it's like gere's character is psychic , but neither he nor the fbi ( or the screenwriters ) seem to know it  
and just like in millennium , the bad guy has an overwhelming need to go after the people the good guy cares about , whether or not they are important to what he's trying to do or not  
what's more , in the last half of the movie , the jackal , supposedly a super-smart professional terrorist who never makes a mistake , comes down with a major case of the stupids  
as for the performances    
bruce willis manages to get through the whole movie without a wisecrack , which is a major achievement , but not enough reason to see the movie  
his disguises are good , but not as good or as interesting as val kilmer's in the saint  
richard gere is made to talk the entire movie in an irish accent , which detracts from his otherwise lifeless and dull performance  
sidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie -- not that his performance is bad or anything , it's not , but it is sad that hollywood won't use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent ( shoot to kill , sneakers )  
writing a good plot and a good screenplay , like i said , is hard , but it can be done  
it wasn't done here  
it is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays and to denounce bad and uninteresting ones "

-1,"i read the new yorker magazine and i enjoy some of their really in-depth articles about some incident  
they will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail  
it becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested , and what kind of pressure the investigators are under , and just about any other aspect you can think of  
frequently i get the feeling that the article sounded exciting , but i am being told in more detail than i really wanted to know  
often i get to the middle of a story and say , ok , it sounded good but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject  
film is a different medium  
it is a visual medium  
that slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize  
i frequently am surprised to find out how short a film script is and how much of the pages are empty space  
the magazine article and the film script are two very different media  
the insider is a film adaptation of the vanity fair article "" the man who knew too much "" by marie brenner  
it is too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film  
it really verges on being tedious at least at times  
for years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy side-effects  
but they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it  
the business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco  
the tide turned when a former vice-president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking  
the resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at cbs  
who were the major people involved , what were their motives , how was the story almost killed , how did it get aired anyway ? 
that is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider  
this all could have been enthralling , but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well  
and in the end , he failed  
to make a long story short , the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short  
the film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist  
we get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand  
they go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace ( played by christopher plummer )  
there the news team under producer lowell bergman ( al pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it  
this seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story , but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists , we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world  
terrorists can grab the headlines , but the tobacco companies have the real position of power  
incongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home  
we discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly  
he had been a very profitably rewarded vice-president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco ; now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family  
rather than support him his wife liane ( diane venora ) demands of him what are they supposed to do for income  
meanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand  
they offer wigand $12 , 000 just to interpret the data  
wigand's severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings , but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms  
he is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman  
in spite of the secrecy , wigand's former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role  
and so the game begins  
wigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer  
meanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family  
the film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants  
wigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out  
he and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight "

-1,"capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence  
visually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver's travels and treat it as an action film  
that makes it a film without much center  
 , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 
pierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a  k  a  monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire  
it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver's travels  
humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift's island of the houyhnhnms  
the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet  
it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that  
when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish  
the final irony of the original version has become film history  
without it there could never have been a "" planet of the apes "" film series  
i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language  
in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language  
that could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking  
serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film  
justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending  
but serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear  
few viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history  
partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith's best if not his best  
when the film's success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s  
while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases  
the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973  
now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again  
for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton's new version is even less faithful  
first , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes  
he has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes  
that could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes  
as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring  
in 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world's most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes  
then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet  
 ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect  ) 
he quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks  
and the language they talk is earth- english  
apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that  
the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn't occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film  
both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english  
in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships  
outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic  
leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter  
ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power "

a film which can easily be guessed out by the end of frame number one  
a film which is packed to the cap with predictability , leading to very little tension , excitement , suspense or interest on the part of its paying audience  
in short , a clich ? -ridden formula film  
welcome to my review of the general's daughter  
plot : an undercover army detective and a rape counselor find themselves locked inside an investigation into some bigwig general daughter's rape , torture and murder  
they must delve through all of the unspoken army rules and the hush-hushes , to figure out the conspiracy behind the shocking murder  
critique : by the numbers ( see above )  
this film is just there  
it sits there on the big screen for a couple of hours , floats around , goes away , hopefully never to be heard from again  
it is so predictable that even a blind man could see its plot points coming a mile away  
it's as suspenseful as a leaf dropping from a tree  
it's as action-packed as a canadian curling tournament  
get the picture ? 
i sure did    it's 
too bad that it took my friend and i less than two minutes to figure out the entire plot , and to break down each scene before it was even completed  
easy as pie  
it's unfortunate because james woods and john travolta actually have one extremely enjoyable scene together near the beginning of the film , but alas , t'was not to be ( that scene alone scored two of my four points allotted  ) 
woods chews it up in the few scenes that he's in , travolta passes the test , cromwell plays , well , cromwell , and stowe is window dressing with a smile ( mia since 12 monkeys ( 8/10 ) it seems )  
and this predictability isn't reserved only to those who have seen films like courage under fire or a few good men , it runs deep inside every one of us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug on the big screen  
it's like riding a bike  
other scenarios which sponge out any tension , suspense or interest from this film include every single character eventually "" breaking down "" to the investigators without much reason given , a ridiculously placed background relationship between two of the lead characters , as much action as my grandparents bedroom nightly , and a directorial style that can only reward director simon west with a solid nomination for the "" best poor man's michael bay doing his best poor man's impression of tony scott "" ( add two scenes with sunlight shining through some half-open shades for grit and integrity , and an all-out rainfall for the finale for further chaos , and you're a great director  
yawn  
yeah , whatever tony    i 
mean , simon  ) 
and aren't we all sick of hearing about these army "" bad boys "" and their overdone "" code of silence "" ? ! 
enough already ! 
next subject , please  
see it on video if you wanna fall asleep after seeing a much better movie like an officer and a gentleman ( 8  5/10 )  
otherwise , save yourself the trouble and go take a crap instead  
you'll feel much better afterwards  
trust me  
little known facts about this film and its stars : ironically , john travolta turned down the lead role in an officer and a gentleman , which eventually went to little dickie gere  
ironically on james woods' part , he completed one of his earliest acting roles on tv's "" welcome back , kotter "" , starring none other than john travolta  
actor james woods recently confirmed reports of his "" big dick "" on howard stern's radio program  
unlike rocker tommy lee , woods is also alleged to have an iq of 180  
he apparently scored a perfect 800 on his verbal sats and a 779 on the math section  
what a man ! 
john travolta is married to actress kelly preston , and they have a son named jett ( travolta loves them planes ! )  
word on the street is that the kid was apparently conceived during a weekend at demi moore and bruce willis' home  
director simon west's first film was the jerry bruckheimer produced con air ( 6  5/10 ) "

patch adams a film review by michael redman copyright 1999 by michael redman 
mediocrity is a pox on civilization  
in our heavily consumer oriented society , there is an enormous demand to churn out "" stuff  "" 
what would happen to our economy if we didn't feel the need to have more things ? 
to make us buy more , businesses need to produce a ton of product  
the sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality  
the film industry is like any other  
in order for studios to survive , they have to make money  
the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit  
some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that , less talented people are used  
there aren't enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary  
for some reason , it's never crossed anyone's mind that the real equation is quality films = more profit  
often , mediocre films are more of a pain for the audience than the horrendous ones  
at you can have a good time making fun of bad movies  
i'm not suggesting that "" patch adams "" was tossed out just to rake in the bucks  
my guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel  
it features an accomplished actor and a potentially engrossing story , but it's as dull as could be  
hunter "" patch "" adams' ( robin williams ) desire to become a doctor has an unusual genesis  
checking himself into a mental institute after a suicide attempt , he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning around  
patch could be a poster boy for co-dependency  
he explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he doesn't focus on his own problems  
he decides that he wants to be a physician , leaves the place and a couple of years later enrolls in the medical college of virginia  
as a med student , patch's antics at the school's hospital catch the attention of his soon to be arch-enemy , straight-laced dean walcott ( bob gunton )  
the dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school although he's one of the top students  
he writes in patch's academic file that he shows "" excessive happiness  "" 
i walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing  
there also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the early seventies  
then it struck me  
it must be based on a true story  
the movie is an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute , a free clinic  
robin williams is an amazing actor  
while he is adept at dramatic roles , his forte is over-the-top free spirits  
that's what makes his failure here so remarkable  
patch is exactly the character he should be best at , yet even the scene where he and another mental patient are battling fierce imaginary squirrels falls flat  
something holds him back  
most of the rest of the cast is two-dimensional  
for a film that champions seeing patients as human beings , it's curious that the ones here are cardboard characters  
peter coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like a real person  
unfortunately he's in the film for only about two minutes  
the audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene  
we're not left to our own emotional decisions : we're hit over the head with them  
shaved-headed children with cancer , an elderly woman whom patch makes laugh , a beautiful woman who can't love because of her abusive history  
when a group of students fix up an old house to use as a clinic in the andy hardy "" hey , let's put on a play ! 
we can use the barn and my mom can make the curtains ! "" 
mode , they laugh and roll around while painting each other  
there might as well be giant signs flashing : "" feel good now ! ""

taiwan's new wave came in the 1980s , in the work of directors like hou hsiao-hsien , wan jen , and edward yang ; that day , on the beach--yang's first feature--is central  
it created a new language for young taiwanese directors , even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and faltering  
later works refined the techniques that yang first explored here , giving taiwan a distinctive international presence  
that day itself is long and frustrating , the document of a nation's attempt to find a voice  
it does not lack ambition  
it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan , in the manner of antonioni , elaborating the alienation that the westernized white-collar middle-class feel as their lives are shaped by old-fashioned roles--dedicated career men , loyal housewives--that they find unfulfilling  
jia-li ( sylvia chang ) is the focus , but the film brings others into its compass--her husband , her brother , friends from her college days--as it charts her discontents  
no one is happy  
jia-li married her husband , we-lei , at a young age  
at the time , her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage , despite his affection for another woman , and so jia-li's marriage seemed , in comparison , a good one : she chose we-lei of her own free will , they loved each other  
but it goes wrong  
that day dutifully presents all the clich ? s : we-lei becomes absorbed in his career , indulges in an affair with a co-worker ; jia-li feels restless and trapped , bound by a choice she made while young , but which no longer seems wise  
the film never redeems these clich ? s by conveying the feel of authentic experience , the intensity of lived pain , and much of it seems trite and belaboured  
it unfolds , awkwardly , as a series of flashbacks , told during a luncheon in vienna , where jia-li meets her brother's old flame ( teresa hu ) , now a concert pianist , whom she has not seen since college  
both women seem rather sad , and resigned to their sadness  
their circumstances ( and those of jia-li's brother and a college friend ) suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices--married the wrong man , chosen the wrong career path , etc  --but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate  
it is not that jia-li married the wrong man ; she didn't  
the problem is that she needed to marry at all--and that if she did not marry , she would still be just as unhappy  
for a woman in modern taiwan , that day tells us , the cards are stacked , the dice are loaded : she can play the game , but the house always wins  
the film's sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan  
seen now , it does not seem provocative  
indeed , it's hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy : it may be ambitious , it may be innovative , but it is also terribly , terribly dull  
and what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us : yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others , and his use of those methods is fumbling , uncertain , undisciplined  
nor does he bring anything new--other than the locale--to the material  
there are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for--in a young couple's first kiss , in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husband's mistress--but they are brief  
too often , yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes--grocery shopping , flower-arranging--in which nothing happens , little is said , no emotion imparted  
perhaps , if the film were content to focus on such reflective , inward moments , leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings , it might have been ambiguous , suggestive , insinuating  
but jia-li and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence : they talk about their problems , at length , in detail , redundantly , and eliminate all subtleties  
at two hours and forty-five minutes , it all seems exorbitantly long , indulgently long-winded  
consider the defining moment for jia-li , the titular day on the beach  
the thrust of the whole film explains , easily enough , what we are to think of that moment , what it means when she walks away from a particular situation  
even so , the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally , in case we may have missed the point  
needless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed , and that is the problem throughout  
the look of the film is as tedious as the drawn-out narrative  
it was the first feature shot by christopher doyle--at least , it's his name in the credits--who is now rightly regarded as one of the world's leading cinematographers  
in the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong kar-wai , he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image  
you would never know it from watching that day , which , due either to doyle's inexperience or yang's humdrum direction , is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible  
in scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage , that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience , but none of the damage , none of the heartbreak "

-1,"synopsis : al simmons , top-notch assasin with a guilty conscience , dies in a fiery explosion and goes to hell  
making a pact with malebolgia , a chief demon there , simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn , a general in hell's army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives , chains , and a morphing cape  
sullen , wise cogliostro and flatulating , wisecracking violator vy for spawn's attention  
comments : when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics ( where he had made a name for himself as a first-rate comic book penciller on the "" spider-man "" titles ) to join the newly-formed , creator-owned image comics , a new comic book legend was born : spawn  
mcfarlane's "" spawn "" immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s  
mcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate , allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max  
the early "" spawn "" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane's genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing  
with the popularity of "" spawn "" and the success of the current warner bros  's batman film franchise , a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn  
in the summer of 1997 , hence , new line cinema released spawn , a live-action film based on the groundbreaking series  
this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book , like me , numbed by how much spawn misses the mark  
what happened ? 
why is spawn so bad ? 
todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo  
i don't think , however , that his presence necessarily hurt ( or helped ) the film  
i place the blame , in part , on the recent hollywood trend , fueled by public demand apparently , for special effects blow-out movies utilizing the latest computer technology  
these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else : character , plot , dialogue , etc  spawn , reflecting this trend , shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics  
hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires , explosions , knives and chains appearing out of nowhere , glowing eyes , or constantly transforming demons  
a lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid , don't get me wrong , but , because the script and cast aren't engaging , spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper ( the surface may capture the eye , but nothing exists underneath )  
spawn's translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level  
mcfarlane's spawn was a tortured hero  
a mercenary by trade , al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda  
having died and journeyed to hell , he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda  
simmons , however , discovers that his memories are fragmented , his body a creepy mess , and his wife married  
despite his sometimes violent nature , readers couldn't help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld  
spawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so  
when the characters are developed , they seem absurd rather than touching  
the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot ( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat-16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world ) do not help matters  
spawn , in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman , also unwisely spends too much time on a villain , the violator ( batman favored the joker over batman )  
john leguizamo , like jack nicholson in batman , receives top billing in the cast as the violator ; michael jai white ( al simmons / spawn ) is second  
i ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator  
the film , however , spends so much time on the violator's offensive antics that they grate on the nerves  
apparently meant to be the comic relief in the film ( as nicholson was in batman ) , especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn , the violator's lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny , leaving the audience wishing he would leave  
leguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role , but he is seen far too often in the film  
michael jai white , a relative newcomer to theatrical releases , seems to be an appealing actor , and he handles his role adequately , but we see little of him without various masks on  
more time needed to be spent on white's character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings  
a special note should be made about martin sheen as the over-the-top , obnoxious , evil general wynn  
easily the hammiest performance in the movie , it's hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much ; after all , he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now  
sheen's excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film  
many other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down  
mtv-style , jerky , in-your-face editing is one of them  
flames , for example , roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting  
cogliostro , unlikely wannabe guide for spawn , serves as a poor narrator for the film  
he goofily tells the audience , at one point , that "" how much of [spawn's] humanity is left remains to be seen , "" as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another "

-1,"the haunting , a film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of a horror film : to scare us  
if you've ever seen a movie , which you probably have considering you are on this website , you should know about all of the trivia they post before a movie  
they have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film  
but , the one i always like are the &quot ; other name&quot ; joke that try and rename a particular film  
for instance , the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film , small soldiers  
they had titles like little infantry and can i get those fatigues in a smaller size ? 
well , after seeing the haunting , i had a few particular names for it as well  
unfortunately , i can only post one of them , otherwise , i'd be getting some pretty angry e-mails from overprotective mothers  
that title would be the confusing  
ok , that is a pretty bad title , but it fits this film perfectly  
it basically serves up no purpose , and combined with dry dialogue and a boring and confusing plot , it completes the formula for a cinematic bomb  
liam neeson once again gets wrapped up in a film without any depth , but at least the phantom menace was exciting and had some depth  
the haunting is nothing but trash , but unfortunately , will still make a boatload of money  
before i rant and rave about how bad this film is , let me point out the few , and i stress the word few , bright spots in this film  
first , the house is great- looking  
it looks beautiful , but this is also a dark spot  
it looks so great that it is hard to be frightened by it  
this is something that rears its ugly head at all points of the film  
things look so great , that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight  
haunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful and that is being eerie  
the hill house is not eerie  
it is beautiful , but not the least bit frightening  
ever heard of lili taylor ? 
before this film i did not , but i am glad that i do now  
she gives the only satisfactory performance in the film  
despite the dry dialogue and boring/confusing concept , she manages to light up the screen every time she appears , but unfortunately , her co-stars are usually following right behind  
owen wilson , who plays luke , is the only other cast member even close to giving an admirable performance , other then taylor  
he is basically there for the comic relief , and his character development is poor in all other areas  
all of the characters are desperately underdeveloped  
wilson had potential as luke , but it seems they just needed him to add a few laughs  
liam neeson and catherine zeta-jones suffer from the dialogue and plot and should not have been in this film  
their characters must suffer from wicked mood swings because in each scene they turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave and whatnot  
they just are not believable and this is the final nail in the haunting's coffin  
the plot is terrible  
the opening scene of the film is very important , but the director makes it too obvious by getting close-ups of all the things that will play a major role in the end of the film  
as i sat through the film , i kept wondering what this film was trying to accomplish  
nell , lili taylor's character , goes from the hunted to the savior  
it makes no sense and the director gives the audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that take place in the film  
he forces the viewer to make various assumptions and does not give any in-depth information  
for instance , the beginning of the film gives us a sense of why nell is getting involved in the program  
but , we get zilch for the other four  
plus , two of them get wiped out in the first ten minutes  
and the worst part : most horror films have killings  
for some reason , they kill off luke at the end of the film  
no reason whatsoever , just off with his head , literally "
-1,"mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival  
as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival  
it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time  
in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry  
toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart  
the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it  
something else is what he did  
the film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life  
she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep  
meanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada  
she wants to build a career as an actress  
betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow  
she does not know who the woman is  
she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is  
they fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not  
meanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own  
he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george )  
these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong  
there is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion  
in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits  
a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun  
lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film  
he just chooses not to  
as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason  
there are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches  
the film is a little long for the subject matter  
toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot  
unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers  
i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale  
mulholland drive spoiler warning  
i have rated this film fairly low  
you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film  
david lynch is in large part a dark satirist  
most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside  
in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre  
what he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? ) 
playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on  
the first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout  
then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something  
the audience expectation is that they will add up  
but he has given clues that are self-contradictory  
lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories  
in fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke  
there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties "

-1,"i didn't hate the big hit , even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film  
for the entirety of its running time , my eyes were attached to the screen , and i never once got bored  
i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it's entertaining to watch it in the same way that it's entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl  
as a narrative , the big hit is pure garbage , never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries  
it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank , which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways  
it's fine to mix genres , if the film makers know what they're doing  
unfortunately , writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don't seem to know how to handle the material , and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy  
the biggest problem with the amalgamation , in this case , is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place  
but it sure is a fascinating failure  
marky  
  
  
er , mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley , a hitman  
he's a good hitman , apparently , although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious ( he doesn't snipe or make clean kills--he just kicks the door down and shoots everything )  
he works with a few other hitmen--cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) , crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) , and vinnie ( antonio sabbato , jr  )  
they're a nice bunch of muscular guys , who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex  
they all work for a man named paris ( avery brooks ) , who is rich , powerful , and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen  
it is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own ; this , of course , is where the plot comes in  
they decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko ( china chow ) , who has a rich father  
when they do this , it turns out she is paris'  
  
  
goddaughter ! 
it's very bad to have paris against you  
the story is standard action film stuff  
it's nothing new , and nothing particularly offensive ( but certainly not the slightest bit compelling )  
clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it's a john woo-type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy  
it's true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face/off and the replacement killers , which are both far superior )  
there are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story  
they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns  
melvin is also very good at breakdancing , and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives  
like i said , it's not boring ; most disasters aren't  
what makes it so bad is its genre-shifting madness  
it seems to start out as a quirky-but-realistic action comedy , as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains  
then , as soon as they go to their first hit , it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere  
then , somewhere in between , it turns back into comedy  
keiko turns out to be a spunky little girl ; in one amusing scene , she is forced to read a letter out loud , indicating that she has been kidnapped , but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words  
and scenes like this work alone , but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious , or not be in the film at all  
one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped ; when cisco gets there , paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it , but they let him out of there , telling him to find the perpetrator  
the scene is played for laughs , but it isn't funny  
and since it doesn't quite work as a comedy , it tries to fall back on the action , which also fails  
this is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun  
cars land on tree branches and are supported by them "
