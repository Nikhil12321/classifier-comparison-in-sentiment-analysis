1,"many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come , the new film by visionary director vincent ward  
most will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors  
but little do they know ( as i so plainly found out ) that this has quite a complex story to tell  
walking out of the theater , i could see the audience's disgust    
one member even had to be awakened after the film ended  
don't believe the previews that you see    
this is definitely not a film for everyone  
this is quite possibly one of the most adult-oriented films to come out in recent years  
kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline  
the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us  
it goes back and forth in time , as if it has no boundaries  
think of the film city of angels  
now add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision  
both films deal with the afterlife , but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office  
costing around $85 million to make , the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it's money back  
but due to it's story , i doubt it will  
for everyone who thought titanic's story was too simple and cliche , here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay , it may not have done nearly as well  
but don't get me wrong    
i hope the film does do well  
it's a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen  
i doubt most of us could have thought of this place , even in our own mind  
what dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals  
the only film that surpasses it is dark city  
full of rich , shocking colors , we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to  
but don't do that , because you'll end up going to hell  
what dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake  
chris "" christy "" nielsen ( robin williams ) is startled by the sudden jolt , but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat  
annie ( annabella sciorra ) spies chris , as well , and both eventually bond and get married  
annie is an artist , whose paintings are colorful , lush , and surrealistic  
chris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself  
they also have two children , marie ( jessica brooks ) and ian ( josh paddock )  
but one day , the two children are killed in a car crash , and it almost destroys annie  
she tries to commit suicide , but fails , and is then put in an institution  
chris copes with the problem by realizing they aren't around anymore , and nothing will change that  
just as annie gets her life back in order , chris is killed while trying to save the life of a car crash victim  
chris goes to heaven , or his version of heaven , rather  
guided by albert ( cuba gooding , jr  ) , chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy  
that is , until he realizes how miserable he is without annie  
prior to heaven , he would try to comfort annie , but the more he was around , the more pain she felt  
chris decides to leave her alone  
little does he realize what will happen next  
i'm not about to say , because the plot point is crucial to the rest of the story ( many critics , however , give it away )  
certainly , chris dying is crucial to the plot , but they tell you that he dies in the previews  
story is not necessarily important for this movie to work , because it deals with the afterlife  
however , strangely , virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil  
a couple of comments here and there , but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life  
 "" we're soul mates ! "" 
chris exclaims  
heaven , in movies , is almost always depicted as a glowing city of white , purity , and love  
usually , it also looks like it rests among the clouds  
but what dreams may come goes a different route  
it shows us a heaven that most of us have never seen before  
chris' heaven is his memories brought to life  
his thoughts can make anything real , and he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven  
 "" i've never seen anyone use real paint before , "" albert says  
equally good as the depictions of hell which cast away the normal stereotypes of fire and brimstone  
instead , it's a state of being  
in one gloriously horrific scene , chris and his "" tracker "" ( max von sydow ) arrive at a sea of faces  
thousands of heads are stuck above ground , their bodies somewhere else  
mostly dead silent , some quips are made , almost as if to lighten the mood  
it's truly a frightening sequence  
production designer eugenio zanetti is definitely going to be up for an oscar nomination  
using state of the art computer technology , worlds are created for exploration  
sometimes , some scenes play out as if they are only there for the visual impact  
it's not necessary to be there , but we appreciate seeing it  
costume designer yvonne blake ( who also appears in the film ) has done an incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes  
cinematographer eduardo serra , whose work was last seen in the luscious wings of the dove , has a difficult job , as most cinematographers do working with special effects  
but serra's entire universe is a computer generated image , and he does a masterful job  
writer ron bass , adapting from the novel by richard matheson , provides a very fluid screenplay with no real set plot  
the story is extremely vague in its details , allowing viewers to think for themselves about the meaning  
and director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision  
what dreams may come is a good example of german expressionism which may just turn off a good portion of the audience  
your average movie goer more than likely isn't used to expressionistic techniques  
the film will also definitely draw attention from religious people , but they shouldn't take it too far  
it is , after all , just a movie  
robin williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances , while his comedic roles have been suffering  
his comedy is perfection when he makes up his own stuff , but when is confined by a screenplay , he isn't quite as effective  
but drama is really his strong point , and you can see that here  
it's doubtful he'll get another oscar nomination , but i wouldn't really mind if he did  
the real surprise here is annabella sciorra who impressed last year with cop land  
this may be her breakout role and may garner her some much needed attention  
it's also quite possible that she could get an oscar nomination  
however , the academy doesn't like to award performances for these types of films  
cuba gooding , jr  has been better , but he's certainly not distracting "

1,"ladies and gentlemen , 1997's independence day is here ! 
it's title : starship troopers  
and surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4  
i realize that i gave last year's sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour  
after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn't as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review  
starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem  
as a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film  
in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film  
starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether  
while starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : "" the 'star wars' of the 90s  "" 
am i being to generous to this film ? 
perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races  
in essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction  
the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to  
starship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a "" kick-the-aliens'-asses "" style  
id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role  
this new "" star wars "" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs  an alien species  
the alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects  
however , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy  
sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization  
more than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends  
and they should be  
i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film  
this is an "" event "" film , but surprisingly above average  
it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved )  
starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange "" join the army "" ads  
mixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original  
stating , "" would you like to know more ? "" , 
these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously  
however , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way  
after witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw  
we are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards )  
rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms  
however , carmen isn't as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot  
however , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico  
unfortunately , rico isn't interested in dizzy  
this setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch  
carmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up  
and as a result , dizzy signs up  
everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry  
the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships  
in reality , i found myself watching a space version of "" melrose place , "" but with better special effects  
an hour into the film , the war begins  
a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with  
the first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must )  
following the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war  
the bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else  
many dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs' attacks  
a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense  
the troopers are ordered to locate the "" brain "" and capture it  
i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot  
it's about special effects and gory violence  
director verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall  
verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood  
starship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year's event horizon  
the r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it  
my guess is that verhoeven's target audience is the 18 to 25 male group  
the film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women  
despite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful  
while watching the film , we never second guess the character's decisions because they seem perfectly clear  
thankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with  
the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you  
casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon  
to most guys , he will come across as artificial  
fortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character  
dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character  
her dizzy is extremely likeable  
denise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done  
jake busey , gary busey's son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film  
neil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast  
however , he does give a good performance  
michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm  
his performance rises above the rest  
perhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside's presence on screen  
unfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars  
director verhoeven is the main star of the film  
his direction is fast and unrelentless  
he never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride  
writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein  
the writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny  
the dialogue is smart but not too smart  
we aren't required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered  
thankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don't ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while )  
amazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues  
in fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story  
the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage  
i haven't laughed this loud , even in some comedies  
oh , and the special effects are first rate  
starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci-fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity  
believe me when i say this : don't take young kids to see this film  
it is extremely violent  
in fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year  
however , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain "

1,"most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts  
my family , for the most part , hates him and his movies  
i think he's very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years  
so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of  
unrestrained by physical boundaries , allen's humor comes shining through  
those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen's intelligent observations of life  
those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one  
in 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they'd never seen before  
toy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present  
many critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture  
antz , however , has upped the ante considerably  
disney's a bug's life isn't due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal  
by beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience's thirst for computer-animated films  
but don't let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared  
in the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios  
in 1997 , it was the volcano duel  
in my opinion , dante's peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality  
volcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations  
in 1998 , there are twice as many competing films  
first was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it's cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact  
but now , it's even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks )  
who will prevail ? 
time will tell , but i'm sure that mr  mouse has nothing to fear  
this may sound like i didn't like antz ; on the contrary , i'd put it up there with toy story  
but due to it's pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn't appear in disney's version  
some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film  
sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd  
the humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended  
this is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents  
antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen's shtick and franz kafka's metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug  
z ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker  
 "" when you're the middle child in a family of five million    "" he comments about his neglected childhood  
one night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life  
in walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown  
bala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader  
after discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there's a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony  
in order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants  
but to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her  
he and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed  
the queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony  
meanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him  
so z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites  
the battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence  
however , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence  
the second half of the film revolves around z's kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia  
there , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants  
the adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass  
looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i'm just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally )  
the ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground  
visually , it's an exciting rush of adrenaline  
but don't be fooled    
little kids shouldn't see this , as they may just try and copy it  
after seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again  
hopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel  
as an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date  
visually , it's as stunning as what dreams may come  
the best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren't limited by gravity  
they can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible  
one great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball  
the animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball  
however , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy's shoe  
it's truly a great example of film making at its finest  
with computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices  
the best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover )  
at one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores    
do they ? )  
barbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body  
young kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course )  
disney's a bug's life looks good , but i don't know if they will be able to best dreamworks' newest animated feature in terms of animation  
if not , then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do : go head to head with the big mouse , and knock him down ( yes , anastasia was good , but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney )  
vocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line-ups seen since toy story  
in fact , it far exceeds that one  
woody allen has always been funny , but here he transcends most of what he's done in the past few years  
without a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing  
in fact , i'm pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines  
sharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress  
sylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star  
after a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is  
gene hackman is superb as the gruff-talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona  
christopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns  
anne bancroft has a minimal role , but she's effective nonetheless  
danny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job  
dan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro-trash bees--both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd  
jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people won't recognize her voice either "

1,"alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters  
i saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i didn't like it  
of course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault  
in order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor  
james cameron's aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series  
i am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality  
many thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action  
both are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well-written  
as for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion  
perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped  
on the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn't see  
it was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh  
i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities  
don't get me wrong--i'm not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting  
however , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters  
as a result , alien 3's only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters  
we never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie  
there were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt  ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films  
the other character was dr  clemens ( charles dance ) , but because we like him , the inevitable occurs  
alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off  
the prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry  
without using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film  
an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card  
we see lt  ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments    
 ( title )

and so on and so on  
during these first ten minutes , i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed  
it's quite a remarkable opening , and one which will remain in my mind for a long time  
because of this face-hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens , the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod , and sent down to the nearest planet : fiorina fury-161 , an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison  
however , the face-hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo-tubes , and is sent down with the escape pod  
unfortunately , during the landing , all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed  
ripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery  
of course , you need a carrier for this face-hugger , and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates  
ripley is revived and asks to see the ship  
after seeing a mysterious acid-eaten section , ripley asks to see the dead bodies , and then have them cremated  
this cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films  
featuring a monologue from dillon ( charles s  dutton ) , a prisoner who has found god , the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dog's demise  
it's one of the most memorable moments , as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog  
and this is where alien 3 succeeds  
fincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films , and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock ( in fact , he is the mixture of both )  
fincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it , and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films  
alien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images  
by doing so , fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise  
many people have criticized fincher's filming of the death scene of ripley ( i reveal nothing by saying this ) as looking too fake , but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal  
showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch , but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron , a great deal of symbolism is derived  
i feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron  
however , most people seem to want to witness ripley die ( which creates a paradox , as she is the character i didn't want to see die )  
why she is killed is one of the surprises of the film , and i don't plan on spoiling that in this review  
>from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever  
in alien , it was , of course , the moment the alien burst out of kane's stomach  
in aliens , it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine  
alien 3 has several , but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley  
ripley is pushed up against a wall , and the alien stands inches away from her  
why it doesn't kill her is a shocker , which later leads to a surprise ending  
fincher apparently loves to use close-ups of actors' faces ( michael douglas and the clown face-off in the game in the same style ) , and by shaving off the actors' hair , the only thing we have to look at is their faces  
many critics didn't like all the actors being bald , but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot  
most of alien 3 works when you take it in context of the story , but when you try to compare it to its predecessors , fincher's turn seems a bit gloomy and dark , though that's not always a bad thing  
the plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films , with some major twists  
again , we are setup with several different characters , and one by one , they are picked off  
however , while the first two had tons of arsenal ( especially cameron's film ) , alien 3 takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this run-down prison  
as a result , no weapons are to be found  
this creates a lot of tension , although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense  
as an alien film , alien 3 is the worst of the series , but by itself , it is an extremely well-made motion picture , with a lot more merits than not  
the unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the one-dimensional characters  
i never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about  
despite this , ripley was the central figure , and that's what is important  
we care for her , even though she began to act just like one of the guys  
again , the technical side of this film is remarkable , and better than the two previous versions  
while cameron's version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary , fincher uses brilliant camera angles , terrific lighting , and moody sets  
the cinematography , by alex thomson , is very well done , with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie  
the confusion of the ending draws the viewer in , as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around "

1," "" say , any of you know how to madison ? "" 
--- brad "" asshole "" majors ( barry bostwick ) shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show  
the story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend  
in the early 70's , stage actor turned first-time playwright richard o'brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b-movies he had grown up with as a child , set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design  
the result was the stage play the rocky horror show , which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england  
the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later , in october of 1974  
the film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975    
and immediately tanked at the box office  
whether it was because fox wasn't quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn't quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop  
it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters  
a year later , something entirely strange and magical happened  
prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film  
this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time  
word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show's life as the ultimate cult film was born  
for the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton  
brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed  
they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr  everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home  
remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance  
the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet-stocking wearing mad scientist dr  frank-n-furter ( tim curry )  
frank-n-furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood )  
as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank-n-furter's mad schemes  
little do any of them know that the doctor's handyman , riff-raff ( original author richard o'brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth  
going back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has  
if i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i don't think i would have known what to make of it either  
for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film  
by the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o'brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b-movies his film is based on  
when i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity  
it goes without saying that the "" time warp "" is the most popular song in the film  
even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song  
what those who haven't seen the movie don't know though , is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment  
my personal favorite is "" over at the frankenstein place "" , but "" dammit janet "" is also maddeningly catchy  
tim curry's vocals on the rocking tune "" sweet transvestite "" need to be heard to be believed  
the finale of the film , a big floor show staged by frank-n-furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets ( including barry bostwick    
frightening ! ) , features no less than four songs ( "" rose tint my world "" , "" don't dream it "" , "" wild and untamed thing "" , and "" i'm going home "" ) , all of which are immensely singable  
the film's true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though  
despite the catchiness of the songs , this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn't have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show  
watching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans ( unless you don't mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place )  
note : director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film , in the form of a sequel , resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment , which picks up with brad and janet ( this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper ! ) as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton  
the two are menaced by the evil tv station manager ( also played by de young ) , who wishes to claim janet as his own  
o'brien returned as a writer/performer on the project ( as did quinn , campbell , and gray in performance capacity only ) , but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original  
25 years later , this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world  
as a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans , a brand new special edition 2-disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date ( even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary )  
if you are one of those people who can't get enough of the film , this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites  
in an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film , fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2-disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it'll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all  
the film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1  85 : 1 ( enhanced for 16x9 televisions )  
the film is presented in two different versions , the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called "" superheroes ""  
for ambitious viewers , the disc also includes a hidden version ( located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner ) which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen  
originally , the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz , with the first half of the it seen in black and white ( and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number )  
most reports , including a documentary on the disc , say that the color was supposed to appear when frank-n-furter first shows up in the elevator , but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version , depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced  
the film contains a commentary track by show creator ( and faithful handyman ) richard o'brien and co-star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable ( and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and half-naked on freezing cold sets , which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews )  
the two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell , but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore ( and there are quite a few )  
fox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments  
the first feature ( and the most simple ) is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is  
the second feature is an audience participation track , which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show  
most of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off , but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter  
the final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd , where a pair of lips will appear on-screen during certain scenes of the film ( mostly during the musical numbers ) that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote  
when selected , you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world  
once the segment is over , you are deposited right back into the film where you left off  
the first disc also contains a few dvd-rom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player  
there is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation , a video jukebox , a you don't know jack-styled trivia game ( which is about as bare bones a you don't know jack parody as it can be ) , and a bizarre mad-libs styled word game known as riff-raff's story lab  
links to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvd-rom portion of the disc  
the second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras  
former lite-rock video channel turned music historians vh-1 have allowed some of their outtake footage from the "" behind the music : rocky horror "" special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here , as well as a pop-up video for the meat loaf-sung "" hot patootie ""  
the "" behind the music "" segments are all very interesting , especially richard o'brien's jaunt through the castle ( which is now a hotel ! ) where the film was originally shot  
there are also extensions of the sarandon , bostwick , quinn , o'brien , and meat loaf interviews  
as far as extras for the film itself go , there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here  
one of which is just the "" superheroes "" number available in the uk version , but there is also another rare musical number presented here called "" once in a while ""  
a series of alternate takes are also presented here , but none of them are really much of a revelation ( except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwick's pants )  
for the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia , a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here  
rounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show , two theatrical trailers ( proclaiming that the film is "" a different sort of jaws "" ) , a still gallery , and two sing-a-longs ( for "" toucha toucha touch me "" and "" sweet transvestite "" )  
fox's special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives ( "" you're lucky    
i'm lucky    
he's lucky    
we're all lucky ! "" )  
it's not just amazing enough that tons of classic italian films are finally getting their recognition in the u  s  , but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format  
as with their excellent dvds of the abyss , fight club , independence day , and the sound of music , fox shows that they have most certainly made the commitment to provide the things that dvd lovers want  
i raise a toast to them ( cue the throwing of the bread ) as i cut out the lights , sit back , and watch those disembodied lips begin to sing about b-movie tradition "

1,"natural born killers is really a very simple story that , in essence , has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis , mood and degree  
both films glamorize "" outlaws , "" in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers  
both relate the story of a couple liberated by love  
but where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle , natural born killers is total and blatant  
where bonnie & clyde was social , natural born killers is psychological  
what bonnie & clyde hinted at , natural born killers confronts and explores  
what bonnie and clyde stole , mickey and mallory kill  
to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them , expressed metaphorically as killing , subdues the mysterious power this film wields  
for the most part , when mickey and mallory kill , they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily , they kill what is trying to kill them , they kill what dissembles and cowers from life , they kill what needs to be killed  
this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity  
brahma created  
vishnu preserved  
and siva destroyed , but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma  
the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate , i'm forced to say it for clarity's sake : a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes , that is , destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics  
your plumber , bonnie and clyde , mickey and mallory , and siva are all productive destroyers  
i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death , presently and historically , than any other phenomena  
muslims kill christians  
hindus kill muslims  
christians kill pagans  
jews kill christians , etc  you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged  
religion is an orgy of killing  
the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn't been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable  
 "" the state is the divine idea upon earth , "" hegel said , meaning it is absolute , all-powerful , ineffable , unassailable , infallible , authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh , allah , god , etc  
well , what does all this have to do with natural born killers ? 
let me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex  
consider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever  
god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc  they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other  
during the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power  
 ( parenthetically , witness plato as well  
in the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime  
not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions  ) 
catholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil  
it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure  
masturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution  
this is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence  
as further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters  
our culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years  
we can't help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self  
mickey and mallory knox internalized them , too , then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other , discovered them , and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves  
it is a straightforward liberation through sex  
as some good patriarch once observed , "" you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on  "" 
m&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions  
they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions  
 "" the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers , "" as mickey says  
as a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter : let us look each other in the face  
we are hyberboreans--we know well enough how remote our place is  
 "" neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans "" : even pindar , in his day , knew that much about us  
beyond the north , beyond ice , beyond death--our life , our happiness     
we have discovered that happiness ; we know the way ; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth  
who else has found it ? --the 
man of today ? -- "" i 
don't know either the way out or the way in ; i am whatever doesn't know either the way out or the way in "" --so sighs the man of today     
this is the sort of modernity that made us ill--we sickened in lazy peace , cowardly compromise , the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay  
this tolerance and largeur of the heart that "" forgives "" everything because it "" understands "" everything is a sirocco to us  
rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds ! 
as far as i can tell , this is what the movie has to say  
its alleged critique of the media is only secondary , tertiary , quaternary , subsidiary for sure  
for example wayne gayle's first report ends with some gen x dude saying , "" if i were a mass murderer i'd be mickey and mallory , "" in his most excellent bill and ted voice  
on one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical , impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes  
it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he'd be just like them , killing and destroying what deserves it  
let me exemplify what i've been saying by analyzing a scene from the film , namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant , kills him , and then castigates him for giving her "" the worst fuckin' head i've ever had in my life ! ! ! "" 
now , i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship , because demonstrably they didn't , and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this  
sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations , but unwilling to kill each other , since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation , they must kill in place of their lever  
it's no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey  
as the attendant approached he took on mickey's character in the eyes of mallory  
she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory  
upon discovery , mallory views this as a betrayal , judges him , and commutes his sentence on someone else  
the style of the movie is a whole 'nother matter that i won't get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power  
let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness , barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle  
the rapid succession of all those 8mm , 16mm , 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish , frenetic mood  
also , jungian archetypes abound  
these can't help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames  
some of the best scenes and lines that come to mind  ( quotes are paraphrased only ) : 
mickey to mallory : "" one of these days i'm gonna be cummin' for you , "" in prison , while mallory jacks mickey off  
semen is a symbol for great potential and things to come  
at the time they haven't yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet  
the two of course go hand in hand  
for an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs  
mickey during his marriage to mallory : "" as creator of my universe , i pronounce us man and wife  "" 
the way woody delivers this line is truly haunting , but telling , too  
it reveals m&m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones  
this is what mickey means by "" creator of my universe , "" he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes  
it is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears  
scagnetti's first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant's mouth  
the indian sage releasing mallory's father , who was reincarnated as a snake : "" old man , go be a snake , "" after telling his "" snake story "" that ends with "" bitch , you knew i was a snake  "" 
after mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare , mallory says , "" you killed life ! ! ! "" 
this is another telling quote because it implies they didn't see themselves as killers of life  
then what were they killing up to that time ? 
in some case just those zombies faking their way through life , the living dead , as it were  
in other cases , all the anti-life forces , the cops and their parents "

1,"i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video  
it really scared me , and i didn't want to go see it  
however , after i heard about how wonderful it was , i wanted to see it  
i didn't get a chance to do so , until now  
the film , disney's 25th animated feature , opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale : a long time ago in the land of prydain , there was a king so evil , that his spirit was captured in the cauldron  
it has been hidden for centuries , and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors , and with them rule the world ? and destroy it  
then , we meet a farmer-wizard , dallben , and his young apprentice , taran  
taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a `pig-keeper' ( they have a pig named hen-wen )  
one day , as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath , the pig goes crazy , and dallben then realizes , after watching hen wen's thoughts through a bucket of water , that taran must hide hen wen in the forest  
an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron , and only hen wen has the power to show its location  
taran leads hen wen into the forest , but of course , he loses her , and tries to go find her  
along the way , he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi , who desires `munchings and crunchings' , much to his dismay ( besides , he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen )  
when he hears hen wen's squeal from far away , though , he races to her rescue ? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants  
taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king's castle from far away  
taran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen  
he manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon  
there , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls  
along the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie  
the three manage to escape the horned king's castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic  
as they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen's trail  
he leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of `pig tracks' , to a whirlpool  
suddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy-like fairfolk  
taran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva  
he then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world  
with the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage  
it turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place  
when taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ? in exchange for his sword  
taran agrees , much to eilonwy's horror , but at least they get the black cauldron  
but ? the cauldron can't be destroyed , only its evil powers can be stopped  
the only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive  
things take a turn for the worse when the horned king's henchmen capture taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr , along with the black cauldron , and lead them back to the castle  
taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors ( this is the most horrifying scene in the film , because here , a dead army comes alive ? )  
just when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr  
taran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away  
gurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay  
taran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king  
he kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely  
taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king's castle just as it self-destructs  
the witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they `never give anything away , they bargain'  
in response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi  
the trade is made ; gurgi's seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group  
as taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs-he is not dead after all ! 
the happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return  
as spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times  
before ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions , he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron , a sword and sorcery tale for the studio  
bringing this book to the screen was the studio's fondest dream  
miller , who entitled himself as the executive producer , promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects  
when micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio , the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron  
by this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department  
many of the studio's old men had retired or died  
therefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film  
originally budgeted at $25 million , the costs raised to $40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped  
the film was rated pg and the film , although `disneyfied' from lloyd alexander's chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney's other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it  
in addition , other critics rejected it for having `no heart' and `unmemorable' , compared to other disney animated features  
but whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $21 million  
the failure of the film grounded the studio's animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio's reputation  
the next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , didn't do much better ( although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective )  
only with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features  
as for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron  
finally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released  
because of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ? 
the people who had seen the film didn't think so  
in fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it  
for a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom  
few people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who hadn't seen the film yet ( i am included here ) , they got quite a treat  
but people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g )  
somewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , `bring back the black cauldron ! ' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states  
before that time , rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed , like the uk video , so that it would get a g rating , and that they would add in songs  
those rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron * would * be released in its pg rated version  
even still , when it was finally released to the us , some reaction was mixed  
some felt that it was indeed cut , but some felt that it wasn't  
but these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable , since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available  
as for myself , when i saw the movie for the first time ( on converted ntsc video ) , i didn't expect much at all  
in fact , i had heard so many mediocre things about it , that i didn't think the film would ever be such a good film  
much to my surprise , when i saw the first few minutes of the film , i was asking myself , "" this is the same film everyone saw ? 
the one that flopped at the box office ? 
the one that critics and filmgoers alike called "" a bad movie "" ? 
this doesn't seem like all of the above  
instead , it's a classic in its own right  
the film has a wonderful cast of characters  
there's taran ( grant bardsley ) , an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig-keeper , the story's hero  
the critics have said that taran is not likeable at all , but the opposite is true  
he is brave , loyal , and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on  
there's a likeable character here ! 
not that he's the only likeable character in the film  
there's gurgi ( john biner ) , a lovable little , uh , thing who remains loyal to taran , even though they don't quite hit it off at first  
but another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman , a dwarf named creeper ( phil fondacairo ) , who is loyal to the film's imaginative and sinister villain , the horned king ( voiced gruesomely by john hurt ) , yet he also fears his neck  
the other characters , including the sidekicks , a spunky , but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm , and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret , although pleasant and likeable , aren't quite as well rounded as they should be  
the story itself is an adventurous one , a quest involving the mystical pig , hen wen , the black cauldron itself , and an army of deathless ones with everything : a hooking opening to a spectacular finale  
elmer bernstein's music also tells the story perfectly , in a dark , yet calming manner  
the animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios  
even though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good , like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth , the animation overall is top notch  
overall ? this film is an entertaining endeavor  
fans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one , except young kids  
there are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney's other films ( although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary ) , which is the main reason why this film is rated pg  
fans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie  
even though it doesn't have all of the ingredients of a true disney film , this film is a classic in its own right , and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given "

1,"as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it , the more pleased i was when i left  
first , getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz : "" if you liked scream , you'll love wild things ! "" 
 "" campbell gives a stunning performance ! "" 
 "" this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days ! "" 
 ( oh yeah , the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me ) 
now , onto more serious stuff ( and with this film , i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way )  
wild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa  
i'm not saying that in a bad way , but when you see this film , you may be shocked by what you see  
however , perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film's charming cast and tricky plot , that they let the film slide with an r rating  
being mormon , i'm bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film  
trouble is , i have already seen it  
and i like it ! 
wild things is a film noir of the 90s , filled with 40s sensibilities , and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture  
the style in which it is filmed is rich in color  
the actors are all gorgeous people , seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film  
sure , it's all too good to be true , but ain't it fun to watch ? 
when movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it  
there will be people who don't want to admit liking what they see , but i tell you , most anyone who sees this will like it  
wild things begins at blue bay high school , the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into  
it's almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone )  
of course , there are those select few who may look slightly ugly , but compared to the average person , they are gorgeous  
immediately , the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time  
we can turn off our brains , right ? 
wrong  
while you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn't turn out that way  
the film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present  
there's sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students  
he's heading the class discussion  
there's also kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam  
teaching the class , however , are two policemen : ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) , who want to talk about 'sex    
 ( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) '  
 "" what is a sex crime ? "" 
ray asks  
 "" not gettin' any ! "" 
one student responds  
this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch  
however , upon hearing this , one student , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , stands up and leaves the room , commenting that they can both kiss part of her body  
and so , wild things sets into motion  
quickly , kelly begins hitting on sam , but sam doesn't want anything to do with her advances  
kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him  
she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep  
surprisingly , that's really all i can tell you about the plot  
any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists  
and what's more , these plot twists are actually unpredictable  
going along the way of scream , wild things maintains that film's surprises , and then adds even more to them  
there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen  
and even though you think you may get tired of them , the surprises are so genuine that it's rather pleasing  
going back over them in my mind , nearly all of them work , though some stretch the boundaries of belief  
thankfully , the convoluted plot doesn't give us much time to think about each one , pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off  
as for the critics who complain that the film is trashy--well , it is  
this is pretty much just one trashy film  
however , it is the kind of trashy that isn't hard to watch  
it's good trash , in a sense  
one , the screenplay knows that it's not to be taken seriously , and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story  
this varies everywhere from kelly's mother ( theresa russell ) , who is more of a caricature of rich people , all the way to an ambulance-chasing lawyer ( bill murray ) , who wears a neck-brace to cover an insurance scam he is running  
bill murray also provides the best character in the film , and most of the genuine laughs  
and two , the sex is more than gratuitous , although not unwelcomed  
wild things is supposed to have sex in it ( what film with that title wouldn't ? ) , and this movie breaks the boundaries  
instead of having heterosexual sex scenes , it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell ( don't worry    
it's not as graphic as you might think )  
the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic , but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon's full-frontal nude scene  
it's very brief , so if you blink , you may miss ( ahem ) it  
and , for as long as i can remember , i don't think i have seen an r-rated film show an erect one before ( it's not completely , but judging from the audiences' reaction , it was more than they expected too )  
also , during one scene late in the film , there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon's characters , but nothing came of it ( makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating , or if the actors refused to do it )  
what first made me want to see wild things was its cast  
neve campbell , of course , has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released  
here , however , she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead  
the closest role to this was her performance in the craft ( though even in that she was a nice girl )  
campbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent  
you can tell she will be around for a long time  
denise richards will also be around for a long time , although she may be limited to the roles without much range  
here , she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff ( yet effective ) performance in starship troopers  
hopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability  
and then there is daphne rubin-vega , a newcomer to the movies  
she gives a very good performance , although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half  
towards the end she does get a bigger part  
on the male side , matt dillon is probably the best , giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist  
kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character , but he makes the most of it  
you must have admiration , though , for what he did on screen  
and judging from many of the women's reactions in the theater to that shot , they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon ( yeah , right )  
and then there is bill murray  
his performance is the comic relief , and he nearly steals the film  
as a whole , the entire cast works wondrously together , and they seem at home , even when doing the menage a troi  
director john mcnaughton , who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry : portrait of a serial killer , has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works  
his direction is smooth and stylish  
the visuals are striking , filled with rich colors , and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air  
however , he seems more at home when the actors aren't talking  
his fly-by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant , and his photography of denise richards' climbing out of the pool is a highlight  
the cinematography is gorgeous in its details  its not often that you see a film like this , and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures  
then , there is the music  
this was probably the most obvious thing to me , as it set the perfect mood for the film  
it's hard to describe in words , so just see the film and listen to it  
it's wonderfully composed and presented  
and be sure to stick around during the closing credits ! 
mcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use ( while most comedies use it for outtakes )  
he has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events "

1," ""   it's certainly more than just a monster story   "" 
- kenneth branagh , director/actor/co-writer of mary shelley's frankenstein  
kenneth branagh's new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein-films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world , including the most controversial version of them all - directed by james whale  
the dark and stormy nights , the lightning bolts , the charnel houses of spare body parts , the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful  
but the center of the film , quieter and more thoughtful , contains the real story  
horror-fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror  
branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues : morality , philosophy and human elements of the story , and not on old fashioned horror cliches  
his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel  
the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean  
the year is 1794  
a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters  
his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs  
as the ice closes around his ship , a figure appears on the horizon  
it's a man  
exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew  
his name is victor frankenstein ( kenneth branagh ) and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown  
the myserious stranger begins his tale , or more precisely his confession , in geneva , 1773  
he is remembering his childhood and youth  
laughter , banquets and parties - a happy life , without troubles or concerns  
here victor lived with his father ( ian holm ) , mother ( cherie lunghi ) , his surrogate sister ( helena boham carter ) and his servants in happiness and harmony  
this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed  
like thunder from a quite sky , his mother dies , giving birth to his youngest brother  
shocked , baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair , victor ( already interested in science ) becomes obsessed with death  
standing on his mother's grave he says : "" oh mother   you 
did not have to die    no one should ever die    i 
will stop this   i 
promiss   "" 
after proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished , victor travels to ingolstadt , in presuite of a medical career  
after a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night , creating life from death  
composing dead bodies , frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man - both physically and mentally  
with strong electrical impulses , he managed to breeth life into his creation  
the result was ugliness  
realizing what he has done , frankenstein tried to undo his work , but it was to late  
the creature has escaped  
because of the epidemic , frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home , making plans for the wedding  
for a while everything is as it was before his mother's death  
but then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously    
whale's picture , although powerful , never managed to capture the total depth of the novel  
brannagh has more or less done that  
another thing is characters and actors  
branagh has developed every character and assembled a magnificent cast  
the greatest performances comes from de niro - the monster , that has been played by ( among others ) charles ogle , karloff , lon chaney , bela lugosi , glenn strange , christopher lee , fred gwynne ( as herman munster ) , and now , robert de niro  
alone , hated and feared , he is completely aware of his ugliness  
at first he is like a helpless , abandoned child , desperately reaching out for love  
later when he reads frankenstein's journal , and learns that he is composed of dead bodies , his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge  
he is capable of killing without regret  
 "" i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground     and 
then i slowly crushed his neck    and 
as i killed him , i saw your face   "" 
that is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator  
and yet , he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable : "" for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all  "" 
rarely has a cinematic interpretation of "" the daemon "" approached the level of three-dimensionality and humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel  
another vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein  
in most of the previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates a monster ( god knows why ! ) with the power of an electrical storm  
almost no time was granted on his charecter , who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel  
here , branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein , establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death , sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment , and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene  
branagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character  
on the outside he is strong , ambitious and talented scientist , but deep down he is unsecure , fragile and vaulerble , constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past  
helen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein's surrogate sister , who at the end becomes his wife for a little while , before death drives them apart  
the rest of the cast , playing secondary characters , is solid and nothing less than convincing  
visually the film is stunning ( especially the makeup )  
the spinning camera , the constantly building-up musical acore , the art direction , the production design , the costumes are all magnificent : from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests , to the plague-riddled streets of ingolstadt , mary shelley's frankenstein is a wonder to behold  
kenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare : ""   all 
i once loved lies in a shallow grave     by 
my hand   ""  
and the film ends exacly as hamlet , when the creature sets both his and his creator's body on fire "

-1,"let's get this one over with as quickly as possible  
if there was a possibility to receive a refund , this review would not be forthcoming  
but as it is , "" godzilla "" is without a doubt the loudest , longest , and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio  
producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves , and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch "" last year at merienbad "" until they can grasp the idea of content and plot  
no amount of hype , no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine ( billy the kid vs  
dracula )  
 "" godzilla "" opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs  
we are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship ( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins )  
well , the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature  
later , a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache ( jean reno ) interview the sole survivor  
in a state of shock , the only thing the man can utter is the word "" gojira "" ( the japanese name of the famed beast )  
we are then introduced to dr  nick tatopoulos ( matthew broderick , with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film )  
he is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population  
he is immediately drafted by the u  s  military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature  
in a short amount of time , another fishing boat ( loaded with canned tuna from the u  s  and korea for some reason ) is found grounded in jamaica  
well , it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york  
when the beast finally appears , he tears up one building , stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert ( thumbs up for new york )  
the military , with dr  tatopoulos's help , have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system  
it finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr  tatopoulos who snaps the beast's picture  
the monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting , and the chase is on , with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage  
working from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple , dr  totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated )  
well the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant  
needless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster's nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city ( even though the monster isn't dead yet )  
i sincerely hope that i've completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film  
i gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour's wage on this tripe  
everything about "" godzilla "" reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast  
the script ( and let's be clear here ) by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years "" razzie "" award  
the dialogue between maria pitillo ( as audrey timmonds , dr  tatopoulos' estranged girlfriend ) and mr  broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed )  
the film could be enjoyably campy if it didn't take itself so damn seriously  
but to what end , as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature , nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind  
no  godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it  
the film is bleak and ugly looking  
taking place at night during a rain storm , the movie has little or no depth  
everything is ugly and dark  
new york has never looked so inhospitable since "" death wish ""  
in an attempt to give the film some color , audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue  
the only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica , where dr  tatopoulos finds himself standing in a giant footprint  
the scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up  
you know from the outset that nick is standing in a footprint  
for a scientist , this is very poor observation  
let's look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film ( this activity , is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game ) : 
1  ) why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs , and how do those eggs fuse into one beast ? 
2  ) why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate ( such as new york ) to nest ? 
i don't think iguana's have a habit of migrating  
3  ) how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system , slice a submarine in half , yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin ( in comparison ) steel cable on the brooklyn bridge ? 
4  ) the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need it's suspension cables  
5  ) did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly ? 
if so , then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures  
 ( note : each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide  
godzilla would have to be over 1 , 000 feet tall to carry them all )  
6  ) godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters , but new york cabs are made of stronger steel  
7  ) godzilla can out maneuver helicopters , bullets , torpedoes and missiles , but can't catch you on foot  
8  ) taxis can out maneuver godzilla  
9  ) godzilla can burrow through the subway system but can't tear through the park avenue tunnel  
10  ) why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla ? 
maybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel  
11  ) galapagos iguana's actually live in the french polynesian islands ? 
12  ) why was dr  tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway ? 
13  ) how did they evacuate new york island in less than a day , and how did they convince those new yorkers to go to new jersey ? 
14  ) new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting  
new yorkers hate beta cam  
i could go on and on , but that would only serve to make the film seem more enjoyable than it is  
don't be fooled , this film has less gray matter than any episode of "" america's funniest home videos ""  
the performances in the film are singularly bland  
not one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror  
the characters , in the midst of the onslaught , have time to stop and discuss the lack of good coffee , failed relationships , career choices  
the only common occurrence that doesn't take place here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement , but then that would have made them believable  
godzilla for the most part is okay  
the design of the beast is funky , if not very memorable  
one thing that comes to mind-- the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark , namely his atomic breath  
now , i for one can't quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait  
a good comparison would be to make a superman film and eliminate his ability to fly  
there is so much wrong with this film that i can't really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted ( except for my divorce ) "

-1,"set in harlem during the great depression , rival gangster "" families "" go to war over control of "" the numbers "" , an illegal gambling lottery  
 "" runners "" take bets from potential lottery winners and deliver them to private locations for drawings  
the undisputed leader of the harlem numbers is the madame queen ( cicely tyson ) who is challenged by dutch schulz ( tim roth ) , a ruthless hoodlum  
by turning against the queen , dutch defies his partner , the infamous lucky luciano ( andy garcia ) , who wishes to respect the queen and keep the peace  
the queens' army strengthens when an acquaintance , ellsworth "" bumpy "" johnson ( lawrence fishburne ) is released from prison and becomes a bodyguard for her  
he proves himself worthy in short time as he thwarts an assassination attempt ( on himself and the queen ) , and later takes control of the queens army when she is jailed for tax evasion  
bumpy's reign is not as restrained and subdued as the queen and he declares all out war on dutch  
bloody gang warfare ensues  
bumpy faces many obstacles during his reign  
his new army questions his methods  
his girlfriend ( vanessa l  williams ) and the queen disagree with his violent solutions  
most importantly ( in his eyes ) , dutch has become a more formidable foe than he imagined , and seeks help from lucky luciano to assassinate him  
there have been so many movies dealing with organized crime that it must be hard to write an original story dealing with it  
this movie is not original at all  
in fact , i was angered by how many similarities there was between this film and , arguably , the best gangster movie of all time , the godfather  
if you are going to borrow ideas from another movie and not give credit , why not borrow from a lesser known movie ( say , millers crossing ? )  
how could the credited screenwriter chris brancato not give credit to mario puzo himself ? 
here are just some of the major similarities ( i stopped counting at 10 )  
crooked cop assaults blood relative of the leader  
gang extracts revenge on crooked cop  
wife ( or girlfriend ) questions her partners' murderous activities and leaves him  
high ranking "" officer "" betrays the leader  
blood relative of the leader murdered  
war erupting between the "" families ""  
high-ranking officer disapproves of the leader in front of other family members  
new leader runs family differently from previous leader  
large meeting with all families involved  
the setup in this movie is done rather well  
i enjoyed the portrayal of the network of "" runners "" sprinting through the streets collecting bets for the queens lottery  
this was the way of life in harlem , and most people involved with the queen did so because it was the only way to support their families and put food on the table  
number running was the only way for the harlem population to find work  
i also enjoyed the interaction between the angry , violent dutch and the calm , patient lucky  
after about the 30-40 minute mark all of the similarities with the godfather start appearing , one after the other ( and in short order )  
it was a huge distraction , and an insult to my intelligence  
who was the screenwriter kidding here ? 
some of the individual performances were well done  
andy garcia was very convincing as lucky , unfortunately his screen time is reduced to a supporting role  
tim roth effectively plays the cocky villain , much like his roles in "" the cook , the thief , his wife and her lover "" and "" rob roy ""  
the good performances and convincing setup during the first third of the movie do not make up for the lackluster story that follows  
a couple of coincidences is one thing , over a dozen is an insult  
directed by bill duke 
ellsworth bumpy johnson        lawrence 
fishburne dutch schultz             tim 
roth lucky luciano           andy

-1,"what's to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornography--ie  
the garbage known as "" snuff "" films ? 
nothing , right ? 
what's to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography ? 
well    nothing  
so , why make it , hollywood ? 
there's no reason why the average , sane movie-goer will be interested in such a topic  
no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this  
the lack of quality filmmaking in "" 8mm "" ( from technical to acting ) stands out even more when you consider the star , writer , and supporting cast--all reputable  
but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again ! 
like paul schrader , schumacher has his moments , but they're few and far ( far ! ) 
between  
basically , this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it  
why not walk out ? 
well , this wouldn't be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie  
here's why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of "" 8mm ""    
first thing--if you don't heed my advice , then understand what you're about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud  
it's not easy to watch  
i didn't know the details of the story beforehand , but at least my ignorance can help others now  
the ( ha ! ) plot revolves around tom welles ( nicolas cage ) as a surveillance expert and private investigator  
a rich old woman discovers a "" snuff "" film in her late husband's safe  
she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl ( it had to be a young girl , didn't it , schumacher ! ) who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead  
she's horrified that her husband would have owned such a film ( in 8mm , of course ) and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find  
family-man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque "" murder ""  
let me backtrack for a moment  
see , "" snuff "" films are pornos with a violent twist--people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead  
however , the deaths are often staged and , in those cases , special effects and "" good "" acting make all the difference  
very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard-to-find movies  
the thought of this "" industry "" makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review , but i'll swallow my bile and move on  
welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry  
you'd think he's sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him ! 
he comes across smut clerk max ( joaquin phoenix ) who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze  
after a lot of digging and bribing , welles finds the men who are responsible for making this , and other , "" snuff "" films  
skip ahead , skip ahead , skip ahead    
led by dino velvet ( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance ) and star-torturer "" machine "" ( christopher bauer ) , they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue  
the movie doesn't end there , unfortunately , because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films do--become a vigilante  
this film doesn't draw you in  
it keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close ? 
it is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ( ie  
 "" se7en "" ) , but it takes a large measure of restraint ( schumacher has none ) and a larger amount of talent ( schumacher has little )  
by those jabs , i'm not only referring to his stylish destruction of the "" batman "" franchise , but "" a time to kill "" was an immensely overrated disappointment  
for a guy who gets so much studio money , his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled  
a good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter  
writer andrew kevin walker didn't recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for '95s twisted thriller , "" se7en ""  
director schumacher doesn't have that innate ability to make you watch things you don't really want to see like better directors are capable of doing  
he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don't see is more frightening than what we do ( especially when it's a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered )  
however , gratuitous is joel's middle name  
he must think that not flaunting a hard-core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint  
no , he doesn't go that far , but we see enough unpleasantness  
he doesn't leave much to the imagination  
it's manipulating to hurt ( or kill ) young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante  
the script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters , yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ( ha ha ! ) 
craft  
case in point , a shot of a christian fellowship bus ( good , right ? ) 
drives away to reveal one of the villains ( bad , right ? )  
see    no 
subtlety  
does joel think we're stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery ? 
who do we root for in this mess ? 
is there anybody out there ? 
it's not all the director's fault , though  
why did the actors sign up for this ? 
nicolas cage is an oscar-winner , for cryin' out loud ! 
if he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money , what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda ? 
what is cage supposed to be in this movie--a whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears ? 
villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy  
and what is james gandolfini doing in this trash ? 
he was so solid as a concerned father in "" a civil action ""  
i guess ol' nic , pete , and jim were promised a mountain of money    or 
they're suckers  
or they just don't care  
there are moments ( albeit brief ones ) where this rises above the wasteland  
catherine keener is good ( although too quick to threaten divorce ) as mrs  wells  
baby cindy is obviously cute and wells' devout love of his daughter is sweet  
the mother ( amy norton ) of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter  
this film has an appropriate blue-toned , washed-out look like "" payback "" ( which was a much better movie )  
the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue , but at other times it's rough  
during some conversations , close-ups and wide shots are not cut very well , making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren't good and whose timing was a half-second off  
such a technical error indeed stands out  
speaking of standing out , don't believe the misleading trailers  
there's not much action here  
occasionally , yes , but not as often as your tv will have you believe  
after seeing "" 8mm "" , i may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again  
is that a positive ? 
well , if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive , they've done a swell job here  
it'll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chance--unless i lose my mind and become seriously depraved  
but today i'm not depraved , so i ask , why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it ? 
i'm sure that somewhere right now there's some pretty sick crap going on , but that doesn't mean i need to know about it  
yes , mr  walker , your script tells us that there are some screwed-up folks out there  
yes , mr  walker , the proverbial monster doesn't look like we expect him to  
you said all that in 1995  
move on  
this film serves no purpose  
it doesn't entertain , it doesn't teach us anything , it doesn't make a statement beyond the obvious "" this stuff is bad "" approach  
only if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile  
that's not likely to happen , though , so "" 8mm "" is indeed a scummy waste of money  
orson welles said years ago in a tribute to film , "" to movies  "

-1,"welcome to your oh-so typical sequel  
it tries to be twice as big as it's predecessor , yet ends up twice as shallow  
shallow     hmm    now there's an idea  
maybe if the ill-fated cruise liner in this movie had struck a shallow reef early on things may have turned out better  
the first thing that struck me    and 
surprised me , was that the camera work ( for the opening sequence anyway ) was terrible  
looked like the cameramen were drunk and kept tripping on their own feet       very 
different to the original movie  
the characters ? 
well , not many of the characters actually * had * characters , but here's a rundown  
annie , who was the highlight of the the original , must have seriously banged her head in the train crash at the end of the first movie  
why ? 
because something's got to account for her losing that many iq points  
even though annie wasn't exactly a rocket scientist in speed , here some of her actions just make you want to beat your head against a wall  
for instance , after successfully using a chainsaw to cut a hole in a door so that a group of people can escape noxious gases - she stands in the middle of the opening for about five minutes till someone reminds her that the people can't get ut till she get's the chainsaw out of their faces     bang 
bang bang 
in point of fact sandra's character is turned into little more than one of those scantly dressed extras from hercules , who constantly has to be rescued  
jason patric ? 
all i can say is bring back keanu  
keanu reeves might have the emotional range of a tree stump    but 
that's one more tree stump than jason has  
i don't think he changed facial expressions all movie - jason , smile for the cameras ! ! 
now frown !    i said frown     oh    you are    bang 
bang bang   
wooden just doesn't describe this guys performance , but it'll have to do  
the bad guy      ahh    william 
dafoe - there's a bright move  
how can you go wrong with the star from that acknowledged classic , body of evidence ? 
 ( yes , that is sarcasm )  
his wide eyed maniac of a character doesn't start out too bad     but 
goes steadily downhill as the movie progresses  
in the end he degenerates to chasing annie around for a hostage , even though he already has the money and can escape     bang 
bang  
though i'd like to give this movie a double thumbs down , there were some nice sequences  
considering the movie cost over 100 million dollars - you'd hope there'd be at least a couple  
the real eye-popper for me , even though it was given away in the trailer     bang 
bang      was the sequence where the cruise liner sideswipes the oil tanker  
this looks terrific and i was very surprised to hear that the cruise liner in it was     completely

the x-files is noteworthy for being the only movie based on a television series to be produced while the series was still running  
in comparing the movie and television series certain aspects of the respective media emerge  
the avoidance of the series to answer the questions it raised annoyed and frustrated many people  
however , i rather liked that about the series  
television allows you to impose as much , or as little , meaning on a show as you want  
it is the proverbial "" blank screen "" which we project our minds on  
meaning on television is open and ambiguous ; it is the nature of the medium  
cinema , on the other hand , is the opposite  
it projects onto us the filmmakers mind  
we can , in some films , fill the textual gaps ourselves , but that almost never happens in an american film  
meaning , in cinema , needs to be self-contained and determined  
so , when the x-files made that jump from small to big screen , carter needed to take into consideration the differences in the medium as well  
he did not  
by making explicit , what the television show left implicit , carter reveals the limits of his creativity and skill  
when they say that "" fans "" make a tv show , it is not far from the truth  
on television , fan culture must impose its meanings on the text because there is nothing there  
how true that is when we see the "" explicit "" x-files - there is nothing there

i guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in a row ( following hideaway and nine months )  
that's about all i saw before the big fight began and , let me tell you , that was twice as interesting as the movie itself  
but like i said , i saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization  
none of these movies ever handle the subject properly , instead introducing the feeble beauty and the beast copout of having a beautiful woman fall in love with the guy's personality , overlooking his personal appearance  
i already had the female character picked out ( the girl who was sitting next to him in the back of the room during the electrocution scene ) , but i guess i'll never know for sure what happened

the lawyer , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is not offered a job yet , he is asked to simply pick a jury  
he accepts  
the jury he selects work out well and before long he is offered a job with the firm  
making his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money , but a gorgeous apartment  
he convinces his wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) to make the move to new york  
the first case given to him is a big test ; a "" winless "" case concerning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement  
the charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal  
his new boss and partner in the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing , explaining many of his philosophies on law , women and sex , and angles the promise of a blissful , wealthy life  
kevin's next case is a dream case , given to him by milton himself ( much to the chagrin to his colleagues ) , defending a triple murder suspect who has had a history of problems with the law  
although kevin's career is taking off , his home life is not doing very well  
mary ann is starting to have numerous problems  
she is experiencing severe depression over kevin's long hours , and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls , their faces becoming horribly disfigured  
kevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife  
he does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with , then focus all of his attention on his wife  
not helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer ( connie nielson ) also working with the firm  
mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home  
kevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife , and gets disturbing news from his mother ( judith ivey ) about the mystery concerning the identity of his father  
he also starts to lose control of his case  
kevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man  
that man is his boss , mr  milton , a truly evil character who just may be the devil himself  
kevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store  
but how do you defeat the devil ? 
why is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd ? 
do filmmakers really believe that "" normal "" courtroom drama doesn't fit the bill and they have to juice them up ? 
the courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in a real courtroom , which wouldn't have been too bad if it weren't keanu reeves trying to pull it off  
i give reeves credit for trying hard , but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character , just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short  
charlize theron defines the term "" over-the-top "" in her performance as mary ann lomax , a disappointment in contrast to her good performance in "" 2 days in the valley ""  
the only good performance in the movie is by al pacino , but i kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess ? 
maybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil , and you can tell he is having fun doing so , but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him  
it's pretty standard stuff , including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom  
please read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled , but i have to get something off of my chest  
in 1986 i remember watching a movie called "" wisdom "" with emilio estevez and demi moore , and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do  
what i like to call "" guess what , it was all a dream "" scenario  
in "" wisdom "" the two lead characters are killed at the end , only to have one of the characters "" wake up "" from an apparent and say "" gosh , i'm glad that didn't really happen ! ""  
i considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with  
well , the same thing happens in "" the devils advocate "" , and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream ( perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan , since it failed and he is the devil ) , but the point is that the last 90% of the film didn't happen  
i know it's a stretch , after all it is a movie and nothing really happened , but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that  
of course , the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one  
as i recall , "" wisdom "" was a decent film  
 "" the devil's advocate "" is not  
the devils advocate

 "" it's just    
the way    
we are  "" 
--- a rapist ( matt frewer ) responds to supergirl's ( helen slater ) query as to why she's being attacked , an example of the mind-numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl  
i'll admit it    
i love superman iii  
i know it's hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor , but i still think it's a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise  
supergirl , a spin-off film of sorts from the series' same producers ( alexander and ilya salkind ) , doesn't even rival superman iii in terms of quality , let alone superman or superman ii  
supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time  
as the film begins we see the residents of argo city , a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in "" inner space "" , go about their daily lives  
ok    
what ? 
so these are exiles from krypton , which blew up right ? 
were they living there before krypton exploded ? 
how do you get to "" inner space "" ? 
this whole "" inner space "" notion is never explained , particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world  
how do they know where superman went ? 
how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ? 
these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me  
argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron  
one day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o' toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman's cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art  
kara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of "" whatever "" that protects the city  
in the chaos , the omegahedron sails out through the opening , dooming the argonians to death    
in three days time , or something  
kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world  
the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who , immediately before her dip was ruined , announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook )  
selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination  
selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she's arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume )  
supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives  
ok    
huh ? 
why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ? 
attention movie : explain yourself ! 
i'm sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much  
i can't buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to  
knowing that she needs a secret identity , supergirl basically "" wills "" herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle ) , picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school  
she's given her dorm assignment , and who happens to be her roommate ? 
lois lane's sister , lucy  
ok , coincidence is one thing folks , but we're getting really contrived now  
what follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks    
complete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason , of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! )  
best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks  
at this point i'm rapidly wondering why i'm bothering with this nonsense  
there is some credit to give to the film however  
one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an "" evil "" bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its "" prey "" is very well done  
also , its commendable to see genders reversed in the film , whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools  
hart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara's love interest , a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film's more ridiculous moments , when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some "" menacing "" bumper cars )  
then there were numerous little things that bothered me  
the flying effects are never convincing for a moment    
it's all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires  
instead of having her look like she's flying , the filmmakers wanted her to be "" graceful "" , so she poses a lot and does ballet-type maneuvers  
also , who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth ? 
a pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a "" wacky "" demise  
there is also some rampant product placement in the film , most notably for popeye's , tylenol , and a&w root beer , with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? ! )  
finally , just one word : monsters  
faye dunaway and peter o'toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o'toole overacts he's entertaining and when dunaway does it she's annoying ( her character actually says the line "" seize them ! "" 
at one point )  
dunaway's henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty's otis character from the first two superman movies  
helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she's written to be , as she's able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable  
believability aside though , it's still annoying  
now despite all this negativity ( and i'm not alone here    supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd ! 
they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself    
yet i'm still unclear as to why , since this movie is so awful )  
the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u  s  theaters  
the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2  35 : 1 , is enhanced for 16x9 televisions , and has been remastered in full thx glory  
extras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and "" special project consultant "" scott michael bosco , the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! ) , 5 trailers , 3 tv spots , talent bios , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie ) , and assorted still galleries  
the transfer on this international version is incredible    
you'd think you were watching a new release  
images are sharp , colors jump off the screen , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts  
only some special effects sequences show the wear of time , and there just isn't much that can be done about that ( unless you're obsessive like george lucas )  
the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places , however you'll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to john williams' classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films' golan-globus production )  
the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries  
bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there's no dead air on the track  
bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation  
although , at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc , and is surprised when he doesn't get that response  
we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track , most notably the "" almost "" appearance in the film by christopher reeve  
great detail is given about superman's proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out  
as it stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission "

-1,"warning : spoilers are included in this review    
but it doesn't really make much of a difference  
deep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997  
remember when dante's peak came out in february ? 
a few months later , volcano was released  
the first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen  
the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent  
well , it's deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition  
this time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july  
of course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante's peak  
but while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film  
apparently many did , and it utterly baffles me  
to be completely honest , i haven't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life  
volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch  
deep impact doesn't just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot  
the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters  
deep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 )  
a line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above  
among these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski )  
leo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds  
he races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident  
a year passes , and nothing is heard about it again  
we are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc  
she gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell )  
she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie  
after talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help  
luckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain "" ellie "" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film    
that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled )  
before she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road  
they take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman )  
beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference  
naturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question  
and so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive  
they announce a plan called "" ark , "" which is their only hope for survival  
a computer will select 800 , 000 people at random  
these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won't kill off the entire human race  
after two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over  
the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning  
jenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom  
the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional  
it's a shame that nothing else is heartfelt  
now , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface  
the title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it ! 
by doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won't work  
director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show "" er  "" 
her major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film  
well , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one  
suggestion to ms  leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre  
much of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off  
throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours )  
it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it's that boring  
of course , leder isn't all to blame for it  
screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time  
what starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway )  
chock full of cheesy one liners ( "" you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! "" ) 
and stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again  
only one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring  
and the main plot is so outrageous that you can't figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi  
to put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation  
that's right , 80% miss , and 20% hit  
scenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic  
but the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening  
the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that's forgiveable  
what isn't forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface  
give me a break , will ya ? 
and of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth  
well , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant  
the water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous  
cgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks  
in fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days  
just when we think visual effects can't be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be  
one thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder's direction , which also influences the actors  
leder loves to show the actors' faces before and during moments of terror  
this reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger )  
but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations  
leder likes to flaunt people's fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist  
one moment has an astronaut flying off into space  
this should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person's face while drifting into space  
this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled  
on another note , leder's film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts  
the pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown  
then again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it's obvious it will be emotional  
it's mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into "" feeling "" for the characters , but it didn't work for me  
but anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given  
t ? a leoni ( bad boys , tv's "" the naked truth "" ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role  
her character is made stronger by leoni's presence , and we grow to care for her  
robert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot  
elijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still hasn't had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama ! 
you are too talented for this stuff )  
vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen  
maximilian schell is distracting , but he does provide some nice humor "

-1,"the last line ( or near to that honor ) is the great butler , alfred ( the ubergod , michael gough ) saying , "" i think we need a bigger bat cave , "" or something to that note  
that's exactly what this film is - too big for its own good because it has too damn much  
cut batgirl out  
cut one of the villains  
it's too much to handle in one dosage  
it's so much that characters get left behind  
poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way , shape or form  
and elle deserves better  
this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher  
it's also the fourth worst in the series ( and second worst from joel )  
the series has been declining since its stunning debut , followed by the almost-as-stunning sequel and then the anti-climactic third one ( first by joel )  
this one's not anti-climactic - i knew it was gonna suck  
it's up to joel to make it fun though  
 "" batman forever "" was fun  
this is a big bore of over-produced action sequences and shallow characters  
i mean , this one bit  
i'm gonna put all the plot in one paragraph : mr  freeze ( ah-nold ) , who's wife was dying of some disease , has become the new big villain these days  
he's a huge ex-scientist who fell into some weird liquid ( hello ? 
joker ? ) and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body  
batman ( george ) and robin ( chris ) fight him a bit but find they're growing apart  
meanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he's used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had  
she emerges from her chemicals ( don't ask 'cause i can't tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who's poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people  
she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo  
meanwhile , alfred's dying of the same disease mr  freeze's wife has ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and his niece , barbara ( alicia ) , comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not really soon , it takes her 2 hours ) becomes batgirl  
meanwhile , in an unfinished subplot , bruce ( batman's alter-ego , if you forgot ) has been dating the lovely julie madison ( the even lovlier elle macpherson ) who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing  
end of her for all we know  
mr  freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population ( don't ask ! ! ! )  
the trio must team together "" as family "" to beat them  
there ya go  
not the whole story but no big context clues  
too much , right ? 
right ! 
the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels  
however , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one  
he gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that's it  
maybe some stunts  
for all this , i can't even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy ! 
and when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say  
i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode  
george is in between them  
he's not quintessential , he's not horrible , he's good  
but i'm sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they'll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we'll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job )  
the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher  
last time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey  
this time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain ( the same guy ) , mr  freeze  
we feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants ? 
arnold isn't very good - too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points  
when he watches old movies of his wife , he actually looks somber  
wow  
but uma makes the most of her seductive character , getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness  
it's like she's almost parodying herself in "" pulp fiction "" at points  
she's incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better  
as for the lower bat-people , chris is the same as he was in "" batman forever , "" although i think his work in these is too hokey when he's best at quieter parts in "" scent of a woman "" or just plain cool parts in "" fried green tomotoes  "" 
alicia - i love the girl but she's not particularly good in this film  
she can hypotheitically act , we all saw that in "" clueless , "" but her lines kinda sound weird  
and it isn't the mushy-mouth this time  
but in all fairness , she has virtually no part  
joel gets around to her occasionally and when she's on , she does stupid stuff    although 
i know i'm not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma    
and poor elle  
poor , poor elle  
i love that woman and she can also hypothetically act ( for those of us who saw "" sirens "" )  
but she has no part ! ! ! 
it seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product  
there are no "" couch "" scenes ( like my best friend noticed )  
now listen to me on this one - in every "" batman "" flick , there's a couch scene  
in the original , it was with vicki  
in "" returns , "" it was a good make-out scene with selena  
and in the last one , it was a chat with nicole  
this one , it's nothing  
and batgirl does next-to-nothing in this film till the end when she's suddenly "" part of the family  "" 
fortunately , we get a lot of alfred  
he's the always reliable butler , in case you didn't know , who has been with bruce all his life  
he's a god  
he's a father figure  
he's also dying  
this got to me  
i love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe , not in his tux , and freaking dying just gets to me  
we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time    but 
this is never answered , as this film is too cluttered  
but in defense , it does have some good parts , other than uma  
for one , george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do  
and there are some nice touches  
when they show the asylum at one point , they show the patient's belongings in a room and we see the riddler's costume  
i laughed  
and during a biker scene ( involving robin and batgirl - another subplot never handled past initiation period ) , we not only see coolio but a bunch of bad-asses dressed as "" droogs "" from "" a clockwork orange  "" 
i laughed at all these "

-1,"godzilla is a nuclear freak  
he is a lizard that has been mutated over the years and has become a new species , one that has a foot as long as this bus , and a claw as long as this sign  
this aquatic creature made its first attack in the pacific islands  
he tore up a ship that carried dozens of japanese men  
one survived  
only he was left to recount the terror that he had seen  
he was merely able to repeat the words "" godzilla    godzilla    godzilla ""  
the film then introduces us to matthew broderick , a biologist who has been studying the fascinating growth of chernobyl earthworms  
 "" they're 17% larger than they used to be ! "" he proclaims  
the u  s  military pulls him off this three year project and assigns him to figure out what godzilla is  
and , boy , does he find out  
and , boy , does godzilla suck  
i hate to use such a word in a review , something that is supposed to inform my audience , but i really need to drive this one home and i refuse to use explitives  
it is unbelieveable to me how the producers of this movie saw the final cut and said , "" ok ! 
it's great ! 
let's show this puppy  "" 
roland emmerich needs a good horse whipping  
his latest piece of trash makes id4 look like a masterpiece of modern american cinema  
and if steven spielberg had never made the jurassic park films , emmerich and his team of talent-challenged imbeciles would never have had a clue as to how the creature should look  
let me give you a few examples of this terrible attempt at filmmaking  
i plan on giving some things away here  
belive me , godzilla holds no surprises for anyone with an iq higher than their shoe size , so    no 
worries  
however , if you are looking for that "" first time thrill "" and you refuse to let me do you this favor , by all means , stop reading now  
a  ) godzilla makes his first ever attack in the pacific islands  
he next strikes in new york city  
um    anyone have a map handy ? 
b  ) the mayor of new york city is a heavy set individual with parted gray hair and thick glasses  
his name is mayor ebert  
his assistant is named gene  
gene gives ebert a thumbs down at the end of the film  
i couldn't make this up if i tried , folks  
c  ) stay with me on this one    
ok  
godzilla can out run torpedoes  
hank azaria can out run godzilla babies  
 ( which look more like jurassic park raptors than the jurassic park raptors  ) 
d  ) the u  s  military , upon realization that godzilla has disappeared after running rampant through the city , decides that he "" might be hiding in a building  "" 
e  ) ( oh yeah , i can go all the way to e  ) godzilla strikes at manhattan  
manhattan , an island approximately the size of san francisco holds three million people  
they evactuate to new jersey in about one day  
no problem  
f  ) early on , they bait godzilla with fish  
 ( he likes fish , you know  ) 
the thing is on an island  
the atlantic ocean is three steps east , but pile a whole bunch of grouper on fifth and 57th    oh 
he's gonna come running  
g  ) you know what ? 
i'll stop with the list now    the 
alphabet isn't big enough anyway  
the dialogue makes me wonder if producer dean devlin had his five year old do a re-write  
 "" the kid is good ! "" he must have said  
maria pitillo is looking to become a name in hollywood by starring in this potential blockbuster  
bad move , maria  
acting doesn't get much worse than her turn as broderick's ex-flame  
matthew broderick is a good actor , but you'd never give him a chance if godzilla were the only film of his you'd seen  
jean reno needs to pick his american films a bit more carefully  
at times , godzilla seems to be headed toward a zucker , abrahams , zucker film  
 ( airplane ! , naked gun  ) 
the jokes are indeed that bad  
but just when you think the filmmakers are having fun with you , they take themselves seriously  
how dare they ! 
godzilla would have been better if it had only thrown in visual sight gags and fart jokes  
at least then we would know we were supposed to laugh  
each and every character in godzilla is beyond stupid and i was really pulling for the beast to kill more of them  
emmerich did do one thing , though  
 ( and i've no idea if it was intentional "

-1,"kate ( jennifer aniston ) is having some problems  
it appears the twenty-eight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder , and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired  
she learns that her problems are related , as the owner of her advertising agency , mr  mercer ( kevin dunn ) , explains to her that her single status does not bode well with the company  
her freedom would make her more likely to leave the company , taking clients with her  
a solution presents itself in nick ( jay mohr ) , a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coincidence and gets photographed with  
kate's boss , darcy ( illeana douglas ) , uses the photograph to fabricate a wedding engagement between kate and nick  
kate is at first repulsed by the idea , but after getting immediate positive results , she pursues it  
her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan  
the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc ?  
at a dinner with kate's bosses he will provoke a fight and they will break up  
she meets nick to propose the plan  
he accepts  
kate's new status brings unexpected results in other areas  
the office bad boy , sam ( kevin bacon ) , who wouldn't give kate the time of day , now does  
now that she is engaged , he pursues an affair with her , as doing so would destroy her good girl image , hence sam's sudden interest  
things start to fall apart for kate , as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her , and does not wish to break up with her  
after some provoking nick does oblige , but problems continue for kate  
it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available  
or maybe kate does like nick , but "" reconciliation "" will force her to admit her lies to her employer  
adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother ( olympia dukakis ) , who wants her to get married and settle down  
there is a scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is ( from the waist up ) only wearing a bra  
it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one  
there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer  
it's like the director said 'well , we know the story is formulaic and the performances aren't that great so , what the heck , let's show jennifer's assets as often and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating  "" 
quite frankly it's insulting  
i don't think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie  
she did a decent enough job in ed burns' "" she's the one "" because it was a smaller and supporting role , and she just doesn't deliver the goods effectively in this movie  
her performance was not convincing  
unfortunately , as far as romantic comedies go , this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies  
the film is similar to "" my best friends wedding "" in a sense that the leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her actions , gets no sympathy from me when things go awry  
i didn't care for how quickly kate puts down nick's profession by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn't glamorous enough for her co-workers  
at least "" my best friends wedding "" changed the formula a bit and had a somewhat surprise ending  
no such luck with "" picture perfect ""  
every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away , including a couple that really made no sense  
after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company , why would she blindly throw it all away when she should have made sure that nick would even talk to her first , let alone consider a relationship ? 
was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick ? 
throw in the fact that i don't think nick and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of a decision  
i believe that kate liked him , but liked him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away ? 
i doubt it  
and what of the ending scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the couple ? 
are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers ? 
well , i guess of the congregation consists of movie extras and the strangers are the movies two lead stars , then that would make sense  
picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron
