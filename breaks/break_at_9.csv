1,"wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon , denise richards , and neve campbell that deals with all the issues ; sex , love , murder , and betrayal  
the setting of the film is a town named blue bay  
it consists of many swamps and slums and , on the other hand , rich estates owned by the town's different benefactors  
the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town's ritzy , expensive high school  
it is here that we meet all of the core characters  
there's guidance counselor sam lombardo , police officers ray duquette and gloria perez , dark mysterious senior suzie toller , and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan  
we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor , but none more than kelly  
throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape  
shortly after , suzie , too , confesses that sam raped her as well "

in fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film  
however , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot  
in doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker  
unfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film  
but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head  
one surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script  
action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence

he and his dim-witted brother jacob ( thorton ) and tubby friend lou ( brent briscoe ) come upon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck  
against his better judgement , hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities  
the rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a secret , and is it worth it ?

1,"uncompromising french director robert bresson's "" lancelot of the lake "" achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory's "" morte darthur  "" 
instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table , it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak , ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous , bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them  
chivalry has no place in "" lancelot of the lake , "" except as that of a dying ideal  
bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning , decimated , after failing merlin's command to retrieve the holy grail , the mystical cup that was filled with christ's blood  
bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest : bloodshed and failure  
the opening sequence is a series of clumsy , disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights -- a head is hacked off , a stomach is impaled , a skull is split open , skeletal remains hang from trees , and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house  
since the film starts with camelot in near-ruin , and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion , it doesn't carry the grand , tragic resonance of other arthurian films  
we never get to see camelot at the peak of its power , therefore there is no real downfall to witness  
but , then again , it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film "
1,"bob the happy bastard's quickie review : 
the mummy 
brendan fraser's stuck in the past again , but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone    
fraser is the lead star of the mummy , the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers ( who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising )  
it's a rough adaptation of the 1932 film , and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages , like boris karloff was engulfed in  
but who cares , the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can't get from , oh , say , godzilla or armageddon  
fraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground  
basically , it's a little sign from the mummy buried underneath- a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress

the story takes place in the early 1950s in the small town of petaluma , california , where charles heads to avoid the police

1,"eyes wide shut isn't the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick's final film , but it is an impressive achievement ; a mesmerizing , haunting , adult psychodrama about marriage , fidelity and sex  
it's a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end , consistently exhibiting the auteur's trademark penchant for long , continuous takes , his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast ( indeed , eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot : kubrick , a renowned perfectionist , reportedly held his cast "" hostage "" on the set for nearly a year )  
in an uncharacteristic maneuver , kubrick cast two big-name stars in the lead roles , namely real-life husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman

be forewarned  
it's startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth  
the lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast  
since then , though , disney's animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year's hercules successively proving less and less potent  
with the once seemingly-impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox's anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation , the little mermaid  
while the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top-notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music  
the film's storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince

based on the 1959 television show of the same title , "" the untouchables "" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script  
the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public  
elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order

in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his "" giallo "" murder mysteries  
while it's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller  
the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book "" tenebrae ""  
with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems  
the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa

1,"niagara niagara ( r ) bob gosse's niagara niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of young-lovers-on-the-road movies  
wild marcy ( robin tunney ) and calm seth ( henry thomas ) meet cute , literally running into each other while shoplifting at a local store  
a mere couple of scenes later , the two embark on a journey to toronto from their small , unnamed american town in pursuit of a rare doll that marcy desperately wants  
along the way , true love inevitably blossoms  
what sets niagara niagara apart , though , is that marcy is afflicted with tourette's syndrome , a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle and vocal tics  
tunney , displaying an acting range not hinted at in the teenage witch thriller the craft , delivers an astonishing performance that won her the best actress prize at last year's venice film festival  
to term her work a tour-de-force is not to imply that she attacks the scenery ; tunney's effectiveness lies in her modulation and vulnerability , which makes her depiction of marcy's illness--which often causes her to act violently--that much more convincing and tragic  
she and the nicely subtle thomas develop a sweetly innocent and beguilingly off-kilter chemistry  
their journey hits a few rough spots creatively along the way , mostly the fault of writer matthew weiss "
1,"ingredients : man with amnesia who wakes up wanted for murder , dark science fiction city controlled by alien beings with mental powers  
synopsis : what if you woke up one day , and suspected you were not on earth , and instead were part of an experiment in a giant space terrarium manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers ? 
in dark city john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) has this problem  
dark city starts out like a 1940s noir amnesia detective mystery  
poor john wakes up with amnesia in a hotel room with a dead dame in one corner  
a mysterious phone call tells him to get the heck out of there , and soon enough john is chased all over town by a murderous army of pale people in black trench-coats , as well as by the police , and the dogged inspector bumstead ( william hurt )  
is john a murderer , and what can his missing memories tell him ? 
he searches through his own wallet for possible contacts and clues  
but when the clues don't fit , it doesn't just confuse him ; it causes john to go so far as to question the whole nature of reality in the dark city  
to john , something is fishy , and very unreal about this city  
how come it's always dark , and nobody seems to remember what they did this morning ? 
and how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city , or how to get to nearby shell beach ? 
every night , around midnight , john notices that the whole city enters a state of suspended animation , and at this time , creepy alien experimenters known as the 'strangers' come out and do nasty things like inject fake memories into people's heads with big hypodermic needles "
1,"what surprises me most about the long-awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker  
the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis ! 
i can hear batfans everywhere protesting : "" first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman , and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker ! ! "" 
and , indeed , this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play  
nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding , oscar-worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman  
nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown ( romero played the joker in the '60s tv series )  
on one hand , nicholson's joker is extremely funny  
his murderous escapades and manic outbursts ( which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts ) bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film  
but on the other hand , his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind  
the joker's cruelty and demented , diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister  
this guy is off his rocker , and he not only knows it , he flaunts it ! 
but enough about nicholson as the joker : i'm sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman "
1," "" a bug's life "" may not be "" toy story , "" but it's more close than "" antz "" was  
i really liked "" antz , "" basically because , yes , it is clever and witty and intelligent ( and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead , perhaps the year's most inspired casting ) , but there was , in fact , something missing from it , and i'm the first to admit that  
maybe it's that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun - it's too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging , and if it weren't for woody allen , it would have been just a really clever good-not-great flick  
 "" a bug's life "" has a similar premise , and it also has disney to insure that it's g-rated and not totally over kids' heads like "" antz "" was ( not a bad thing , believe me ) , but what it also has is a tone that's completely innocent even when it's also remaining perpetually clever  
 "" antz "" is still the more witty film , and i love it for it , and "" a bug's life "" is more for general consumption , but it's also more entertaining  
it broadens its horizons , and when it really moves from the ant colony , it really shows us a whole new world we've never seen before , and it's take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in "" antz  "" 
it's also light and clever  
the visuals are , instead of earth tones , bright worldly colors , and still gives the amazing visual technology of "" antz "" at least a worthy contender  
the characters are also nicely realized - though watered-down for broad consumption , they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films "
1,"as i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film  
with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a "" great "" piece of work and viceversa  
attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs  
i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology  
as the word implies , a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master  
as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality  
crouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category  
crouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology  
it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half-gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats , but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable "
1,"do film critics have morals ? 
are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow ? 
naturally we don't want to go into a film with any preconceived notions , which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish  
secondly , and along the same line , we can't prejudge a film because of it's stars , director , etc  the difference ? 
well , in the first one , we'd go into a film thinking it's going to be dumb or it's going to be good , and that would affect our viewing ( that movie sounds and looks dumb , so i'm not expecting much )  
on the second hand , we're simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal "" grudge "" against the film company ( it's made by disney ? 
oh , it's just a merchandising ploy then ) , the actors ( jim carrey's in it ? 
it's gonna stink ! ) , or the director ( who ? 
can't be that good )  
this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint  
make sense ? 
ok , but what about comparing ? 
isn't that kind of along the same lines ? 
when we compare a certain actor or director or even composer's credibility in one film to another they were involved in , is that really fair ? 
sure , in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more , but what about jackie brown , for example ? 
is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction , just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ? 
i think it is , and i'll tell you why  
a good critic should be able to view the film from the "" average joe ( or jane ) "" viewpoint , while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film  
sometimes that can be tough  
 "" the acting was superb , but i was bored "" or "" i loved it ! ! 
it was sooooo cheezy ! ""

wayne's still hopelessly infatuated with his girlfriend , cassandra , and of course garth is still having his own , personal growing pains  
they guys are just finishing off one of their shows , and head off to an aerosmith concert where they run across cassandra and her new manager , a stereotypical industry slime not unlike the character rob lowe portrayed in the previous film  
again , the promoter is not only after the money that cassandra's talent can bring in  
the storyline quickly degrades to a parallel of the original , "" guy loses chick , guy realizes mistake , and guy gets chick back  "" 
fortunately , there is more to this movie than this somewhat sheer plot  
the wit and humor in this film are surprisingly intelligent and fresh with many inside jokes on the film and music industries as well as just a lot of hilarious scenes of wayne and garth showing their true color  
highlights of the movie include a spoof of jurassic park , garth's seduction by a married woman , a surprise appearance by charleton heston , a 1960's batman setup in the guy's pad , and some pretty groovy chats with jim morrison and some "" naked indian guy , "" an unexpected lip-sync of ymca ( you could see that one coming a mile away ) and of course a hilarious parody of those badly-dubbed kung-fu movies we love to laugh at

10 things i hate about you is an update of the classic play , the taming of the shrew  
that said , drop any pre-conceived notions of what shakespeare's work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to padua high school , home of a student counselor ( allison janney ) who obsesses over the male penis ; a slightly too hip and racist african-american english teacher ( daryl mitchell ) ; a new kid named cameron ( joseph gordon-levitt ) ; a model named joey ( andrew keegan ) , the subject of cameron and joey's crushes ; bianca ( larisa oleynik ) ; and bianca's sister - the shrew ( julia stiles in a marvelous performance ) - whose name is katarina , kat for short  
with movies about high schools similar to these running through projectors like water down the nile , it would be quite easy to write off 10 things i hate about you as just another doltish comedic-romance  
yet , you must realize that the story is timeless , and a few hundred years later it is equally as witty and comical as when elizabeth gleefully looked on , groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage

1,"i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry and chocolate , cuba's oscar nominee for best foreign film , directed by tomas gutierrez alea ( who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo-- "" memories of underdevelopment ""  
i saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in the late '70s ; it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition  
i knew then that memorias was probably a state-sanctioned political missive , and now expect strawberry will follow suit  
fellow internetters , primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba ( soc  culture  cuba ) , have mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of the revolution and its current state of affairs  
i have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party line--it probably looks like political criticism , but it ain't so  
having some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro's repressiveness , i can't conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution , and i can't imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement  
as kids say these days , duh ! , the revolution's current state needs no criticism ; its physical and spiritual crumbling is self evident "

her mast famous episode , "" love's labour lost "" , dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child  
the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing  
there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood's big blockbuster movies  
so it's only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster  
and i have to say , after a shaky beginning , she does not disappoint  
peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists , which is obviously nothing new

1,"steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities , because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits , like jurassic park , and "" oscar "" -awarded critical triumphs like schindler's list  
however , in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories  
one of them is close encounters of the third kind , extremely popular and influential science-fiction spectacle  
unfortunately , it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars  
although both films have a lot in common ( ground-breaking special effects , brilliant score by john williams ) their future was different ; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon , and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow  
when spielberg began work on that project , he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit , jaws  
together with other young directors of his "" new hollywood "" generation , like kauffman , carpenter , hill and millius , he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s , when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment  
ironically , it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of "" blockubuster "" philosophy

1,"while watching "" shallow grave , "" i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens' "" blood simple  "" 
both are good films in which several characters , none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil , indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes  
the body count rises , and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands  
both films are also flawed , but for different reasons  
 "" blood simple "" is unrelentingly dark and moody , but its characterizations were a little hollow  
 "" shallow grave , "" on the other hand , is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes , and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they'd accomplished for a more standard , audience-pleasing ending  
the events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time , yet there was a slight grin on my face at the end

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
among my fanatical ticker tape-worshipping friends , there's one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofsky's darkly original pi : the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing but a series of patterns which , through analysis , will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour  
 ( an example of the mentality involved : if the stock price goes up like this , and then down like that , and then sharply up this way , it then will go * this * way  ) 
while i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market ( knowledge check : prices up -- good ; prices down -- bad ; most of the time , at least ) and hence really couldn't comment with any authority , it's always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system ( and besides , if it were that simple , no doubt somebody would've already figured it all out )  
the difference in this case is that while my colleague ( an otherwise assuredly realistic individual ) truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster , pi uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its character's psychosis  
it's also vastly more convincing with its argument  
 "" mathematics is the language of the universe , "" insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen ( sean gullette ) in a cool , mantra-like voice-over which repeats throughout the picture

great wit , great art , and a great villain ( james woods as hades , lord of the underworld and local lounge act ) can't quite stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero , his colorfully monotonous sidekick ( danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil ) , and a largely unremarkable soundtrack  
 ( none of the alan menken/david zippel tunes are particular- ly noteworthy  
some lack lyrical snap  
others need more memorable melodies  
boring ballads we expect , but boring production numbers , too ? ) 
so , hercules is a bit of a long sit , but you won't stay bored  
the highlights include a nifty round of animated action ( herc battling a cgi hydra ) , a steady stream of anachronisms ( "" somebody call ix-i-i "" ) and pop references ( "" let's get ready to rumble !

1," "" the deep end "" uses a color palette of rich earth tones surrounded by a vast array of blues  
alluring , attractive blues , but also icy and foreboding  
after taking in their beauty , the eye seeks out the reassuring browns and greens , like a tired swimmer searching for the safety of land  
the production works that way as well ? it pulls you in initially as a crisp , thoroughly-modern thriller , with clipped exchanges between defiantly non-communicative characters  
but the real draw of the film is the submerged humanity of two key players as "" the deep end "" gradually reveals the melodramatic core beneath its ironic candy coating

1," ( note : there are spoilers regarding the film's climax ; the election , of course ) 
we see matthew broderick , a man torn to a primal state ; he's been unfaithful to his wife , lied to and manipulated his students , and by the same token they've demeaned his masculinity , his self-respect , his desperate attempt at changing the world  
and yet , he equates the cause of his pain , his torment , with tracy flick ( reese witherspoon )  
no matter how many students have come and gone , and disappointed him as an educator , she's the real threat  
about to give in , and divulge that she's won by only a lone vote , broderick's mccalister turns in defeat , sees tracy's euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says , 'no'  
the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men , no matter how obscure , have in their relationships ; a traditional expectation of success , to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry  
she can't go higher than him  
he won't allow it  
and what's amazing about "" election "" is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor  
early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically , and then sexually , involved with a now departed teacher "

1,"in recent years , harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence , scowling through the likes of tom clancy's jack ryan series , _the_fugitive_ , and last year's smash _air_force_one_ , that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system  
apparently , it was just lying dormant  
with ivan reitman's enjoyable romantic comedy/adventure _six_days , _seven_nights_ , the lovable scoundrel is back , giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons  
ford plays quinn harris , a carefree and slightly slobby ( endearingly so ) pilot in the tropics whose broken-down plane crashes in a storm , stranding him and his charter , new york magazine editor robin monroe ( anne heche ) , on a deserted island  
of course , the sophisticated robin and the salt-of-the-earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down , and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting  
while some of the lines fall flat , the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche  
both actors , who have largely done serious works as of late , seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders , and they deliver their zingers , as weak as they sometimes are , with beguiling abandon  
naturally , there's nothing like a life-threatening crisis to bring two people together , and quinn and robin's warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates  
granted , some conflict needed to be introduced on the island , but this tacked-on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes "
1,"james jones , one of the major novelists from the middle of the twentieth century , has written a number of fictional works about the effects of war on the individual  
a veteran of world war ii , and a witness to the pearl harbor bombings , his novels are not only grounded in realism but poetic in nature  
they are reminiscent of stephen crane in their blunt eloquence , a trait which lends itself to razor-sharp focus  
but perhaps none matches the scope of his autobiographical novel , the thin red line ; now a cinematic masterpiece from director terrence malick  
the book's principal cast , some thirty characters , has been trimmed down for this rendition , but it still retains its most endearing value

1,"oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with !

1,"cinematically speaking , gordon parks' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film  
a bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman's "" black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks "" to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking  
yet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , "" blaxploitation , "" died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness  
the reason for this is the same one that explains the film's connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft  
while the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass  
this fact also explains why john singleton's y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is  
much like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_'s plot doesn't score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers  
contrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff  
the star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972's _shaft's_big_score ! _ and 1973's _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city "

suggested means that irving , author of the acclaimed "" the world according to garp , "" sold the rights to his novel "" a prayer for owen meany "" to the disney machine for $1 million , but wouldn't grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names  
that's an odd decision--irving claims it's to protect both himself and the novel--but it's one that doesn't unduly harm the finished product  
irving's books are rich and complex works , full of intriguing , colorful characters  
 "" a prayer for owen meany "" is no exception ; it tells the story of an unusual boy--called simon birch in the film version--who is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a high-pitched falsetto voice , "" like strangled mice  ""

simon is played by ian michael smith , who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which , among other things , prevents bones , ligaments , and joints from developing normally

yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind  
ralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film  
but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him

this is an insightful , haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director , and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie  
gods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whale's life because it tracks only the final few days of his life , and it's probably a better movie for it

the shot has tibbs' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars

as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent tibbs is , he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin  
the bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is , instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous

1,"the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any man's life , especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances  
thematically in cinema , love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters ; it is rare , however , for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benigni's neo-classic drama , life is beautiful  
through a central cast of father , mother , and son , benigni demonstrates the wonderful , undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times  
life * is * beautiful for guido orefice ( roberto benigni , directing himself here for the sixth time in his career ) , an italian jew , master con man , and aspiring waiter extraordinaire  
living in 1930's italy , he lives a carefree life of good fortune ; it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora ( nicoletta braschi )

unfortunately for the happy family , the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps

1,"some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese's raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the '80s  
since there are still a number of '80s films that i haven't seen , i don't feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i'll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level  
bio-pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry , dull textbook account  
it's rare that a movie with the moniker "" based on the life of ? "" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining  
raging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre  
the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the '40s and '50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen  
for all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying  
historically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion's share of the details culled from la motta's own autobiography ( which was co-written with joseph carter and peter savage )  
however , although la motta is credited as the movie's "" consultant , "" he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout "

a film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson 
this extraordinary re-telling of bram stoker's "" dracula "" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore  
inspired by f  w  murnau's 1922 silent film of the same name , herzog's film is a work of exquisite bleakness , an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards

1,"up until about a year ago , john travolta's career consisted of those "" look who's talking "" movies ( notice how they never called them look who's talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout ( which was bad enough to make most people scream )  
but somewhere along the line , travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again  
weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again , while barry , robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight-to-the-cutout-bin album aptly named "" size isn't everything "" ( and of course , they learned that sales are everything )  
but now travolta's back on the hollywood scene once again , and i think we all know why  
four words : contract with the devil  
and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich's "" contract with america  "" 
no , satan is much more humane

1,"making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed , especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece  
when it comes to living up to expectations , a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure  
for a sequel to live up to or even surpass the original's greatness is very rare indeed  
and whereas "" babe : pig in the city "" misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe , it is a worthy companion piece  
more than that , it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like "" the godfather : part ii "" and "" the empire strikes back "" as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced

1,"i must admit i'm going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity , because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend  
the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity  
i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , but something drew me to this film  
maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role , and the hilarious eugene levy  
maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity , con air , and pushing tin  
but maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life  
the story of serendipity is simple  
two people , john trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale , looking ever so hot ) , have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves -- with buck henry smack dab in the middle  
charmed beyond repair , these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf ? called serendipity , talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down , and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink "
1,"that thing you do ! 
 ( r ) tom hanks's screenwriting and directorial debut , that thing you do ! , has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment : fun , lively , and oh-so-nice  
it is the latter quality , however , that becomes a hindrance , for this '60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast  
that thing focuses on the wonders , a teen rock band from erie , pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called , of course , "" that thing you do ! "" 
the group's members are , naturally a diverse group : there's brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy ( johnathon schaech ) ; girl-crazy lenny ( steve zahn ) , the lead guitarist ; a goofy , geeky type known only as the bass player ( ethan embry ) ; and the film's center , guy ( tom everett scott ) , the drummer who has aspirations in jazz  
along for the wonders' ride to success is jimmy's perpetually neglected galpal , faye ( liv tyler )  
hanks proves to be a capable writer-director , deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964 , which hanks calls "" the last innocent year  "" 
the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music , which , like the other recent period music film , grace of my heart , was expressly written for the film ; hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes--but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger , which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled ( it's still playing in my mind as i write this )  
it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors , eliciting charming , likable work from the entire cast , most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler , who is remarkable in delivering the film's biggest and best dramatic moment  
the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early '60s ; they do not appear to be '90s grungers playacting "" retro  "" 
yet for all the light , frothy charms of that thing you do ! , it's nearly nice to a fault "

while the original alien film was a dark , enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew , james cameron took the big-budget action film with aliens , which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing , although on a much-larger scale

1," "" the faculty , "" the heavily-hyped and advertised sci-fi/horror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez ( 1995's "" desperado "" and 1996's "" from dusk till dawn "" ) and screenwriter kevin williamson ( 1996's "" scream "" and 1997's "" scream 2 "" ) , is being called a cross between "" invasion of the body snatchers "" and "" the breakfast club , "" and i don't think i could describe it any better than that  
the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common , and then the science-fiction aspect is added , involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town  
the six characters , as in "" the breakfast club , "" can be easily labeled as a stereotype , but as they are developed , they become far more complex : casey ( elijah wood ) , the much picked upon nerd ; stokely ( clea duvall ) , a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her ; zeke ( josh hartnett ) , a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz ; stan ( shawn hatosy ) , the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics ; delilah ( jordanna brewster ) , the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist ; and marybeth ( laura harris ) , the sweet 'n southern new girl in town  
although the characters are only slightly connected ( i  e  
casey is delilah's photojournalist assistant ; marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely , since they both don't have friends , etc  ) , when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences , the only people they can count on for help is each other , even though they aren't really even sure if they can trust one another  
 "" the faculty "" is another smart and pop-culturally hip film from williamson , although it does not equal up to his best film , the original "" scream , "" and rodriguez , whose "" from dusk till dawn "" is still one of the more original genre films of the 90's  
williamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions , respectively , that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no-brainer "
1,"anyone who saw alan rickman's finely-realized performances in truly madly deeply and sense and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actor-turned-director is a bit of a poet at heart  
however , for those who recall him only as the maniacal villain of die hard and robin hood : prince of thieves , this recognition may be something of a shock  
nevertheless , "" poetic "" is an excellent term to describe rickman's feature debut as a director , the winter guest  
the film has a simple , unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion a successful whole  
the result is an occasionally haunting , sometimes magical , and always insightful human drama  
the winter guest isn't about resolving plot threads and advancing a story line ; it's about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages  
the winter guest does not tell a traditional tale , nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure ? there is no real beginning or end  
instead , we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eight humans  
they represent both sexes , multiple generations , and a variety of relationships ? male and female ; young , middle-aged , and elderly ; friends , would-be lovers , and kin "

the movie was desperately marketed to the anti-phantom menace crowd , the same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter

1,"steven spielberg's "" amistad , "" which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship , then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who "" owned "" them , is concerned with several different aspects of this story  
first , the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery  
second , it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case , including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins )  
last , and most importantly , it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade  
 "" amistad "" succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements  
i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another "" anti-slavery "" movie  
having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i didn't already know about it  
fortunately , i turned out to be wrong  
for one thing , spielberg's camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders' operations in africa , so "" amistad "" was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning "

with all of the attention thrown to "" family films "" in recent years , namely those starring pocket monsters and nickelodeon characters , it's high time we raised the intellectual level of children's fare as well as the animation achievements of the movie studios  
with that in mind , it was refreshing to revisit an animation classic on the big screen that still retains the originality and freshness it had seven years ago

cast : forest whitaker , henry silva , cliff gorman , john tormey , gene riffini , victor argo , tricia vessey , isaach de bankole' , camille winbush director : jim jarmusch writer : jim jarmusch 
rating : good shot ( stars ) 
languid , yet pointed and focused , ghost dog : the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek , ultra-cool , cinematic image of the hitman  
juxtaposing the samurai's honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the american/italian mafia , it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptor's precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber , dinosaur-like , to function in the modern era  
director jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast , ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit  
using a palate of bleached colors , jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film  
he doesn't cater to audience expectations of hyper-colorized , stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies  
the action is presented in flat , brutal codas  
bullets have permanence  
death has consequences  
the movie rises beyond standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty "
1,"i feel no hesitation in saying that "" there's something about mary "" is the best film that i will see all year  
from the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture , there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998  
it is that good of a film  
when gene siskel said this about "" fargo "" only a few months into '96 , i dismissed the notion as ridiculous  
how could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it ? 
but after seeing the farrelly's hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork , i now know what siskel was talking about  
once in a ( very great ) while , a film comes along that is so daring , so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end , you just want to stand up and cheer  
and you know , at that instant , that you have just experienced something very special  
now for the shocker ; "" mary "" is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed ( "" pink flamingos "" obviously notwithstanding )  
the movie is so rude and , i guess , inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents ( luckily i had seen it before them , so i could warn the about what they were in for ) "
1,"i rented "" brokedown palace "" last night blind , having heard nothing about it beforehand , and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws  
for anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety  
that is no easy task  
superficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably "" return to paradise "" and "" midnight express  "" 
as a result nearly every review of "" brokedown palace "" i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons  
the consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as this is a fine film  
for those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was "" midnight express "" ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of "" return to paradise  "" 
in my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad's acclaimed novel , "" lord jim  "" 
problematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world "" justice "" system "
1,"not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets & lies  
like bergman , director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters' inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations  
also like bergman , leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters' ravished and wracked faces  
and the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman's own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film  
all that is missing is a discussion of god  
which is not to say that secrets & lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master  
in fact , it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind  
nonetheless , what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience -- even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place -- that it takes some effort to adjust to the film's rhythms  
once the adjustment is made , however , there are great rewards "

nello also has a rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen , in either a movie or in real life

i really do like to read , and i've enjoyed many books in my lifetime  
my problem is that i'm a slow reader , and not very dedicated -- i'll enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time ( it's taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina , even though i'm loving the book )  
in addition to this , i typically don't read anything created after the 19th century  
the only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting , time after time , that i haven't read any of the books on which these films are based ( the only exception , i believe , is great expectations )

the supernatural thriller , written and directed by alejandro amen ? bar ( "" open your eyes "" ) , adroitly establishes and maintains a low-key atmosphere of menace  
the cinematography , by javier aguirresarobe , is as good as i have ever seen and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances  
but the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied  
overall , the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old "" twilight zone "" episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented , only to learn they are actually a child's toy , a military test subject or a department store dummy

1,"scream 2 , like its predecessor , is a genre-crossing film  
it is about 50% horror film and 50% murder mystery  
the mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time  
scream was also known for its self-referential tone  
many inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven  
again , scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such things as "" sequels suck "" and "" the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels  "" 
scream 2's story is very similar to it's predecessor's  
sidney ( neve campbell ) , having survived the killing spree in scream , is now in college  
gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a book about the murders and that book is now being released as a feature film , called stab ( which for all practical purposes is the real-world movie scream ) "
1,"it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a less-than-savoury character as mel gibson does in payback  
of course , if i was being paid $25 million for one month's work , i'd probably be willing to take risks as well , but that's neither here nor there  
payback is based on a novel by richard stark ( apparently actually donald e  westlake , author of the grifters , itself a fine crime film ) which was also filmed in the 1960s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys , lee marvin  
the film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back , by whom we don't know yet  
all we know is that gibson , as porter , isn't a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back , and getting even in the process , no matter what the consequences  
it turns out that the man he's after is val ( gregg henry ) , his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters  
obviously not having much of a crisis of the soul , val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers  
porter , however , is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet , goes about exacting revenge on the double-crossing val "
1,"today , war became a reality to me after seeing a screening of saving priivate ryan

1,"harmless , silly and fun comedy about dim-witted wrestling fans gordie and sean ( david arquette and scott caan ) who idolize current world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king ( oliver platt )  
when king is screwed out of his title by a corrupt promoter ( joe pantoliano ) , gordie and sean take it upon themselves to find their fallen hero and restore his glory  
my biggest fear about ready to rumble was dispatched early on , as the filmmakers are quick to show that wresting is indeed choreographed ( but not fake , mind you )  
the hook of the movie is that gordie and sean are just too stupid to realize that  
arquette and caan are suitably over the top with their performances , which is exactly what a movie like this requires , and oliver platt ( one of my favorite actors ) is a riot as the drunken washed-up ex-champion  
many have scoffed at the idea that platt should be playing a heavyweight champion wrestler with an unbeaten record , but for me it just added to the "" silly factor "" of the film , thereby increasing my enjoyment of it  
one casting complaint however : rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer ? 
please   "
1,"we all know the fate of "" child's play , "" which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially : sequel hell  
with the newest installment in the quasi-popular series currently out ( that would be "" bride of chucky "" - and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend , which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five ) , it's kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original , a task which is a retread for some , and for others ( namely myself ) a chance to see what all the fuss was about  
alas , the original "" child's play "" actually isn't that bad  
even seeing it in the tiny , claustrophobic , and mechanically-challenged theatre at my college wasn't the horribly dull experience i thought it would be , not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd ( which you almost need to watch a film like this - and if you don't believe me , try and watch this flick by yourself one day ) , but because as a whole , this isn't a bad movie  
it's not great , but it does have two things that many horror films like this one don't have : 1 ) a rather nifty premise , and 2 ) a sense of humor , both which save this from horror hell , which is precisely where , say , "" i know what you did last summer "" has recently gone  
the premise of "" child's play "" is that a serial killer named charles lee ray ( brad douriff ) is shot and almost killed by a chicago hard-boiled detective ( chris surrandon - see what happens to some oscar nominees ? ) , and before he dies , utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kid's doll called chucky , a doll which has got to be the scariest-looking kid's doll i've ever seen  
the next day , a bum who's stolen it sells it to single-mother karen barclay ( catherine hicks ) , who then gives it to her young son andy ( alex vincent ) for his birthday  
of course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll , but certain twists come up

1,"roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton  
this italian film star , best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther , has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust  
but benigni's life is beautiful ( la vita e bella ) is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love , devotion and sacrifice  
the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni's guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore  
like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him , most notably the almost-forgotten harry langdon , benigni's guido has a childlike innocence  
he ignores the growing anti-semitism of the fascist government  
instead , guido ardently falls in love and persues dora , a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official  
in benigni's tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate - yet slapstick - encounter  
guido wins dora "

1,"the grandfather of italian horror the late mario bava has credits in nearly 100 films and tv movies produced in italy between 1939 and his death in the early 80's  
more practiced as a cinematographer than a director , bava nonetheless sat in the director's chair for beyond the door ii , the project which turned out to be his last full-length feature film  
alongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci , beyond the door ii is simply a revelation  
in his day bava was considered by most to be no great filmmaker , yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the 1970's  
 ( note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcist-rip off behind the door , but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia  ) 
this story focuses on dora , a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco  
the film opens with dora , her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husband's suicide and her subsequent trauma 7 years earlier

1,"jonathan demme's _beloved_ , based on the book toni morrison , is a study in skillful literary adaptation  
on the one hand , the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel , evoking morrison's pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice  
on the other hand , beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book , favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story's main events  
this choice is a smartly made one , for it creates an open space in which the story's wide range of emotions can gestate and grow  
indeed , the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled  
_beloved_ takes place in the second half of the 19th century , during the so-called reconstruction era after the civil war  
for newly-freed slaves , it is a time of confusion and turmoil  
oprah winfrey is sethe , a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse , where she hoped the terror would end

the crime : a young prostitute , elizabeth ( renee zellweger ) , has been brutally slain  
one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station  
the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority , miles away  
the police duo of braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are strapped for leads

1,"contact is the 1997 movie i've seen the most - five times to be exact  
four of those times were on the big screen , but even on a tv , it's a very impressive film  
the same can't be said for films like independance day , but that's because contact is a rare example in sci-fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects , and all of us know looking back that id4 didn't offer much outside of some one-time delightful eye candy  
contact's wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) , a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of "" merely listening "" to sounds out in space  
her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age , encouraged by her loving father , ted ( david morse ) , who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola , fl ( that was , of course , before the days of internet chat rooms )  
while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ( of which the program seti is an acronym for ) , ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on , keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive  
ellie's strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist , a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young  
in puerto rico , she meets palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a writer examining the effects of technology on the world's overall happiness ; a one- time seminary student who describes himself as "" a man of the cloth , without the cloth ""

1,"in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close-up of a blank movie screen at a drive-in  
we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves  
without an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind's eye  
even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema  
but do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ? 
exploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept  
is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ? 
midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth

1,"much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of "" lolita , "" made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made , over its use of pedophilia , and as such , it's important to address it straight-forwardly , before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed , as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years , lying around in vaults san a distributor , and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit

1,"few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parker's adaptation of frank mccourt's memoir angela's ashes  
many dismissed it as an humorless , sentimentalized , uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel ; others hailed it as a heartfelt , sincere portrait of the human spirit  
i'm somewhere in between , leaning strongly towards the latter  
it's certainly well-made and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be  
but i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudo-lyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the two-and-a-half hour running time that screams "" i'm important ! "" 
mccourt's book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900's , a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us  
as he comments , "" we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty  "" 
in ireland , frank ( played by joe breen as a small child ) , his 3 brothers , his mother angela ( emily watson ) and his father malachy ( robert carlyle ) get financial help from angela's mother , a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman

1," "" rebel without a cause "" is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to  
everyone feels that they are different in some way , that they don't belong in some places and "" rebel without a cause "" successfully shows on screen these universal emotions  
no matter what generation you belong to , these feelings are present

not only does "" rebel without a cause "" display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure

1,"only a year after the initial release of "" scream , "" the horror send-up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre , the inevitable sequel "" scream 2 "" has arrived in our theaters  
while the tongue-in-cheek , parodic element is still noticeable in this film , it's really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story  
the first film , while often violent and gruesome , was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant  
the premise of "" scream 2 "" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called "" stab , "" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in "" scream , "" is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening  
i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy  
its conclusion , in which a bleeding , wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it's a publicity stunt , is more surreal and disturbing than anything else  
the satire in "" scream 2 "" thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general  
although resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels ( and , interestingly enough , how they are usually inferior to their predecessors ) , the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well  
everything from "" friends "" and "" saved by the bell "" to "" showgirls "" and "" terminator 2 "" is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning , and there aren't any "" wes carpenter "" jokes this time "

the young , upwardly-mobile professional ( don't call them yuppies ! ) 
men and women of "" the last days of disco "" frequent a prestigious new york city nightclub pulsating to the bass-pounding rhythms of earth wind and fire , amy grant , and andrea true connection  
here they talk and talk and talk , intellectualizing about such things as dating , success , and being liked , accepted , and admired  
if talk is cheap , "" the last days of disco "" must surely have been an extremely inexpensive movie to shoot  
what makes the film so entertaining is that this preppie , harvard-educated jet set actually have something to say and say it with wit , perception , and style ( including , at one point , a riotously inventive deconstruction of "" the lady and the tramp "" )  
na ? ve alice ( chlo ? sevigny ) and sophisticated charlotte ( kate beckinsale ) are recent college graduates who work as assistant editors for a new york publishing house  
charlotte is confident and outspoken--perhaps a little too outspoken ; alice is shy and introverted , "" like a kindergarten teacher "

it is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals--it occupies the viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled  
while this film is not for the squeamish , there is no denying that seven demands attention , for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style and substance  
for starters , classifying seven as a "" thriller "" would not be an altogether complete classification of this film  
while i was genuinely thrilled throughout , i would rather call seven an "" intense drama , "" because that is what it delivers--meaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not readily let up  
part of director david finchers accomplishment is in style  
he seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as "" simple "" as a corpse  
and visually , fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in all-too-realistic and graphic terms ( courtesy of rob bottin's always-grisly special effects ) "
1,"the reunion film is not an original idea in any way , shape , or form  
it's been done throughout film history over and over again , and has become one of the many sub-genres , like the prep school sub-genre , the angst-filled teen sub-genre , and the slasher sub-genre  
what makes "" peter's friends "" so remarkable is not how it doesn't follow the rules of this sub-genre , but how it follows it so well , and creates characters that i wouldn't mind hanging with  
what are the rules of the reunion sub-genre ? 
well

1,"have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally , at any given moment , in life ? 
or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world , or outside of it ? 
these thought-provoking questions are the subject of "" final destination , "" which is the most riveting horror-drama since 1999's "" the sixth sense  "" 
stylishly filmed and tautly directed by "" x-files "" alum james wong , the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters ( in accurately written "" teen-speak , "" rather than overwrought , highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn't use ) , all the while developing into a darkly foreboding , severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less-successful , but still suspenseful epilogue  
at the start of the film , 17-year-old high school senior alex browning ( devon sawa ) is about to leave with his 40-student french class for a field trip to paris  
progressively getting a case of preflight jitters , he spots several mysterious "" coincidences , "" including the departure time being 9 : 25 , the same as his september 25 birthday , as well as hearing the john denver song "" rocky mountain high "" over the sound system in the airport bathroom  
 "" john denver died in a plane crash , "" alex grudgingly mutters to himself  
once seated , alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff , and after causing a ruckus onboard , he , as well as six other students and a teacher , are thrown off  
arguing in the airport lobby , alex's suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight , killing all 300+ passengers , including the rest of their classmates  
as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode , the fellow survivors , whom he has saved , treat him in varying manners  
carter ( kerr smith ) , the hotshot jock , holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate "
1,"you'd think it would be easy to spoof star trek , but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it  
that's a bit more difficult  
the farfetched sci-fi series is , after all , enormously popular , what with its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies  
if you're not nice to it , you lose  
galaxy quest is to star trek what mel brooks's spaceballs was to star wars , an affectionate , riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems mean-spirited or malintentioned  
 "" the show's been cancelled , but the journey is far from over  "" 
that is the current tagline of "" galaxy quest , "" a star trek - type show that's no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns  
it also lives on in conventions , gatherings of the show's obsessive fans who never fail to dress in "" galaxy quest "" costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble  
jason nesmith ( tim allen ) played "" commander peter quincy taggart "" on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do "
1,"in 1998 , director brett ratner and his stars , jackie chan and chris tucker , breathed new life into the buddy-action film genre with the cross-cultural "" rush hour "" - to the tune of about $250 million  
you don't mess with success , so the team is back again , and better , in "" rush hour 2  "" 
the combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non-stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in "" rush hour "" that played well to audiences around the world  
the formula worked so well , in fact , that the sequel was inevitable  
i'm never thrilled with the idea of a follow-up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations  
surprisingly , "" rush hour 2 "" wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it  
the script , by jeff nathanson ( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film ) , wastes no time getting to the point right from the start  
terrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong , killing two american translators , and chief inspector lee ( jackie chan ) is handed the job of solving the crime  
concurrently , his friend james carter ( chris tucker ) arrives on the island for some much needed r&r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights "
1," "" stuart little "" is one of the best family films to come out this year  
it's a cute , funny and very good-natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords  
though i read the book a long time ago and i really do not remember what it was about , i do know that this film does not disappoint  
finally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be , with a few surprising twists , some very funny moments , and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movie  
stuart little is a mouse  
he has finally gotten a new home after being put up for adoption , he now lives with the littles  
a nice little ( no pun intended ) family that lives in their apartment next to central park in new york city  
they have a little boy george ( played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki ) and now they have a new son  
at first stuart takes a while but he finally adjusts to being part of the family and even getting along with the pet cat "
1,"the first thing you notice about this movie is that it's cold  
placed in minnesota and north dakota during the winter , many of the scenes take place outside with long scenes of snow-covered ground against a background of white  
just what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night  
as with most coen brothers films , this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes , each of which works out in the oddest way possible  
a car salesman hires a couple of hoods to kidnap his wife so that he can collect the ransom from her father  
along the way everything that can possibly go wrong does  
in brief scenes of vicious violence , people get shot through the head , in the back , face , chest and various other areas of the anatomy  
there is also one of the most unpleasant body disposal scenes yet seen on the screen  
remarkably enough , most of the movie is played for laughs "
1,"three things i learned from "" being john malkovich "" : when getting on the elevator for your first day of work on the 7 1/2th floor of a building , always bring your crowbar ; don't stand in the way of your wife's actualization as a man ; and , whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being , wear old clothes , because , hey , it's muddy in there  
 "" being john malkovich "" is the most original film to come down the pike in a very long time  
wildly surrealistic , yet presented in a down-to-earth , funky style , this is the kind of movie that sticks in your head  
after savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline , you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it  
from the ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature of identity itself , there's a lot to think about here  
just don't forget to have fun  
clearly , all parties involved in the making of the film certainly did , starting with writer charles kaufman  
 "" i wrote 'being john malkovich' without an outline , "" he explains in the press notes , "" blindly , with no sense of direction or purpose  
it's important to me that i don't have a map before i start "
1,"albert brooks saves the day , just in the nick of time  
with a very poor summer for movies , brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up , and does so in a positive way  
while this may not be his finest work , "" the muse "" still shakes up some delightful humor  
in albert brook's latest comedy , he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter ( brooks ) who's losing his edge , as his business partners say  
in desperation , he goes to see his friend jack ( jeff bridges ) , who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past  
he asks jack for some help , and recieves word of a real life muse , that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career  
so brooks seeks the muse named sarah ( sharon stone ) , and is suckered into buying her expensive , food etc  as a sort of payment  
the real punch line however , doesn't come until the end "
1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction , the cinematic output from its creator , quentin tarantino , has been surprisingly low  
oh , he's been busy -- doing the talk show circuit , taking small roles in various films , overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn , making cameo appearances on television shows , providing a vignette for the ill-fated anthology four rooms -- everything , it seems , except direct another feature-length film  
it's been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr  tarantino's new feature film , jackie brown , one of the most anticipated films of the year , and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s  
things aren't going well for jackie brown ( pam grier )  
she's 44 years old , stuck at a dead-end job ( "" $16 , 000 a year , plus retirement benefits that aren't worth a damn "" ) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america -- and she's just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette ( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton ) and police officer mark dargus ( michael bowen ) smuggling $50 000 from mexico for gun-runner ordell robbie ( samuel l  jackson ) , who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) "

1,"almost a full decade before steven spielberg's saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both "" anti war "" and "" pro-soldier "" , john irvin's hamburger hill proved it could  
lost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stone's platoon , this excellent film was dismissed as "" too militaristic ""  
it's hard to understand exactly why---unless irvin , in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable ( and often naive ) reasons "" chose to show up "" for the vietnam debacle , ---has refused to present us with the stone killer , drug-stoked psycho and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what "" the polack , the hillbilly and the kid from brooklyn "" became to wwii movies  
hamburger hill , based on a true story , is not an easy film to watch  
there is a scene that will have graying anti-war activists squirming in their seats , or moved to genuine tears  
and the climactic final assault on the "" hill "" in question is visually confusing  
gristly realities are presented in brief flashes , as if the brain dared not acknowledged what it had encountered  
and in the mud and smoke officer and enlistee , veteran and "" newbie "" , black soldier and white , become almost indistinguishable from each other , as they do in the chaos of actual combat  
the acting throughout is solid with an absolutely stellar performance rendered by courtney b "
1,"expand the final fifteen minutes of home alone into a feature-length film and you've got baby's day out--an agreeably amusing children's comedy about a bumbling band of kid kidnappers who are unwittingly outwitted by an innocent infant  
the plot tracks a trio of crooks-posed-as-photographers ( mantegna , pantoliano , haley ) who steal nine-month-old bennington august cottwell iv , aka baby bink , from his old-money home  
but the plan goes awry when baby crawls out an open window and into the streets of downtown chicago ! 
following the path of his favorite story , called "" baby's day out , "" baby rides a bus and visits the zoo and winds up at a skyscraper construction site  
while baby stays unscathed , the crooks fare worse for the wear  
the stooges get hit by boards and dropped from roofs and , of course , suffer multiple crotch injuries

like he did in planes , trains , and automobiles , john hughes again demonstrates his mastery of the simple set-up and extended execution  
here , he's aided and abetted by a director , patrick read johnson , whose choreography could rival a coen brother

1,"your friends and neighbors is a rather bizarre film about 6 people , who hop in and out of bed with each other  
written and directed by neil labute , who's first film , "" in the company of men "" was simply marvelous , disappoints a bit here with this one  
the story involves two couples ( ben stiller & catherine keener and aaron eckhart & amy brenneman ) , an artist assistant ( nastassja kinski ) , and an egotistical women abuser ( jason patric )  
the character's names are not apparent and are not mentioned in the entire movie

1,"seen august 8 , 1998 at 6 p  m  at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam , ny ) , theater #6 , by myself for free using my sony/loews critic's pass  
[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] 
war is a topic that can't help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media  
movies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory  
it's easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other  
forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number  
 "" saving private ryan "" is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery  
it proves there's a huge difference between battling and killing "

eyes wide shot ( 1999 ) running time : 2 hours 39 minutes 2  35 : 1 theatrical aspect

bill hardford ) , nicole kidman ( alice hardford ) , sidney pollack , leelee sobieski , todd field ( nick nightingale ) directed , co-written , produced by : stanley kubrick inspired by : "" traumnovelle "" by : arthur schnitzer 
this is an interesting film  
i must first off state , that you musn't believe any of the rumors of the film  
cruise is not a cross dresser , kidman doesn't shoot heroin , and there's not any scene between the two that would suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist  
the look of the film is to suggest that it follows the translation of the inspired book from the film was written  
the translation , "" dream novel , "" makes you thing that the film should have been titled dream film "
1,"i had lost all faith in pg-13 movies that are intended for teenagers and adults  
the last dozen or so that i have seen have all felt incomplete , as if the most crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain a more lucrative rating  
however , after seeing the creative frequency last week and now the exciting u-571 , my bias is beginning to go away  
both films are as innocuous for younger viewers as they are intellectual for older viewers  
even better , i didn't think either one of these films would be any good from first instincts  
everyone loves surprises  
u-571 looked like another action film using an actual war as an excuse to shoot torpedoes and bullets  
this may be true , but the action is so extraordinary that it is clear director/co-writer jonathan mostow completed his ultimate goal ; to blow the audience's socks off  
set during the early stages of world war 2 when the united states struggled to break the codes of the technologically advanced german u-boats , u-571 follows a small crew of american men who swipe the typewriter necessary to solve the enigma from an enemy ship "

why would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn't count on it ? 
if this is your attitude , then i'll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh's hamlet is probably not for you , and you might as well stop reading right now  
if , however , you are a lover of the bard , or at the very least are open-minded about a challenging script , read on , for there is something rotten in the state of denmark  
namely , the king has died , and his widow the queen has wed the king's brother , claudius , but prince hamlet suspects foul play

1,"after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project , making the third installment in the godfather-trilogy  
this new film has been underrated for no reason  
it is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla's pervious films  
it is also more psychological , pessimistic and more tragic than the first two  
the only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some "" unfinished "" developments of some characters  
the film elegantly begins with nino rota's recognizable musical score , the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael's voice as he is writing a letter to his children : "" the only wealth in this world is children

1,"john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles  
so effortlessly that people tend to forget he's there , much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors ( anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor's face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors )  
example : the other day my mother asked me ( the expert , of course ) if there were any movies out worth seeing , never mind that our tastes couldn't be more divergent--- i'll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes , and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go ! 
was a lot of fun ( which it is ) , so i didn't see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation  
i muttered , with a little trepidation , that she might enjoy high fidelity  
she responded with her usual query , "" whose in that one ? "" 
this is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see  
if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light , a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing , and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people ( usually of the jewish faith ) fretting about in some upper east side palace  
anyway , when i answered "" john cusack "" , she replied with a rather stunned "" who ? "" , as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to  
now i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies , most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin , but i suppose it's understandable that she would not recognize the name , after all , for most , names are tougher than faces  
i showed her a picture of cusack's mug in the paper hoping for an "" oh - him , yes he's quite good "" instead i got a "" no - i don't know him "" "
1,"a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip-hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why today's youth seem attracted to black culture  
the review 
if black & white , the new film from writer/director james toback , is eventually remembered for only one thing , it will be the revelation that brooke shields , claudia schiffer , marla maples and mike tyson can act  
however , this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that  
black & white is a fascinating film ; it makes a statement about america's youth and hip-hop culture without getting heavy-handed overly serious  
featuring a cast of known commodities ( ben stiller , robert downey jr  ) and hot newcomers ( singers bijou phillips ) , toback's is a complex film worth seeing  
black & white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other , a la robert altman  
there is dean the basketball player ( allan houston ) who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear ( stiller ) in exchange for fifty grand a game  
this eventually spills over into the life of dean's long-time friend rich ( power ) , a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem "
1,"richard gere is not one of my favorite actors  
however , i like courtroom dramas , and this film looked good enough to take a chance on  
i wasn't disappointed  
it wasn't a great film , but it was interesting , and took several unexpected turns  
one thing : what's with the title ? 
not only is it extremely forgettable , it doesn't really have much to do with the film , as far as i could determine  
in the long run , it will probably hurt the film , as people won't be able to think of or remember it  
martin vail ( richard gere ) is a grandiose defense attorney

1,"virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre  
since 'dark city' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another

david cronenberg's existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone  
and when 'the thirteenth floor' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored  
i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again

as our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in  
well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released

1,"because the press screening of "" planet of the apes "" was one day past last issue's deadline , i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time , listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece  
the chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance , that the story was thin , that mark wahlberg's character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked  
to those people i would like to say ? what the hell did you expect ? 
this is a tim burton movie , boys and girls  
tim burton movies have great art direction and thin , clunky stories  
for the blissfully nasty , disjointed and underrated "" mars attacks ! "" 
 ( jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader and i were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie ) burton reportedly tossed vintage "" mars attacks ! "" 
trading cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face up  
burton's re-imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a planet where apes rule men looks great  
the apes , courtesy of make-up magician rick baker , are dazzling and ape city is a wonder to behold  
like astronaut leo davidson ( wahlberg ) , the film hits the ground running , whisking viewers through a head-spinning series of solid one-liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later  
as for wahlberg , consider what burton does with his character "
1,"the bond series is an island in the film world ; where else would we look forward to cliches , and all of the other things that occur in most of these films ? 
where else would pure escapism , a vulnerable hero , the "" talking villains , "" blatant product placement , predictable action sequences , and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a significant change ? 
i don't understand it myself , but that's what the bond series is based on  
for ( i think ) 18 films , we've mostly got the same thing over and over again , with some variation ( and a bit of change , most notably in the two dalton films )

in all fairness , it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it  
as if reservoir dogs wasn't perfect , tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction , a fast-paced , hard talking , roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way  
every major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor  
to begin with , the two hit men : vincent vega ( john travolta ) and jules winnfield ( samuel l  jackson )  
these two characters work together perfectly , and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect  
travolta , in fact , is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role  
if these two characters were not enough , there's the struggling boxer butch coolidge ( bruce willis ) , the two small-time criminals pumpkin ( tim roth ) and honey bunny ( amanda plummer ) , the big man in charge marsellus wallace ( ving rhames ) and his attractive young wife mia ( uma thurman ) , and the "" problem solver "" himself , the wolf ( harvey keitel ) "

but why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story , wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting ? 
obviously , the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi  
everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail : individual threads in the fabric , individual strands of hair swaying , wrinkles and pimples on skin , incredible water effects  
overall , the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue ; and the times when they don't sync perfectly really stand out , since the animation is usually so dazzling  
but you won't spend much time dwelling on those gaffes -- as soon as you catch one , the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering , "" wow    "" 
like the series of games , final fantasy's plot and characters have little to do with its predecessors , outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind , hironobu sakaguchi "
1,"zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we don't understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film  
zero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he'd like to think so )  
however , he's a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are  
zero's accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a "" normal "" guy who does the business side of the job -- he's the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero's greatness as an investigator  
the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero's talents to soon-to-be client gregory stark ( ryan o'neal )  
it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about  
zero takes the case , and the plot thickens  
his path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens )  
despite her luminous and seemingly-harmless presence , she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark "
1,"recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantville-one from entertainment weekly , one from a newsgroup , and two from different online resources  
each review compared this film to the truman show  
why ? 
the only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television  
other than that , the two movies are completely different from each other  
reviewers seem to love to pick one movie ( i  e  
the truman show ) , obsess over it , and make it a guideline for other movies  
when pleasantville and edtv opened , all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman  
the same goes for the thin red line , as well "
1,"scarface , a remake of the 1932 film of the same name , is a very gripping and , as far as i know , a true-to-life story of how power and violence lead to corruption  
al pacino , as tony montana ( for whom the movie is named ) , also provides a brilliant performance as a cuban refugee who comes to america with less than nothing and becomes one of the most highly respected and feared drug lords in miami  
oliver stone also penned the screenplay in one of his earlier writing roles  
the film begins by disclosing the story of now fidel castro ordered thousands of cubans to set sail and head for the coasts of the united states  
many of these cubans had criminal records , such as tony montana , a cocky , fast-talking man who has the look of crime  
nearly right after his arrival in miami , tony is thrust into the gangster life when he participates in a cocaine buy that goes awry  
along with his friend and partner , manolo ( steven bauer ) , tony rises in the gangster ranks when he forms a friendship with frank lopez ( robert loggia ) , a high-roller in the organized crime field  
tony also begins to fall in love with elvira ( michelle pfeiffer ) , who at the time was frank's lover  
of course , sooner or later in this industry , betrayal and corruption amount into a force greater than anything else , and tony is one of the ones who fall victim to this force "
1,"did you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually from this planet ? 
or if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extra-terrestrial ? 
i used to think that about my 7th grade english teacher , ms  carey  
but after seeing this movie , they may have confirmed my suspicions  
as the story goes , at any time , there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth  
the men in black ( mib ) are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens , guardians of our beloved planet from nasty-tempered aliens , and secret service to the stars  
based in new york city ( where weird is the norm ) , the mib organization gives human form to our space-faring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed  
but to enforce the laws of earth , the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast  
they carry other-worldly technology to erase people's short-term memory when common folk see the mib in action  
and their best leads on cosmic things-gone-awry are the supermarket tabloids "
1,"carry on matron is the last great carry-on film in my opinion  
made in 1972 , it still features most of the regulars of this genre  
sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit , kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting , head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac , hattie jacques re-takes her role as matron , and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr  goode  
the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs , with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard  
this time , williams is after matron ( jacques ) when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr  goode  
the doctor ( hawtrey ) is sworn to secrecy : - "" i assure you , that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other ! "" 
bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself  
there are great cameos from joan sims , an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene , and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he's at work ( at the railway station ) "
1,"there is a striking scene early in "" city of angels , "" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise  
the camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black  
then the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up  
you see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch  
it is an important scene for several reasons  
first of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible  
the film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference  
there are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like "" angels in the outfield "" ( 1994 ) or "" michael "" ( 1996 )  
the angels here are stark and believable "
1,"losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing  
reacting to such a personal setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare  
while we all might feel the desire to blow someone's head off with a shotgun when they don't seem to grasp our point of view , actually threatening them with one is usually something we avoid  
this isn't the case with sam baily - john travolta's slightly askew average-joe persona in mad city  
 "" i don't think people listen to guys like me , "" sam laments during an exclusive interview from behind the walls of a museum  
just a few days ago , sam was a guard at this same museum , but when cutbacks led to the elimination of his security position , sam's apprehension resulted in a brash decision  
in an effort to get his ex-boss , museum director mrs  banks ( blythe danner ) , to "" just listen "" , he barges into the museum one day equipped with a fully loaded shotgun , taking the uncooperative banks and a group of school children hostage  
sam's overall concern is valid enough - if he loses his job , his paycheck , his benefits , etc "
1,"tbwp is probably the single most profitable film ever  
not surprising , considering its tiny us$100 , 000 budget , to date it has earned in excess of us$130 million  
that's a shocking 100 times profit ! 
rumours have it that a smart internet `marketing' ploy was so successful in gaining cult-like fanatics , by word of mouth coupled with strings of excellent reviews , the film just exploded in the box-office , raking in millions on its opening weekend  
shot in 16mm and video ( i suspect  ) , the film chronicles the forays of 3 students who go in search for the legendary blair witch  
audiences are put in the first-person perspective in the entire mis-adventure , often wobbly and blurry at times , it takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning  
this is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the 3 disappeared ; edited and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audiences  
tbwp is simply smart  
filmed to look as if it was really a stock-shoot by a bunch of students in search of the blair witch as a school project , one may suspect ( like yours truly ) that its simply a lazy but smart approach to film-making "
1,"as a devout atheist and an avowed believer in aliens , i have some idea of how ellie aroway ( jodie foster ) feels  
but because my reasons for not partaking in religion are different than hers , i can't say that i do exactly  
her reason is that she needs solid proof : there is no proof that god existed , so therefor she does not believe  
ellie also believes in aliens , and has spent most of her life trying to prove they exist  
how can she say she doesn't believe in god because of the lack of proof , and then say she believes in aliens , which are gereally less believed in than god without sounding like a hypocrite ? 
that's the catch-22  
when aliens from the star vega fax her some plans for a device to transport someone to them ( okay , well , they didn't really * fax * them    )

as each day passes , the crew members begin to discover things about the place and themselves which set other things in motion  
saying anything else about the plot would be a crime  
have fun    
critique : "" i feel like shooting myself in the head "" are the first words that came out of my mouth after seeing this movie , a good indication as to what kind of film to expect here  
this ain't your average "" happy go lucky "" kind of picture  
this is a deliberately slow-paced mystery-horror film drenched in atmosphere , with a very creepy insane asylum ( in which most of the film takes place ) , very few clues up-front and lots to talk about afterwards "
1,"maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it's not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month , because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker , broadcasted on abc on a monday night , starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth , respectively  
because it's not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why it's so great  
underneath the to-die-for cinematography , the brilliant acting , and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty , not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it , tell it in a certain original way  
it doesn't merely go from plot point to plot point  
it goes from character to character  
it obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all , and makes the story of a world-reknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters , both musicians , who have a totally unique relationship  
it's that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball , shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this , unlike "" patch adams , "" effortlessly emotional and real  
in short , this movie is just awesome  
it merely tells its story really well , and that's something that just has to be commended these days , when most stories are botched because they're not told by great storytellers "

who's on the up and up , who's the real bad guy and who's gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie  
critique : the funnest movie that i've seen so far this year ! 
it's got style , it's got tough guys talkin' shite and it's got plenty of bullets to go around  
a definite hunk-a-hunk-a burnin' adventure ! 
a guy's guy movie through and through , and one that'll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff  
it's not very original , it goes on for a little too long , but costner and russell make it happen , as two shite-kickin' elvis lovers , who don't stop till they , more or less , drop  
this movie's got some pretty intensive shoot-out scenes , one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i've ever witnessed , featuring several elvises with guns a blazin' and the king's music playing in the background , and a decent helping of double-crosses , sharp dialogue and funny moments  
in fact , even though the cast is filled with many name actors ( b-actors as they might be for the most part ) , most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim

the truman show is one of the most unique films i have ever seen , and it deserves a spot on the "" decade's best "" list  
there is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim , "" yes , that's what makes this film great  "" 
the blend of peter weir's masterful ( and in many ways brilliant ) direction , peter biziou's stunning photography and jim carrey's performance is what makes this film work so fantastically

1,"trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of the semi-dramatic the commitments and the nearly slapstick a fish called wanda , the full monty is one film which delivered the depth of the former and the humour magnitude of the latter  
the film opens with a narrated documentary reel showing the improving economic and living standards of sheffield in the 60's , then cut to the harsh reality of the present  
sheffield has become some sort of a semi-slum with the only visible increase in anything was the amount of layoffs from steel-factories ; a once flourishing industry  
gaz ( carlyle ) spends most of his time in the worker's club , a sort of place where jobless people sit around to wait for job offers  
he and his `plump' friend dave ( addy ) as well as their former foreman gerald ( wilkinson ) have been sitting around the club for months without any `call for duty'  
what seemingly was just a passing hard time for gaz suddenly transformed itself into desperation when he cannot afford the 700 pounds of child-support money to his ex-wife  
suddenly finding himself facing the possiblity of losing custody of his son , he goes on to concoct an enterprising wild-idea to get the money he desperately requires  
dave and gerald too have problems of their own  
on top of his lack of employment , dave is also faced with the paranoia of his wife leaving him because of his current financial state as well as his`plump' appearance while gerald have been cheating on his wife by not telling her of his layoff for as long as 6 months , leaving home for `work' when he was actually a long-standing member of the worker's club "
1,"there's a thin line between satire and controversy , and mike nichols ( the birdcage , wolf ) has directed a sharp and very honest look at a us presidential election  
based on the book written by "" anonymous "" ( actually former "" newsweek "" writer joe klein ) , john travolta plays governor jack stanton  
but he doesn't actually play stanton  
he plays bill clinton ; just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady and billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville ( although the credits will of course say otherwise )  
the film is taken from the perspective of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , a morally correct and somewhat hesitant new advisor to stanton  
he searches for justice and dignity in the ugliest possible situations , and whether it be keeping the history of his boss' pants under wraps or contemplating digging up dirt on another politician , he approaches his work with a keen desire to skillfully serve his country and his fellow workers  
richard jemmons ( billy bob thorton ) and daisy green ( maura tierney ) team up with henry as the would-be president's advisors , and hire lesbian veteran libby holden ( kathy bates ) as the campaign's eccentric "" tougher than dirt "" incriminator  
together they face all sorts of sexual allegations , the irritatingly discourteous media and other witty politicians in the election race

1,"when casting the key part of the voice of moses , most people's first candidate would probably not be the controversial actor val kilmer ( the saint and the island of dr  
moreau ) , but he was dreamworks's choice in their first traditionally animated movie , the prince of egypt  
the selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one , but the biggest risk dreamworks took wasn't in the casting department  
the radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic , a la cecil b  demille , to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones  
in the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make a film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children  
animated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies , now that is something fresh  
let me admit up-front that i was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off  
dreamworks's antz seemed to be a movie not quite appropriate for any age group "

it certianly isn't for every taste , and it's sheer torture to sit through if you're in a restless mood

this was my second favorite movie of 1998 , and would have been a shoo-in for first in almost any other year  
perhaps the big turn-off for many was this film's unconventionality  
i'd be hard-pressed to compare it to any other film that i've seen - it is very , very artsy , incredibly slow - and amazingly , it works beautifully  
on my second viewing , i realized that the film follows the three act structure ( i didn't think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it )  
the first act serves to set up the characters - sort of  
it exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness , and perhaps even feelings of boredom "
1,"to me , nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film  
despite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed , the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence  
ever since the big success of the action-thriller `face/off' in 1997 , the hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr  cage  
the perpetually awful assassination thriller `snake eyes' was one of 1998's worst films  
`8mm' was a disappointing lost cause  
but who better than scorsese to match cage's wit and intensity , which he does in miraculous fashion with `bringing out the dead'  
cage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce , a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from day-to-day

but it's worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of working-class characters don't make for a guarantee of 'authenticity' , let alone a good film

1,"is it just me , or have disney films gradually lost their appeal ? 
i was almost stunned by the quality of "" who framed roger rabbit ? "" , a fun , unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together  
 "" the little mermaid "" harkened back to , and perhaps surpassed , the classic disney animations from the first half of the century  
however , the endless stream of "" the little mermaid "" wanna-be's is getting to me  
you know the spiel : a lame plot recycled from some well-known story , colorful , almost psychedelic animation , the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson , the comedic sidekick/sidekicks , the seemingly unattainable love interest , a few catchy songs , a few in-jokes for adults , and the occasional out of place warner-brothers-coyote-fall-off-the-cliff type joke  
it's a formula , and like any formula , it gets tiresome  
that's why i'm delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli , a japanese cartoon studio  
from what i've seen of their movies ( "" kiki's delivery service "" and the already english-dubbed and american- distributed "" my neighbor totoro "" ) , foreign audiences are in for a treat

in order to make the film a success , all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars , have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits

essentially , it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking  
it's overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy , not to mention very manipulative  
but oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is  
but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does , because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming , sleepless in seattle  
it couldn't have been the directing , because both films were helmed by the same woman  
i haven't quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you've got mail , but then again , is that really important ? 
if you like something so much , why even question it ? 
again , the storyline is as cliched as they come "
1,"getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity  
the film was directed by randal kleiser , who brought us such bubble-gum classics as grease and the blue lagoon  
but thanks to kleiser's surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script , getting it right is a pleasantly quiet , moving , and memorable film--one geared strictly toward a sophisticated , adult audience  
getting it right stars jesse birdsall ( emily lloyd's boyfriend in wish you were here ) as gavin , a painfully shy 31-year-old hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and who--gasp--is still a virgin  
gavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon , but expose him to a single 30-year-old beauty and he's a mess  
much to gavin's surprise , the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan ( lynn redgrave ) , a rich , married , and lonely 45-year-old  
getting it right is the simple story of gavin's awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right ; that is , to find the right woman to fulfill his life  
getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to in-depth character development  
gavin's self-conscious voice-over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche "
1,"when i saw the trailer for "" the sixth sense , "" i didn't expect much from it  
my snap judgment was that it was a watered-down version of "" the shining "" or possibly a late-entry in the glut of angel-related movies/tv shows of a couple years ago  
but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot  
it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year  
bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe  
at the beginning of the movie , he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work , but he is soon confronted by vincent , a patient malcolm failed years earlier ( donnie wahlberg-former new kid-in an impressive cameo )  
a year passes , and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed  
cole sear ( haley joel osment ) is a withdrawn kid who is called "" freak "" by the other boys in the neighborhood  
weird things seem to happen around cole-his mother ( olivia williams ) leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasn't moved-and cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldn't-for example , that there was once a gallows in his school "

1,"it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters  
his new film , the thin red line , is a strange , beautiful , enigmatic mess of a movie  
the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast  
it is filled with above-the-title stars  
the cast , for the most part , gives great performances  
john travolta , whose role is nothing more than a cameo , seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve  
george clooney , whose role became a cameo in editing , gives a strange performance  
one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character's narration  
the rest of the cast , especially nick nolte and elias koteas , are unambiguously fantastic "
1,"in chocolat , a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures , patterns , and lines , hoping she'll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they'll most enjoy  
some scoff the idea , but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next , revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before  
this can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no depth or true worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat's true colors begin to shine through  
making a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom's chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of the best films of the year  
what gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom's 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what's on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences  
the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness  
chocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion  
the bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non-religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens  
many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne's opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon-like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business "
1,"the postman delivers but not first class 
the postman a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman 
[warning : my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons : post-apocalypse stories , hope in a desperate situation , grassroots uprisings and kevin costner  
even worse , i thought that "" waterworld "" was watchable  
read the following with those particular grains of salt  ] 
it's the year 2013 and things have fallen apart  
due to a world war in the late nineties , the resulting three-year winter and a devastating plague , life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms  
although this is the future , it looks like a western  
as the film opens , kevin costner ( his character's name is never revealed ) is wandering the utah wastelands with only his mule bill for company  
giving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food and lodging , costner is an outsider in a land of outsiders  
running into even worse luck , he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem ( will patton ) "
1,"kadosh means sacred in hebrew  
amos gitai's fictional work , after spending most of his career doing documentaries , is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage , even though the marriage is a loving one  
the marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli's modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic's intolerable one , as both groups are vying for control of the secular government  
gitai ( devarim/yom yom ) is a labor party leftist , who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government , it would sound the death knell of israel  
the emphasis of the film is on how the ultra-orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god's law from only the male's view  
that if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are  
the story takes place in jerusalem's jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel  
this is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief  
it is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go "
1,"after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again  
there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice  
 "" you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , "" he says , "" then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , 'see you soon  ' "" 
of course , it's meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety  
you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience  
experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts  
trust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point  
juzo itami's tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan  
a stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) "
1,"i'm an avid fan of the "" alien "" saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it )  
of course , that doesn't mean that i'm gonna be giving this a four-star review or something , because "" alien : resurrection , "" the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were  
however , it's a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series  
in short , i had a good time  
 "" alien : resurrection "" leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre's answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one  
of course , the last one wasn't very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn't financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! )  
so back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that's a bad thing , but it's becoming a cliche )  
so she's cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called "" the auriga "" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr  wren , played by j "
1,"my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance ( or a movie that we've all seen a million times ) , two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins  
this is exactly what happened in this movie , but fortunately , they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way  
the movie starts with a quick ( and i do mean quick ) glance of two presidents russell kramer ( jack lemmon ) and matt douglas ( james garner )  
william haney ( dan aykroyd ) and ted matthews ( john heard ) are the new president and vice president  
there is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago

1,"not since 1996's shine , which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott , has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world-class musicians  
in fact , if one were to watch these films together , it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills  
yet hilary and jackie , the sophomore effort from director anand tucker , has something more to say -- it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale  
emily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale , playing the sisters du pr ?  
both musicians from childhood , hilary ( griffiths ) is renowned flutist while jacqueline ( watson ) is easily as skilled on the cello  
the two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women , both together and seperate  
their careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one another's , and although their lives take very different paths -- hilary settles down to marriage and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour -- they are bound together by their deep family love  
the performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance  
they contrast each other wonderfully , and while watson's portrayal of jackie du pr ? is at times eccentric and perhaps unsympathetic , both characters are charged with emotion "

a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i'm watching a 40-year-old class clown

mrs

while it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs

1,"let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal  
so i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal

under no circumstances , should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix  
this theater , owned by the parent company of one of hollywood's biggest studios , hasn't even graduated into stereo sound yet  
the mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age  
in other words , the sound sucked  
as someone used to digital sound in a movie theater , bad sound doesn't do anything to add to a film  
i'm not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together "
1,"studio expectations must not have been high for "" great expectations "" -- the film's release date was pushed from late december to late january at what appeared to be the last minute , therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in 1999  
it's actually a smart move , because while this updated take on the charles dickens tale isn't quite oscar fodder , it * is * strong enough to be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six weeks of any given year  
 "" great expectations "" also demonstrates how to modernize a classic story right , especially after the excruciatingly wretched excesses of baz luhrmann's "" william shakespeare's romeo + juliet  "" 
 "" great expectations "" opens somewhere in 1970s florida ( the original story is set in 19th-century england ) , as eight-year-old finn ( jeremy james kissner ) meets a trio of people who will have a profound effect on his life in the future  
there's icy , 11-year-old estella ( raquel beaudene ) , a pseudo-playmate of finn's ; ms  dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , estella's auntie who's quite off-kilter over a past romance that never took off ; and a mysterious prisoner ( robert de niro ) whom finn saves the life of  
finn , who lives with his sister's affable boyfriend ( lone star's chris cooper ) , fancies himself an aspiring artist , and proves his prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of estella using only ms  dinsmoor's lipstick , eyebrow pencil and the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion  
flash forward into the '90s ( after a brief stop in the '80s ) , and finn ( now played by ethan hawke ) , despondent over a strange hot-and-cold relationship with the elusive estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , receives quite a bit of money from an unknown benefactor ; it's enough cash to send him to new york to focus on a career in art "

1,"the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made  
i know that is very sweeping statement , so i'll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of "" science fiction , "" stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot  
2001 : a space odyssey is probably a better film , but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science  
most all other films we normally classify as science fiction , or sf , are really just fantasy , action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting  
the andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a high-tech ( for 1970 ) van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town

since i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film , there is no way to know how accurate the film is , but i suspect that much of it only came from whale's inner fantasies and hallucinations  
whale , who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures , decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him  
as the film tells it , during the end of his life , whale , at his large home in l  a  , became infatuated with the tall , handsome , and much younger man , clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) , who was working as the gardener at his home  
james whale , we learn quickly was , what many people refer to him as in the film , "" a dirty old man  "" 
in one of the opening scenes , a young film enthusiast visits whale's home to interview him and whale agrees , on one condition : for every question he answers , the young man must take off an article of clothing

1,"i'm not quite sure how best to go about writing this review  
i must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson's political satire "" wag the dog , "" but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it  
quite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn't do that  
they also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn't quite do that either  
a few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick's "" dr  
strangelove "" in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn't do that  
that said , "" wag the dog "" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them  
the story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office  
the accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn't particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president's campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood "

i'm twenty-two , but have been accused of looking sixteen  
yet as the film began , any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five close-knit , yet troubled sisters  
director pat o'connor ( inventing the abbots , circle of friends ) weaves a quiet yet affecting tale of loss , need , and the bonds between five sisters  
the family is ruled by kate ( meryl streep ) , an unconsciously strict schoolteacher , who is completely conscious of the deterioration of her family  
there is very little background given to the viewer , as we are thrust into a tense but loving home  
squabbles take place one after the other , caused by years and years of history  
perhaps one of the best things about this film , is its naturalness  
no situation is over-wrought , and characters react as real people do , to real problems "

gone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits  
in that sequence , we get a rockin' little tune from moby , along with some simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects

fucking good question , that  
it may not be an honour that instills the filmmakers with pride , but as far as i can tell oliver stone's script contains the said expletitive more times than any other film in cinema history  
yet it would be a shame if bad language is all de palma's scarface is remembered for , because this is a damn fine gangstar flick  
the overall structure is similar to howard hawks' 1932 original , but this time the scene has switched to miami , florida and our anti-hero's chosen vice is cocaine traffiking

the way the realm of genetics is heading , it may only take a couple decades until the future "" gattaca "" presents becomes true  
contrary to the misleading trailers , "" gattaca "" is not a sci-fi thriller , in the way that there's lots of murder , hitchcockian suspense , and chase scenes

now alien 3 is out  
and it is it's own film in the same right that alien and aliens were  
unlike aliens , alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens

with its examination of death , isolation , character restoration , and recovery from loss , suzanne myers' new independent film echoes the polish director's internationally-acclaimed 1993 release

1,"there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor's effort  
often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile  
when one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders  
but sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with "" the hurricane  "" 
this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin "" hurricane "" carter would normally be called "" norman jewison's 'the hurricane , ' "" as per the tradition of referring to a film "" belonging "" to a director  
but though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of "" the hurricane , "" because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington

the strength of this film is it's gritty realism  
the main characters are all human with individual flaws , no stereo-type hollywood heroes

jeesh ! 
out of all of these moves , however , the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation , "" 10 things i hate about you , "" is this past january's mediocre , ho-hum "" she's all that  "" 
although similar in plotting ( ok , darn near identical ) , "" 10 things i hate about you , "" a modern-day version of shakespeare's "" the taming of the shrew "" ( "" she's all that "" got its inspiration from "" pygmalion "" ) , is an infinitely superior film in every department , from the smart direction by first-time feature director gil junger to the charming and well-written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast , who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since 1985's "" the breakfast club  ""

though it doesn't present a snuff film ( a movie which documents a person's murder for real , usually during or after some form of sexual act ) as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as , say , natural born killers , 8 mm stays in your head long after you see it

russell frankiln ( jackson ) visits aquatica ( a sea-bound research center ) , where a research is being conducted on the extraction of a hormone substance found uniquely within the shark brain that can cure and reverse the effects of alzheimer's disease  
the substance is small in quantity and because of this , lead researcher dr  susan macalaester genetically alters the shark dna and grows them twice the size with brains as big as humans , naturally producing more of the much treasured hormones  
as sure as the sun sets in the west , a shark breaks lose and wreaks havoc within the facility during a hormone extraction procedure  
with the flexibility offered by cgi , the sharks get more full-length screen time as their predecessors did in those remote-controlled rubber suit days "
1,"whenever studio executives try to combine the successful formula of two blockbuster films , the end result is always a mess of a script , acting , directing , and generally a waste of time for any audience with an average iq above 40  
the latest movie morass from hollywood , the crew , appeared equally destined to fail , a strange combination of grumpy old men and goodfellas tossed together with the likes of richard dreyfuss and burt reynolds helming the ship  
the scary thing is that it's actually entertaining and a breath of fresh air in this otherwise stale month  
the crew works for several reasons  
the clever script is reminiscent of an old billy wilder movie , following four "" past their prime "" wiseguys from jersey who now live in the raj mahal apartment house in miami beach  
the wiseguys find themselves being evicted from their "" golden paradise "" by greedy landlords bent on raising rents for new beach bunnies and boys looking for beachfront property  
the four mobsters , bobby bartellemeo ( richard dreyfuss ) , joey "" bats "" pistella ( burt reynolds ) , mike "" the brick "" donatelli ( dan hedaya ) , and tony "" mouth "" donato ( seymour cassel ) decide to hatch a scheme to plant there a dead body heisted from the morgue in order to drive out the new tenants and keep their home  
this "" simple plan "" suddenly goes screwy , of course , and the boys become involved with a stripper named ferris ( jennifer tilly ) who wants her stepmother killed , a paranoid latin drug lord who's convinced a mysterious rival is out to get him , and a rat with its tail on fire  
the crew works as a strong comedic vehicle driven by a great ensemble cast of talented character actors and subtle leading men "

1,"there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie  
action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences , while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full-circle  
for fans of both genres , however , realism is key  
action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic , and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie's end  
on this advice , director john frankenheimer ( the island of dr  
moreau ) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller , ronin  
the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing , considering the fare that's fallen into the same category over the last few years

1,"renown surrealist director , the 77-year-old frenchman alain resnais ( hiroshima , mon amour/last year at marienbad/m ? lo ) , has created a lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter and his pennies from heaven ( 1978 tv serial , 1981 movie ) and the singing detective ( 1986 )  
the film follows potter's gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip-synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts  
he also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct , such as "" the umbrellas of cherbourg "" and "" the young girls of rochefort  "" 
the tale has resnais's unique touches as a director to go along with his homage  
it is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person , and that there is a song in everyone's heart for every occasion  
what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters , the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience ( the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers ) , and the farce seems more banal than daring  
yet it is not without its striking moments and charms , such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs  
also , the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story , while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else , which has always been embellished in movie lore , comes through with flying colors  
it also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there "

1,"titantic , writer and director james cameron's much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ? 
as a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful  
if you've already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again  
the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world's most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers  
in either case , it is filmmaking at its best  
when we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long  
he said no but that the time would go by so fast she'd never notice the length

1,"mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence  ) 
with three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest "" hot properties "" in action adventure stardom , and it's just about time  
for over twenty-five years , jackie's been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy  
 "" drunken master "" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to "" make it big "" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong  
i'm not entirely sure why , exactly  
in many ways , "" drunken master "" is similar to most of jackie's other early films , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii , "" master with cracked fingers "" , "" half a loaf of kung fu "" , "" spiritual kung fu "" , and others  
in fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories  
to be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste  
they're quite different from action movies as we know them in america "
1,"clint eastwood , in his ripe old age , is cashing one talent in for another  
midnight in the garden of good and evil is an eastwood-directed film clint isn't even in , and it's damn good  
adapted from a best-selling john berendt novel based on true events , this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah , where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head  
and that's just the mayor  
as director and producer , eastwood contributes a self- indulgent but very competent 150 minutes , neatly balancing drama , suspense and humor  
like all great movies , midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves , and not from some contrived , juvenile intrusion  
the acting , from big-time stars john cusack and kevin spacey , is as good as you'd expect , but it's the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm

1,"i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of "" good will hunting "" , based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film , in which the main character will hunting ( matt damon ) , an mit janitor in his early twenties , is discovered to be an einstein-level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight  
the only problem is that will is a tough street kid who's had his share of run-ins with the law , and before long he's being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight  
professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) , who had brought up the math problems in his lectures , tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police : will is to be released , provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions  
this sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff , but "" good will hunting "" rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama  
a conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will's therapist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) - lambeau wants to get will to use his brain , while sean wants him to listen to his heart , both of which he has been largely neglecting  
will finds that the former is much easier than the latter , so much so , in fact , that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau's attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle  
he also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar ( minnie driver ) , an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her  
what makes "" good will hunting "" work so well , aside from the strong performances ( especially from damon and williams ) , is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will's life  
the script's sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau , but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong "

in case of star wars , 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas , the consequences would be even more severe , because that film is very special for tens of millions , if not hundreds of millions of fans  
in any case , objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews , because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best , if not the best film of all times

in 1940 , walt disney released a filmed experiment  
fantasia was a blend of two art forms : classical music and animation  
while it was not immediately popular with the audiences of its day , it has since become recognized as something of a classic  
according to the program notes , it was mr  disney's intention to have fantasia be a continual work in progress  
sixty years later , thanks to the ongoing efforts of walt's nephew , a new fantasia is being released  
it was not only worth the waiting , it is evidence to just how far animation has come during the past half-decade  
with seven new sequences and one old favorite , fantasia 2000 exhibits an imagination and respect for its art form that is absent from most other feature films  
like the original , fantasia 2000 will more than likely bore the very young , although there is more narrative appeal in this newer version and the segments appear to be substantially shorter , perhaps a nod to the shorter attention span of the studio's primary audience "

1,"susan granger's review of "" bread and tulips "" ( first look pictures ) 
in this delightfully frothy italian romantic comedy , after accidentally being left behind by a tour bus while on a family vacation with her cranky husband and two cynical teenagers , rosalba ( licia maglietta ) , an unhappy housewife from pescara , finds herself - and love - in venice  
for the first time in years , rosalba's on her own when she's abandoned at a highway rest area  
although her philandering husband ( antonio catania ) , a plumbing-supply dealer , orders her to stay there until she's picked up , she impulsively accepts a ride to venice , a bohemian paradise which she's never visited  
rosalba finds refuge and romance with fernando ( bruno ganz ) , a gruff icelandic waiter who offers her a spare room in his modest apartment and prepares breakfast for her each morning  
to support herself , she gets a job working with a florist ( antonio catania )  
film-maker silvio soldini gently explores the blossoming of this bored , middle-aged , middle-class woman with warmth and affection , savoring special moments such as when rosalba starts playing the accordion again and abandons her maroon stretch pants , silver jacket and orange sneakers for a simple , new red-and-white dress with platform-soled espadrilles  
the superb actors slip into their roles seamlessly , particularly luminous licia maglietta and low-key bruno ganz , along with marina massironi as her nosy massage-therapist neighbor and giuseppe massironi as the inept plumber-turned-private eye who's sent to retrieve her on orders from her frantic husband - who's discovered that his mistress has no interest in doing his laundry or cleaning the house

1,"when people are talking about good old times , they actually want to make some bad times look better  
nice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s

for people who actually had to live in that period , it was the gloomy decade , marked by lost ideals of 1968 , rampant inflation and unemployment , international terrorism , fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for  
feelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era

1,"no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan's harrowing , humorous , horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe's novel about young lad francie brady's ( eamonn owens ) descent into madness in 1960s ireland  
on one hand , it was difficult for me to become invested in francie's story because he is such an unsavory character , unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs  nugent ( fiona shaw )  
on another hand , i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie's darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick , needy child , having been raised by a drunken father ( stephen rea ) and a suicidal mother ( aisling o'sullivan )  
on yet another hand , i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his , for lack of a better word , "" bad "" deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them  
however , the butcher boy's power is undeniable , and the film as a whole is unforgettable--perhaps because it is so disturbing  
what makes it so unsettling is the francie's overall wink-wink yet matter-of-fact attitude about everything , expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie ( rea again )  
think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs , and you'll sort of understand

throughout , packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse , a tribe of `ute' indians that doesn't seem quite on the mark , and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism

the aforementioned `ute' indian tribe that packer's group encounters is a definite highlight , as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen ( one of which ends on a comedically deadly note )  
stone's humphrey character steals the show , especially when complaining about the prospect of having to `eat butt' or revealing what's underneath his muff cap

and , same as in the case of dances with wolves , he was awarded for his effort with "" oscars ""  
the name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson  
the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 )  
in his time , english king edward i "" longshanks "" ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by "" ius primae noctis "" and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights  
although english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn't care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack )  
murron's death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country "
1,"it's terribly unfortunate that "" stir of echoes , "" tautly written and directed by david koepp ( who made one of 1996's unsung treasures , "" the trigger effect "" ) , should be released little more than a month after "" the sixth sense , "" which is still going strong at the box office  
these two films are undoubtedly going to be compared ( judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night ) , and although they have eerily similar storylines , "" stir of echoes "" is more of a straightforward psychological horror film , while "" the sixth sense "" is closer to a psychological drama  
additionally , while "" the sixth sense "" had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business , "" stir of echoes "" is more conventional and predictable in its final twist  
and where "" the sixth sense "" was disturbing , "" stir of echoes "" is just plain scary  
i have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities , and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits  
adapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago , "" stir of echoes "" opens with a cute six-year-old boy named jake ( zachary david cope ) who is taking a bath  
he is speaking directly at the screen , but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there  
finally , he asks , "" does it hurt to be dead ? ""

28 men set sail on the brigantine endurance and they would not be heard from again for nearly two years  
director george butler , using film footage and photographs from the historic journey , tells their remarkable story in "" the endurance : shackleton's legendary antarctic expedition  "" 
the expedition started out as a merely incredibly difficult quest to traverse , on foot , the vast wasteland of antarctica  
as the intrepid ship and crew entered the weddell sea , the entry to the cold , cruel continent , they did not plan on the dense pack ice bringing the voyage to an abrupt halt as the endurance became trapped within sight of land  
for months the ice thickened and compressed until the ship was crushed , stranding the men on the flow , propelling them away from their goal and , eventually , into their lifeboats for safety

east meets west in mulan , the latest installment in disney's parade of annual animated feature films  
an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass-market commercial sensibilities , this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years , but falls short of actualizing its potential  
though not for lack of trying  
in many respects , mulan is among disney's most mature efforts , skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat  
the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the imagery of a pillaged village , neatly encapsulated in the form of a child's discarded doll , is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars , and mulan's later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy , bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a hollywood animated film , long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent , dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner ? 
in an instant , idealistic mulan's innocence is lost , and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending  
the film , based upon an ancient chinese fable , centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family's obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns ( cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones , replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger-edged teeth , although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace )  
dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western / european fables and literature for decades , disney's new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere , story intact , to some neutral territory , and revels in its east asian roots ; aside from a predominantly asian-american cast providing the film's vocal work , there's liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout , and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence "

1,"1992's alien3 marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself--box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979's alien and 1986's aliens , savaged david fincher's slog of a sendoff ( myself included )  
hence , weaver , director jean-pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two-fold challenge--not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once-profitable series from the scrap heap  
despite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two  
writer joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem--clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film  
that done , the _real_ challenge presents itself--what do with her  
alien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death  
what could be next ? 
whedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also "" infected "" with alien dna  
so the new ripley is , indeed , new--a human/alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude

 "" fun "" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective

1,"after being hypnotized , a man believes there is a ghost in his house  
the review 
two low-key summer horror films have become surprise financial successes this year : the blair witch project and the sixth sense  
each has made well over $100 million in north america , based on a combination of strong word of mouth and clever advertising  
if a film's box office take were based primarily on its quality , stir of echoes would join blair and sense in grossing far more money than expected , for it is as scary , if not scarier than the other two  
writer/director david koepp has given artisan entertainment , the folks who distributed blair witch a second creepy hit  
the story gets going after tom witzky ( bacon ) , an average blue-collar dad , gets hypnotized by his wife maggie's ( erbe ) sister lisa ( douglas ) at a party  
while the hypnosis goes as expected to the party-goers , it triggers something in tom's head  
things begin to change around him ( blinking red lights let off a strange hum , for example ) , and he fights to stay in control of his own senses  
where these experiences take tom , maggie and their son jake ( cope ) , who tom thinks might have some answers , is down a dark path that will scare and disturb you "
1,"for those of us who weren't yet born when the 1960's rock 'n' rolled around , monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies  
from otis redding to jimi hendrix , janis joplin to the mamas and the papas , and jefferson airplane to the who , this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy  
but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending , which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves  
shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock , the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time  
sure , some have painted their faces and smoke joints , but d  a

1,"bob the happy bastard's quickie review : 
the matrix 
what's worse than y2k ? 
how about a fully digital future where nothing is real ? 
that's what computer programmer neo ( keanu reeves ) slowly learns as he enters the dangerous world that is the matrix , a movie directed by the wachowski brothers ( the guys behind the hip thriller bound )  
before you groan at the presence of reeves in the lead role , hold on  
there's actually a story with depth here  
it seems that a group of hackers is out to stop the system that is the matrix , led by the bald but brilliant laurence fishburne and assisted by carrie ann moss , who looks quite cool in leather , i must say  
neo ( reeves ) is pretty much a key player in this fight , although he really doesn't look it at first  
could this amateur be "" the one "" as fisburne thinks he is ? 
credit the wachowskis for putting together a great story that allows suspense to build , something that few special effects-laden films seem to do these days  
there's plenty of effects to go around , of course , but at least there's a backbone to build them on as well  
reeves is surprisingly good in his role as neo , particularly in a fight scene with fishburne that comes across as goofy , yet great  
i wish the villains weren't quite so "" generic "" ( leftover g-men from looking for a sweet sci-fi actioner with plenty of stop-motion swooping camera angles and , of course , a motherlode of a helicopter explosion "

some time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel  
the novel was a summer smash , topping best-seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads  
the only problem : the novel wasn't very good  
it was far more pulp than pulitzer  
but the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller

1," "" sometimes the 'green mile' seems sooooo long  "" 
indeed  
and any filmmaker with a three hour movie who ends it with that gem of dialogue should expect to see it quoted in a review  
on a more positive note , let me add that sometimes the green mile is almost good enough to make us forget its length  
the mile in question ( green due to its faded lime-colored linoleum ) leads from the prison cell to "" old sparky , "" the electric chair where executions were carried out at louisiana's cold mountain penitentiary in 1935  
paul edgecomb ( tom hanks , you've got mail ) is the head guard of e-block , otherwise known as death row  
keeping his prisoners calm as they await the carrying out of their sentence is his primary responsibility  
it is a responsibility which he capably delegates to the other guards on his watch by insisting they "" talk to "" the convicts instead of yelling at them  
this practice leads to an unusual camaraderie between the guards and the men behind their bars "

while fincher's films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples ) , fight club marks the distillation of his pitch-black comedic sensibility ( see 1997's the game ) into something like a definitive statement  
jack ( norton , acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone , whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia  
on the offhand advice of a doctor , he sits in on group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer  
here he meets bob ( marvin lee aday , aka meat loaf ) , a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia  
strangely , the release he finds while sobbing on bob's breasts allows him to sleep at night , at least until a fellow group-therapy "" tourist "" named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him , forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity  
later , he meets tyler durden ( pitt ) , a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life  
one night , after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( don't ask-- you'll just have to see the movie , awright ? ) , he is goaded by tyler into a fight , and damned if it doesn't feel good  
it is pure , raw existence , a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison "

as the flap falls , the battle begins  
they are trapped like rats in a cage and proceed to be blown to pieces in the wake of enemy gunfire  
amid the chaos of this massacre , stands a shot that , at least for me , hangs in the air like the girl in the little red coat in schindler's list

1,"[note : after claiming otherwise , my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branagh's hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap  
as it happens , it didn't take long  ] 
is there a more romantic director than franco zeffirelli ? 
known mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968's romeo and juliet ( required viewing for many high schoolers , and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare ) , he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera , where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a puccini aria  
last year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre , one of the twin peaks ( with wuthering heights ) of romantic literature  
it might seem peculiar , then , that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen  
at first blush , hamlet is far removed from romance  
the hero , though a prince , is depressed , conflicted and confused  
the ostensible love interest gets little screen time , and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery  
the plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus "
1,"it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child ? whether that may be in life or in death  
after having said that , i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well

there is no ocean , no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yet another ? ordinary people'  
in fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing ( not that this literally happened in the movie )

1,"films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before  
for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen  
to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd  
the book ( or "" graphic novel , "" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes  
in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source  
if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes  
getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? 
the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end  
it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called "" unfortunates "" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision

in the exotic morocco of 1972 , a 25-year-old english hippie mother , julia ( winslet ) , of two sweet young girls , the 6-year-old lucy ( carrie ) and the 8-year-old bea ( bella ) , has arrived for a year's stay , with the self-absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband ( she is not officially married to him ) and her cold one-room london flat , and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech  
at least she says she is , as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers  
she has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn't seem like it's much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in  
drugs , a world-wide youthful phenomena during this period , where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the 'good life' cheaply , and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities , even though drugs are illegal there  
but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here  
in this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken  
even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons , to follow the mystical sufis , seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from

>from time-to-time , everyone thinks about the roads not taken , and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different  
perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train , for example -- could have an equally profound , yet less obvious , impact  
maybe that's where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ? 
film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that's why there's no shortage of movies about this subject  
the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance  
these themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red  
however , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life  
in his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : "" [the idea is] rich and interesting ? that every day we're faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we're completely unaware "

all the sorrows , joys , longings , sufferings , and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and , as their bittersweet memories are given expression , one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future

this was the period when x-rated movies were real movies , shot on film , shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics  
this was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films , films that attempted to tell a real story

1,"playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task : they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare's works  
they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare : i mean , really , who doesn't think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate , introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter ? 
stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare , and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare  
and , despite the difficulty of their task , they have succeeded  
shakespeare in love is one of the smartest , funniest , most touching films of the year  
it's so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors , but here we have a movie that defines success : it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written  
it could have been a smug , self-important movie that panders to die-hard shakespeare fans , but the appeal of this film is almost universal : if you've ever read a play by shakespeare , or know anything about his life , it's likely that you'll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love

beloved by kids and their parents , respected equally by mainstream america and geekish movie buffs , that first movie remains a landmark of recent history , the one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzle-dazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal songwriting  
if disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game ( toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions , and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply ) , it didn't show , and as distributor and part-owner of the property , at least it had a piece of the action  
toy story 2 was greenlighted as a direct-to-video project , disney's standard tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film  
as someone who doesn't believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing ( granted , they usually are a bad thing , but that's because they're made for the wrong reasons ) , i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking  
fortunately , disney claimed to have been so knocked-out by early animation tests that they let pixar go full-speed ahead with a theatrical sequel  
lucky thing , too -- like the first movie , this one is a joy to behold on the big screen , and technically , it improves on its predecessor on just about every level  
 ( from a business standpoint , the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar , while the previous film's elements are shared between pixar and disney , a sign of the production house's new cachet in hollywood  )

1,"call me crazy , but i don't see saving private ryan as the film of the summer  
a good movie , yes , with chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion to spare  
an utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielberg's best work , no  
personally , if i was spielberg , i wouldn't go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindler's list and the indiana jones movies  
i'm guessing steve has a thing for nazis ; i really wouldn't be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swastika-wearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie  
all lofty pretenses aside , saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of a 1980s slasher flick  
the difference is , it's easy during friday the 13th to laugh off a spear sticking out of kevin bacon's chest while blood spurts like crazy , but it's damn hard to sit and eat reese's pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield  
and believe me , there's plenty of it

 "" detective story "" features one of kirk douglas's finest performances  
he stars as a new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night

the film opens with the douglas character getting ready to go home to his wife , but through a series of events , he never quite makes it there

the story of us , a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family , is a well written , heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience , including myself , cry  
the story of us tells the story of ben ( bruce willis ) and katie ( michelle pfeiffer ) jordan , and asks the question , "" can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage ? "" 
the film is about two individuals who have come together , spent a good chunk of their lives together , and shows when our main characters are "" him "" and "" her "" ( during the bad times ) , and when they are "" us "" ( during the good times )  
the story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day

1,"the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and "" real "" movies  
consider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved -- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste  
top-flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety  
based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks , the movie represents a rethinking of the story's structure , not merely a literal adaptation of the novel  
told in linear form by four narrators in the book , egoyan's version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator  
the author is even on record as applauding egoyan's changes  
in the press notes the book's author describes the story as "" a parable of lost children  "" 
he says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children

1,"in 1994 , an insider's look at a scandal-ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination ( closely based on clinton's 1992 campaign ) was written anonymously ( former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship )  
now , the book , primary colors , has been made into a movie , directed by mike nichols , and , in light of recent presidential scandals , seems to be more relevant than ever  
but the film is more than a diatribe against , or a paean in praise of , the president  
it is a fascinating look at the political machinery , and the ethical quagmire , that surround modern politics  
jack stanton ( john travolta ) is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination  
he is charismatic , but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign , and strains his relationship with his wife , susan ( emma thompson )  
the film is told from the point of view of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , grandson of a civil rights leader , who is swept away by stanton's ideals and helps to organize the campaign  
he joins political strategist richard jemmons ( billy bob thornton , looking an awful lot like james carville ) , and campaign advisor daisy green ( maura tierney )  
governor stanton's past repeatedly pops up to haunt him , a fact that his chief rival , lawrence harris ( kevin cooney ) , consistently uses to his advantage "
1,"plot : a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon , to whom he's devoted a tribute band in which he sings , gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place  
critique : i'm a sucker for movies like this  
a young man with a humble background and lofty dreams , works hard , devotes the time , the energy and the patience , and ultimately hits it big-time  
in the case of this film , our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it ( yup , luck always finds its way into these types of equations , although generally tied very closely to hard work ) , they need a new singer  
his entry and adaptation to the whole "" rock 'n roll "" lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch  
although i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love ( or past love ) of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it  
metal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn't that prominent anymore , i still check out my motley crue , twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again  
that's not to say that you won't like this film if you don't like the music , but the music and live performances from the band , play a big part in the movie , and i for one , had a blast watching and listening to it all  
but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg "

death -- even gruesome , bloody death -- can be funny if handled the right way ( some will be offended by this statement , but you need look no further than pulp fiction for an example )  
and , while there's plenty of horror to go around in scream 2 , the latest '90s slasher flick incarnation , there are also a few laughs to be had  
scream 2 is a slice-and-dice movie for those who don't take their horror too seriously  
the success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise  
the unexpected blockbuster , whose gross soared over the $100 million mark during its six month release window , opened just about a year ago and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all time  
a sequel was inevitable ; fortunately , nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream 2 , including director wes craven , screenwriter kevin williamson , and actors neve campbell , courtney cox , david arquette , jamie kennedy , and liev schreiber  
as stipulated by one of the "" rules of sequels "" uttered by a movie- obsessed character in the film , the body count in scream 2 is higher than that in the original

the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done

in short , if you like really raunchy humor , you may find it , as i did , to be the funniest movie of the year  
 ( on the other hand , if you are one of those who walked out in disgust with smith's dogma , then jay and silent bob strike back is not the movie for you  ) 
in one of the fastest paced movies of the year , the story has jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith ) , a pair of card carrying drug dealers , traveling from their new jersey convenience store home to hollywood so that they can stop a movie

and i suppose that's exactly what verhoeven delivers , with sometimes hilarious results  
heinlein's basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become a source of amusement , while their strengths become the stuff of high-energy entertainment

de sade's craft and life are threatened when the emperor dispatches dr royer-collard ( michael caine ) to stop the marquis' work , permanently  
review : "" quills "" is an exploration of the marquis de sade : his madness , his cruelty and his perversion , his obsession with sex in any form , no matter how obscene

the movie takes place in a futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not sexual reproduction  
this allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color , intelligence and life span they'd like for their child , and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects

1,"originally launched in 1978 , this popular film was re-introduced in 1998 to a whole new generation of moviegoers  
based on the mighty successful musical from broadway , grease was followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2 ( 6  5/10 ) , 
starring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles  
plot : high-school musical set in the 1950's showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the t-birds ( travolta ) and the innocent and pure sandy olsen ( newton-john ) from australia  
the film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song , dance and humour  
critique : fun-loving , energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler  
this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950's , with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers  
admittedly , i am somewhat biased in this opinion , since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth ( grease was one of schmoe's first big-screen experiences , and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubble-gum card collection ) , and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time  
but apart from the nostalgic vibe , i was still extremely impressed by this film , as it continued to amuse me , despite my previous dozen or so viewings "
1,"it's been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller , where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters , but it's been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually * shock * cared for the characters , not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles , flaws , and strengths to emerge so radiantly  
i'd saw that it's been at least a couple decades , even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers , though i'm hardly comparing "" a simple plan "" to , say , "" rear window "" or "" strangers on a train  "" 
yet it's almost as good  
it's simple , yet strangely complex , and astonishingly rewarding , because instead of moving from plot point to plot point , and merely laying out they-might-be-caught overtones , it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to , all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral  
elegantly directed by sam raimi ( yes , the same ) , "" a simple plan "" concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright , moderately financially stable working man ( bill paxton ) , his dim-witted brother ( billy bob thornton ) , and his drinking buddy ( brent briscoe )  
without anyone around , and the possibility that no one would come looking for it , the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes , they will keep it , but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking , and so they generally don't flaunt anything they don't want to flaunt , they'll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton  
the possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners , who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves  
 "" a simple plan , "" though borrows a little from each of these  
a little tiff with the cops here , a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there ) , and a bit of inside feuding over here "
1,"it's an interesting premise  
our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real  
in truth , our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains  
what we see , what we do , everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence  
our bodies , severely atrophied , are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet  
the sci-fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along  
the matrix isn't it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network , a sham world , the ability to plug one's brain into a computer , has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator , dark city , and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation )  
what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking  
keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo , who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer-generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines "
1,"even if i did not know that director and co-writers james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the x-files , i would have inevitably made a connection  
the similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon- like plot , to the mysterious characters , to the overall dark , ominous settings  
it would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case , they witness stuff like this on a weekly basis ( in fact mulder and scully would have been a much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie )  
another more important similarity , is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time  
this is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie , especially when compared to some of the trash , of the same genre , released in the last couple of years ( urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch )  
what helps final destination is its unique premise  
unlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders , the villain presented is unusual , it's the grim reaper  
this being already has predestined when and how you will die  
according to the brief history lesson given in this film , everyone was meant to die at a certain time , some people at 100 , others at 17 , whatever death chooses "
1,"if you're the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland , you're going to love the hunt for red october  
you'll also love the film if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics , or if you're a sean connery or alec baldwin fan , or if you admired director john mctiernan's earlier films , die hard and predator  
in fact , the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are those who have read the book , since films almost never live up to the novels which inspired them  
the hunt for red october is an epic thriller , adapted from tom clancy's best selling novel  
set in an era before glasnost , the movie revolves around a top-secret soviet submarine , called the red october  
the nuclear sub has a revolutionary propulsion system , which makes the vessel silent and allows it to escape sonar detection  
the red october embarks on its maiden voyage under the command of captain marko ramius , played by sean connery  
ramius has strict orders just to test the submarine , but he has other ideas  
he takes the sub and its crew and disappears into the atlantic ocean "

1,"sick : the life and death of bob flanagan , supermasochist 
by fernando vallejo 
starring bob flanagan and sheree rose  
interviews by kathe burkhart , kirby dick and rita valencia  
produced and directed by kirby dick  
running time : 90 mins  
this film is not rated  
the central themes of "" sick : the life and death of bob flanagan , supermasochist "" are pain and love , and its subsequent effect on a person's life  
its protagonist , bob flanagan , who died at the age of 52 , suffered from cystic fibrosis , a mortal disease which debilitates the lungs by saturating them with thick coats of mucus , preventing him from normal breathing  
the movie is about much more than recouperating ( or attempting to ) from this disease  
an audacious , fabulously triumphant docudrama , "" sick "" chronicles the life of flanagan and his vicious , unthinkable acts of sadomasochism conducted with his mistress of 15 years , sheree rose , who amazingly provided much of the footage for the film "
1,"with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous "" ellen "" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines  
the birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy  
then along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released  
it's also noticeable that this "" alternative lifestyle "" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort  
while it's a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety  
but the way we're using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically  
while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy  
it doesn't poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it's comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been  
the idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids-afflicted gay man in philadelphia "
1,"the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king's work  
this slow-moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals , but suffers from a tepid conclusion , inconsistent direction , and may not have wide commercial appeal  
when the maid , dolores claiborne , is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer , it seems like an open-and-shut murder case  
upon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax , dolores' estranged and bitter daughter , esquire magazine writer selena st  george , returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home  
as the two clash horns , the story behind the mysterious death of dolores' abusive husband two decades ago , ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey , is revealed  
did dolores kill her husband ? 
and did she kill her employer ? 
dolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller  
consequently , it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood's finest character actors , such as bates , leigh and strathairn  
kathy bates plays the film's title character , and gives a sensational lead performance "

truman burbank ( jim carrey ) seems to have the perfect life  
he has a pretty , doting wife meryl ( laura linney ) , a comfortable insurance sales position , an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven , a reliable childhood buddy marlon ( noah emmerich ) -- except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia , this is paradise

1,"star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) 
review by matt pusateri 
few movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas' 1977 classic , star wars  
the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture  
arguably , more americans today can explain what "" the force "" or a "" jedi "" is than a budget deficit or a serb  
so 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? 
can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? 
against this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week  
and despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment  
while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking  
it is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films  
the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films  
as the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) "
1,"contact ( pg ) there's a moment late in robert zemeckis's contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place  
we see a scientist , dressed in a silvery space suit , walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact , spherical space pod , unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops  
anticipation , excitement , anxiety , fear--the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character , nervously , breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead  
it is this sense of discovery , the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration , that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical , captivating entertainment  
jodie foster stars as dr  ellie arroway , a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals  
and i mean life--after losing her entire family when she was young , the only thing occupying ellie's world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth  
after dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers , ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega , which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport  
from this synopsis , contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact , but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci-fi hook "
1,"the farrelly brothers' third film , after dumb and dumber ( 7  5/10 ) and kingpin ( 8/10 ) , brings together the real-life couple of cameron diaz and matt dillon , some nasty humour , a cute dog , and a mix of love , fate and romance  
plot : high-school nerd ted gets lucky when the cutest girl in his class asks him to the prom  
unfortunately for ted , he accidentally gets a part of his male anatomy ( ouch ! ) 
caught in his zipper , and misses the big night  
thirteen years later , ted still can't get mary out of his mind , and hires a private detective ( dillon ) to find her  
once found , it turns out that mary has more than one suitor , and that's when the real fun begins  
critique : likeable comedy with a few extremely funny scenes , some funny looking people , and a plot that won't ever put you to sleep  
having said that , i must admit that i did like the farrellys' two previous films more than this one , but that is saying a lot , since i really did love those earlier pics  
this one is also quite funny , but it didn't really blow me away like the others "
1,"the characters in "" palmetto "" collectively sweat enough to fill lake erie , and it's just the right way to capture the film's ripe atmosphere of sensuality , tension and even farce  
this humid florida-set thriller nurtures a modestly absurd edginess that often winks at itself , which is very much a good thing since the actors and director are in on the joke  
as far as set-up is concerned , the movie is nothing we haven't seen before , but be patient -- "" palmetto "" spins some pretty wicked story twists that we really don't see coming  
it's not a classic by any means , but it sure is quite an engaging surprise  
harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is fresh out of prison , where he's served a couple of years for a crime he didn't commit  
even though he harbors animosity towards the obtuse local officials , harry's first order of business is to return to his home town of palmetto to be with his sculptor girlfriend nina ( gina gershon )  
while searching for work , he catches the eye of rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue ) , the mysterious sexbomb wife of a palmetto millionaire

1,"synopsis : in this cultural exploration , a chinese american computer engineer named fang ( peter wang ) decides to take a month-long vacation to visit his sister mrs  chao ( shen guanglan ) , her husband mr  chao ( hy xiaoguang ) , and their teenage daughter lili ( li qinqin ) in beijing after 30 years of separation  
fang brings his asian american wife grace ( sharon iwai ) and his college-aged son paul ( kelvin han yee ) along , both of whom don't speak chinese  
the encounter between the two families allows the audience to compare the eastern and western cultures as well as the ambitions of individual characters  
opinion : sometimes a film is plot driven  
sometimes it's a character sketch  
a great wall ( 1986 ) can be called a culture sketch , as opposed to a character sketch because it gently compares a chinese american family to a beijing family  
fang's family is thoroughly americanized "
1,"true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head-on , which is probably why so few of them do it  
even the most religious directors - like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman - usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms  
so it's not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get "" the apostle "" onto the big-screen  
as a matter of fact , even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing , and he ended up paying for it with $5 million of his own money  
he also wrote the script , directed the film , and starred as the central character , a fiery texas preacher named euliss "" sonny "" dewey  
few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial , technical , and creative responsibility single-handedly , and it's testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall  
and , thankfully , every bit of that personal investment translates on-screen into power and honest emotion  
sonny is an energetic , pentecostal preacher who has been speaking ( actually shouting ) from behind the pulpit since he was twelve  
he spends much of his time traveling about the country , evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals "
1,"are we victims of fate in life or can we create our own destiny ? 
director/writer brad anderson seems to be saying yes to both questions in his witty film "" next stop wonderland ""  
the two main characters , alan and erin , spend the entire movie in each other's orbit , catching glimpses of one another , yet not quite connecting until the inevitable conclusion  
is it fate that keeps them near each other and ultimately puts them together ? 
does this predestination carry over to all aspects of life ? 
as the film starts , erin castleton ( hope davis ) , a melancholy 29- year old late shift nurse , is ending her live-in relationship with her boyfriend ( hoffman )  
rather , he is ending it with her  
arriving home from work , erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of their apartment , car packed with his belongings  
in a fumbling , amusing and self deluding ramble , he instructs erin to watch a videotape he's made detailing why their relationship is doomed to fail and why he's leaving  
it's obvious he lacks the courage to confront her directly as he rails on about accomplishing something with his life and taking a stand , all the while backpedaling his way out of their relationship  
he then flees the scene with the grace of an inept thief  
erin's mother ( holland taylor , in a surprisingly effective , small role ) , fearing that her daughter will be without a man in her life , takes out a personal ad for erin "
1,"field of dreams almost defies description  
although it's about baseball , it's not a baseball movie  
although the film is extremely spiritual , it's not about religion  
and although field of dreams is melodramatic , it's not a tearjerker  
to really understand what field of dreams is all about , you have to see it  
in the film , kevin costner plays ray kinsella , a baseball fan , '60s berkeley graduate , and iowa farmer  
one day as he is standing in the middle of his expansive corn fields , ray hears a voice ; it tells him : "" if you build it , he will come  "" 
then ray has a vision and somehow concludes that if he builds a baseball field in the middle of his corn , shoeless joe jackson will arise from the dead to play ball once again  
and even though it depletes his family's savings and his neighbors think he's crazy , ray clears away the corn and builds a baseball field , complete with bleachers and flood lights "
1,"natural born killers is really a very simple story that , in essence , has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis , mood and degree  
both films glamorize "" outlaws , "" in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers

but where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle , natural born killers is total and blatant  
where bonnie & clyde was social , natural born killers is psychological

what bonnie and clyde stole , mickey and mallory kill  
to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them , expressed metaphorically as killing , subdues the mysterious power this film wields

1,"one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel  
that concept , although many purists doubt its scientific credentials , spawned many interesting novels , comic books and films in the last century

1,"it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship , a green ovular pin , and the birth of oscar wilde , but if one really strains , they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off  
wilde's philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature , and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned , loosing his family and his career  
the glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise  
the main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life ( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality ) , they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else  
and that's why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began  
it's been said that todd haynes' "" velvet goldmine , "" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement , not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it , steals a lot from "" citizen kane , "" and that's true  
in the film , a british journalist in the 80s , arthur stuart ( christian bale ) , is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade , a fictitious rock star , who faked his own death on stage , bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement  
structure-wise , this totally steals from "" kane , "" not only from the set-up ( he interviews three people , and the story is a result of their flashbacks ) , but in other things , like the beginning ( death , then newsreel ) , and smaller details , like the bitter ex-friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex-wife as a washed-up lounge singer , found in a bar after hours  
this is no "" kane , "" and it really doesn't aspire to be : it doesn't attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like "" kane "" did , and it doesn't really uncover anything poignant about humanity "

the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job , and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life  
the outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why  
what comes into question is their opinions on life and death , on god and morality , and on how they make a living  
these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch "
1,"susan granger's review of "" osmosis jones "" ( warner bros  ) 
if the farrelly brothers taught anatomy & physiology in school , no one would cut ever class  
this hip , live action/animation story begins as a monkey snatches a hard-boiled egg from frank , a zookeeper ( bill murray ) , who grabs it back , drops it , then gobbles up the contaminated morsel , explaining , "" if it hits and ground and you pick it up within 10 seconds , you can eat it  "" 
like "" fantastic voyage "" ( 1966 ) , the pseudo-science animation then takes over when his body's immune system contacts traffic control as an ingested virus hits the digestive system : "" be on the alert for illegal organisms ! "" 
eager to right "" a stomach evacuation mistake "" he once made , a cocky , clever , courageous white blood cell ( chris rock ) declares , "" this is a crime scene ! "" 
and teams up with a conscientious "" phi beta capsule "" 12-hour cold remedy called drixenol ( david hyde pierce ) to chase down and destroy the deadly "" red death "" virus ( laurence fishburne ) that's determined to take frank down in 48 hours , beating ebola and e  coli to a medical record  
watch out for mucus mudslides , chaos in cerebellum hall and the detritus from booger dam ( runny nose ) , along with comic turns from molly shannon and chris elliot , plus the voices of william shatner and brandy norwood  
peter and bobby farrelly , along with writer mark hyman and animation directors piet kroon and tom sito , have turned their penchant for gross-out comedy , encompassing flatulence , festering sores and "" popping a pimple without a permit , "" into a funny , farrelly-funny family film  
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" osmosis jones "" is a wildly imaginative , original , explosive 7  
and perhaps , as they're laughing , kids will learn where to find their uvula , along with nuggets about nutrition and hygiene "
1,"there is a scene early in soul food , george tillman's comedy-drama about a large african-american family and the ordeals they go through during a crisis , that caught me completely off guard

being the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone ) , this film is his most successful effort yet  
perhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc  ) , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause )

1,"susan granger's review of "" songcatcher "" in the midst of this summer's fare of dinos revisited and romantic fiascoes , there are a few thoughtful movies - and this appalachian period drama is one  
oscar nominee janet mcteer ( "" tumbleweeds "" ) stars as dr  lily penleric , an accomplished musicologist who , back in that pre-feminist era , was refused a full professorship at her university  
determined to prove her worth , she ventures deep into the rugged mountains of north carolina , where her younger sister elna ( jane adams ) runs a school  
there in bear creek , she discovers a treasure-trove of traditional scots-irish and english folk ballads , given a unique interpretation by the insular locals  
excited , she sends for recording equipment and persuades vinie butler ( pat carroll ) and other self-sustaining mountain folk to share their musical heritage on her edison phonograph cylinders  
their music , as she puts it , is "" as much a part of life here as the air you breathe  "" 
that's the main thrust of writer-director maggie greenwald's occasionally uneven culture-clash story , which is loosely based on olive dame campbell's foray through the blue ridge mountains in 1908 , but there's also some melodramatic romantic spice

people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict , as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee  
the story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves

a strange mixture of _shine_ , _basquiat_ , _angel heart_ , and grant morrison & dave mckean's graphic novel "" arkham asylum "" , _the caveman's valentine_ is a feverish tale of a homeless madman-cum-detective who , on the morning of february 14th , discovers a "" valentine "" just outside his new york cave : one of ella fitzgerald's strange fruit , stuck in the crotch of a tree--a young male model murdered and frozen to a branch  
believing at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant , shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building , is responsible for the murder , romulus ( samuel l  jackson ) is put on the trail of an avant-garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould , david leppenraub ( colm feore )

every moment an exhausting workshop of ideas , and every character the same , _the caveman's valentine_ is a concept so "" high concept "" that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment , with romulus's "" caveman "" a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane's urban noir hero , spawn  
with a long-vanished wife ( tamara tunie ) acting as a spiritual guide , the occasional social caste commentary , the secret base in a cave , a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters , and a wickedly colourful arch-enemy , the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren't inscribed with "" gotham pd  ""

obviously , the film's creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature-length movie out of his hilarious vh1/vogue fashion awards short-film subject : can there be more to this film than being really really really silly ? 
no , of course not , and it never aspires to be anything more  
much like derek , zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie  
it's not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy , and it never produces any gut-busting laughs ( except maybe a scene when derek's model roommates all die in a tragic "" gasoline fight "" accident -- a riotously funny take-off of tommy hilfiger ads )  
but it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles , wild characters and performances , and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused  
better yet , this exaggerated version of the original three-minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes -- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag

for adults , it's a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids

but now i fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against -- the winner of seven academy awards in 1963 for best picture , director , editing , cinematography , art direction , music , and sound  
after watching the film again , i am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen  
based on the autobiographical writing of british officer t  e  
lawrence during world war i , lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence ( played by then-unknown actor peter o'toole ) as a lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever "
1,"elizabeth is a potent historical drama set in england in the mid-1500s

little does england know that a young woman named elizabeth ( cate blanchett ) will be their greatest hope for survival

as the final scene closed out in happy slow-mo fashion , i felt happy to have been priveleged enough to watch such a good display of filmmaking  
jason schwartzman , his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces and glasses , steals the show as max fischer , the most well known rushmore academy student who gets terrible grades , but compensates for it by organizing most of the school's clubs and organizations ( i  e  
the fencing team and writing and producing school plays ) and often pulling outrageous stunts , one that eventually earns him an expulsion

1,"the last steve martin film i saw , the spanish prisoner , was a very different approach for the comic actor  
as a millionaire leading a massive conspiracy in order to rob "" a process "" from a clueless businessman , martin's character did it all for money  
in his most recent movie , bowfinger , martin plays yet another con man except this time he does it to succeed in the film industry  
he wants to direct a successful picture that will force people to remember his name , that will make him more popular at the parties , and , most importantly , that will cause fed ex to deliver important business packages to his front door  
playing the title role , martin is once again the good guy ; the one we cheer for to complete his low budget action movie  
this con man is very likeable for some reason , even though he is doing the same exact thing as the malicious jimmy del from the spanish prisoner  
maybe the message is that , in hollywood , to win over the trust and friendship of others , you have to be a little evil  
bowfinger is a very clever comedy with great performances from its two stars  
martin , who also wrote the screenplay , is perfect as a jerk with a conscience and eddie murphy does his best "" peter sellers "" in two different , but equally hilarious , roles ; one as a big time move star and the other as his nerdy , burger king employee brother "

then there are the brethren who populate the apple orchard where homer wells finds himself shortly after leaving st  cloud's , including delroy lindo , oscar ? -worthy as the foreman of the migrant work detail that drifts up and down the coast as the seasons take them  
there's kate nelligan as the matriarch of the cider house , and charlize theron as candy , the lovely , lonely wife of a wwii bomber pilot ( paul rudd ) sent away on a mission overseas leaving candy to set lobster traps with homer wells , a man who's never seen the ocean before let alone a lobster

1,"synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners  
cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves  
technically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave  
lawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men  
three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery  
a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters  
opinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life  
in fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion  
real life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved "
1,"john sayles' "" men with guns "" is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power  
the film takes place in an unnamed central american country , where the men with guns are the rulers  
most of the country is divided into tiny segments - some are controlled by guerrillas with guns , some are controlled by army soldiers with guns , and all the spaces in-between are controlled by thieves , bandits , and terrorists  
all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness  
however , like so many central american countries , this one also features modernity  
there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization : skyscrapers , hospitals , televisions , highways , etc  but , it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land , or else they are simply ignorant of it

much of the book spares tinseltown from mockery , although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview , in a fine chapter called "" in search of the wily filipino  "" 
now , as writer and star of bowfinger , he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema , perhaps finally venting the frustrations ( 'everything being made now is crap' ) that led to his brief retirement from hollywood  
martin stars as bobby bowfinger , a roger corman-wannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer , quality of the projects be damned  
his accountant ( adam alexi-malle ) proposes a movie called "" chubby rain , "" about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops

ramsey , of course , wants nothing to do with such low-grade material , so bowfinger , on the thinking that action stars need to run , not speak , decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously  
he sends his cast members ( who aren't in on it , either ; they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co-stars ) to ramsey's table at restaurants , asks them to follow him in parking lots , etc  , spouting script dialogue , all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance "

modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes  
the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it  
 "" your friends and neighbors "" takes a different approach as it's a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends  
one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute's basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story  
firstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras

the first act of the film provides us with an inside look into the lives of a group of men from a small community who work and hang out together

1," "" last night "" could have an "" aka "" tagged on the end of it that says , "" it's the end of the world , and we feel fine ""  
 "" last night "" is about just that  
the last night of planet earth's existence  
the world is going to end at precisely midnight , january 1st , 2000  
how scientists were so accurately able to predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained  
nor is the event itself  
throughout the entire movie , no explanation is given as to why this is happening  
in doing this , mckellar ( who also wrote and directed the film ) seems to be trying to transcend the genre  
he's attempted to make a film about people , and how each of them deals with their last night of life "
1,"this british import follows the ( mis- ) adventures of a group of heroin crazed scottish youths  
there is marc renton ( who narrates ) , spud ( the dim-witted one ) sick boy ( the sean connery obsessive ) , and begbee ( the violence obsessive )  
powered by a top rate , but not top name soundtrack ( iggy pop , sleeper , elastica , lou reed    ) the film follows renton who gets clean , gets back into heroin and gets clean again  
some of the wit in this movie is sharp and pulp fiction-esque , and some is just dumb & dumber gross ( the bed sheets ) and stupid ( the bb gun ) although the film starts out on a comic note , it takes a sharp term in the middle , and becomes almost depressing  
the film is based on an irving welsh novel bearing the same title  
i can honestly say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen "
1,"`run lola run' , a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival , is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance  
for a berserk and retroactive 81 minutes of non-stop movement , we follow a fiery-haired heroine named lola ( franka potente ) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers  
lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100 , 000 marks in time to save manni ( moritz bleibtreu ) from being killed by the dealer  
but , in something of a pseudo- `groundhog day' approach , director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal  
in these trio of episodes , we gradually learn the unique effects of fate , for even if tiny changes are made in lola's journey , the future can be seriously altered  
`run lola run' is an experience like `fight club' or `the matrix' , in that each film takes you through a super-charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways  
in addition , all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack  
`lola' is no exception , with stylish quick-flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get-go  
tykwer's world is a landscape of mood and color , with brilliant shades of red and pink ( including lola's fiery hair ) used as effective symbolism throughout "

zane is having marital problems at the time , and an offer by her to spend the night with him is very tempting

1," "" very bad things , "" is the most delightfully morbid film of the year , a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldn't help but be won over by the material  
the film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas  
the groom-to-be is kyle fisher ( jon favreau ) , who is about to be married to the controlling , wedding-obsessed laura ( cameron diaz )  
the other friends are real estate agent robert boyd ( christian slater ) , quiet charles ( leland orser ) , and brothers , michael ( jeremy piven ) and family man adam ( daniel stern )

1,"it's rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year , but that is what disney and pixar animation ; s latest film represents  
while a bugs life isn't nearly as deep as it's predecessor , dreamwork's antz , it is just as funny  
a bug's life centers , appropriately , around the life of an ant , named flik  
flik , cutely voiced by newsradio's david foley , hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task  
when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost , the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way  
the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them

1,"the "" italian hitchcock "" and acknowledged master of the giallo murder-mystery dario argento again offers us a fascinating turn on the formula in pheneomena  
this time the twist comes in the form of jennifer corvino ( jennifer connelly ) , a bright teenager with gift for telepathically communicating with insects  
sent to a girls boarding school in switzerland , she soon learns of a series of bizarre disappearances and at least one murder that has the school's population terrified  
a chance meeting with a brilliant entomologist ( donald pleasance ) leads the two of them to team up and solve the mystery with the aid of her remarkable gift  
phenomena is an imaginative , original thriller  
writer/director argento creates several sequences of surreal , haunting beauty here , including a masterfully shot sleepwalking episode and a striking scene when a swarm of flying insects descends on the school at jennifer's beckoning  
the plot takes some wonderfully bizarre turns and the killer's identity is genuinely shocking and surprising  
the director took a big gamble with a soundtrack that mixes elements as diverse as heavy metal band iron maiden , ex-rolling stone bill wyman , and argento's favourite gothic/electronic outfit goblin  
but it gels surprisingly well "

the plot is mostly straightforward suspense with little nonsense

i am sure i must have seen almost the identical plot before  
this is a heist film made for an adult audience who probably wanted a crime film like they had seen in theaters when they were teens

there are no ballet- like martial arts "
1,"that's the question i asked myself when venturing nervously into "" the wedding singer , "" the latest film to star the saturday night live alumnus  
does he draw laughs from his sad , puppy dog expression and don't-hate-me-for-being-a-simpleton observations ? 
or do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people ? 
or is it just the fact that he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over ? 
well , there's a little bit of all of that in "" the wedding singer "" and while i exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr  sandler's thing , i did have a surprisingly good time  
that's because , in a nutshell , "" the wedding singer "" is one of the sweetest movies you're ever likely to come across

1,"118 minutes ; not rated ( though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language ) 
mamoru oshii is a name that probably isn't very well-known to most american audiences , but perhaps it should be  
oshii was the director of last year's best-known japanese animated film import , _ghost in the shell_ , and is known among fans of japanese animation , or anime , for making films with a deep philosophical bent  
one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series  
in its many incarnations--graphic novels ( "" manga "" ) , two different runs of made-for-video episodes ( original animation videos , or oavs for short ) , and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes--patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan  
set in the very near future ( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived ) , this atypical giant robot anime features the characters , rather than the machinery , as the primary focus  
as a whole , patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan  
as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains , giant industrial robots , known as "" labors "" ( an interesting play on words , considering that "" robot "" is derived from the czech word for labor ) , have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century  
with the rise of labors , however , has come a new menace--labor crime

it really scared me , and i didn't want to go see it  
however , after i heard about how wonderful it was , i wanted to see it  
i didn't get a chance to do so , until now  
the film , disney's 25th animated feature , opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale : a long time ago in the land of prydain , there was a king so evil , that his spirit was captured in the cauldron  
it has been hidden for centuries , and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors , and with them rule the world ? and destroy it

now let's say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway , and offers you more than it's worth

not about to take this lying down , darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined , albeit pathetic , attempt to fight back

1,"the calendar year has not even reached its midway point , but that hasn't prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscar-bait season  
bille august's high-profile adaptation of victor hugo's classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epic--handsome production values , strong performances by a top-notch cast , a literate screenplay--with one critically missing element : emotional sweep  
for those not familiar with hugo's original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired , the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like a 19th-century french-set version of the fugitive  
after serving 19 years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread , the brutish jean valjean ( liam neeson ) is paroled  
immediately upon release , he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a night ; he is caught by authorities , only to be forgiven by the bishop , who lets valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow  
that he does , and in doing so breaks his parole , which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) , who was one of the guards in valjean's prison camp , on his trail  
thematically , however , les miserables is a story about redemption , which valjean finds through his dealings with two women , the hard-luck factory-worker-turned-prostitute fantine ( uma thurman ) , and her illegitimate daughter , cosette  
years after breaking parole , valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau , where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert

the summer of raunch continues to spread into theatres with this latest yuk fest , filled with sick jokes and teen dialogue aplenty  
if you go expecting dawson's creek , you're in for a problem  
if your expectations are lower ( and better , i might add ) , you will enjoy the hell out of american pie

throughout the movie , little sick comic bits are sprinkled throughout , including a memorable scene involving an apple pie ( i won't give it away , but you probably know what it is ) and an internet broadcast gone horribly awry  
of course , the movie has some slightly sentimental bits , but they don't drag the movie's humor content down that bad

1,"when i was growing up in 1970s , boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences  
the first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions  
the latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life  
decades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids  
yes , most of the kung fu and other "" martial arts "" flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills  
but , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation  
the best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon  
made in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee's skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience  
it succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor "

1," "" psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred ""  
a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget , third rate rip-off  
but no , this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria , perhaps italian horror director dario argento's most consistently successful film  
what impresses most in re-watching this surrealistic , supernatural thriller is that argento's directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near-fully coherent narrative  
screenplays have always been his achilles heel ; confusing subplots , gaping holes , totally illogical incidents and reactions  
no question : argento has always been a better director than a writer  
fortunately , he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria , taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called "" suspiria de profundis ""

quickly enamored of each other , the two embark upon an on-again , off-again love affair replete with romance , humor , and the occasional lump in the throat  
the film opens with a non-verbal cue to anna's stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress's appearances in films and at premieres - coming out of limousines , walking the red carpets and such  
without words , this sequence gives us a background to her character  
following , however , is a set-up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives  
i don't know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn't have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie's beginning , but there it is

but first , bowfinger must get renowned action star kit ramsey ( eddie murphy ) to sign in on the project "
1," "" six days , seven nights "" is a summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right , a commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered with some pretty uneven fare  
here's a genuinely fun fluff piece that knows it's fluff , recognizes it's fluff and is admittedly proud to be fluff  
of course , the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movie's success ; ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor that it's easy to forget what a funny guy he can be  
as his female counterpart , anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back for her sweet , goofily charismatic performance  
the age difference ( ford's 56 , heche's 29 ) matters not -- these two click in a charged way that's hard to come by  
the story is a no-brainer -- ford stars as gruff but loveable island aviator quinn harris , while heche is career-minded but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe  
robin , on a tropical vacation with fianc ? frank ( david schwimmer ) , gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti , so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there  
the plane crashes during a terrible storm , and they immediately find themselves stuck in a deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back to civilization  
a series of unpleasant , often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice but for both members of this unlikely odd couple to fall for each other "

he does this , and shortly after gets tied up in a kidnapping caper "
1,"there's an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last  
george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy  
return of the jedi , the final installment of the series , is easily the most innovative , action-packed , and entertaining of the three films  
the dark , eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone

exotica is a film that grows on retrospection  
exotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film  
all of the people know each other , but apart from that , there seems to be no other reason why to select such set and follow them in this fictional account  
the director hints for possible solutions , using a multi-line plot , so popular with critics in mystery train , and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction  
exotica reaches a whole new dimension using this technique

1,"with his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there , and his latest , hearts in atlantis , is no different  
its structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile , which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books  
the parallels don't end there , either  
atlantis was adapted by william goldman , who had previously penned the big-screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king's dreamcatcher  
even the film's content is a bit reminiscent of mile  
in fact , it's the perfect blend of the feel-good '60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile  
king's atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories , but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale , called low men in yellow coats ( the film's title comes from the second chapter )  
it's set in 1960 harwich , connecticut , where 11-year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house run by his cold , self-centered mother elizabeth ( hope davis , joe gould's secret ) , who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son  
bobby spends his time with his two closest friends , john sullivan ( will rothhaar ) and tomboy carol gerber ( mika boorem ) , who become something like the kevin , paul and winnie of harwich "

christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman , a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc ? e and his colleagues  
it seems that bateman is a serial killer and , unfortunately for his contemporaries , his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip  
as he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co-workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies , his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel  
i was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school  
i read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it  
as usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out , but i soon forgot about the novel and didn't end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore

1,"john von neumann , progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project , pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos , even without recourse to faster-than light travel  
you send out self-replicating robot ships which explore and radio back information  
it may take decades , centuries , or millennia , but it can be done with achievable technology , and doesn't require a magical faster-than-light drive  
in the fifties , british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it ; any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer , which would then engage in a real-time dialog with the aliens , exchanging information and technologies , and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned  
about thirty-five years ago , the bbc contracted with astronomer/writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini-series called a for andromeda  
afa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission , the construction of a huge computer , the computer's analysis of life on earth , and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication  
she was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then-unknown julie christie  
audience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel , andromeda breakthrough , which played to equally high ratings

1,"wong kar-wei's "" fallen angels "" is , on a purely visceral level , one of the most exciting films i've seen in a long while

1,"near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king  
the following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia  
at best , that's all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry

dreamworks' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed  
the other two contenders , warner brothers' quest for camelot and disney's own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively  
although camelot was borderline-abysmal , and can't really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner

instead , reese travels out to their lake tahoe home and lures beau out to the boat house where beau learns that his mother was right about reese

but her troubles are just beginning , as she soon learns with the arrival of blackmailer alek spera ( goran visnjic , "" practical magic "" ) in "" the deep end  "" 
the incredibly pale , red-headed scottish actress swinton immerses herself into the role of the reserved american super-mom whose life revolves around serving the needs of her three children and live-in father-in-law jack ( peter donat , "" the game "" )  
she shows great strength while allowing other emotions to glimmer through - discomfort at challenging reese in his gay disco ( named the deep end ) , near panic at having to dive down to his body to retrieve car keys , or even wry humor when an attempt to get help from jack becomes hopelessly miscommunicated  
gradually her loneliness becomes apparent ( her husband's a naval officer , usually away at sea ) when her attempts to email him her concerns about beau are deleted and later , when a most unusual , yet chaste , romance turns tragic

the motto was well chosen  
the series was simple , it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies , including the evil daleks , and the master , who appears in this feature , played very badly by eric roberts  
as good as this revival was , there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who

paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who've played the doctor ( including his predecessor and off-screen friend sylvester mccoy , who appears once more for the regeneration scene )  
he looks right for the role , is a brilliant actor , and slips effortlessly into the role , the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would

1,"the happy bastard's 30-second review 
big daddy 
happy gilmore as a father ? 
of course ! 
that's the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy , a movie that's passable but isn't really considered some of sandler's best work  
he doesn't actually play happy gilmore in the movie , but a variation of him  
he's sonny coufax , a man who's living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his one-day-a-week gig as a tollbooth man ( tollbooth willie ? )  
his girlfriend ( kristy swanson ) is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him  
enter a 5-year old kid , who's mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate ( jon stewart ) , who's off in china on a business trip  
from there , coufax basically acts as the kid's father , teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks  
he even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker ( joey lauren adams ) , but , somehow , he also garners the attention of social services , who aren't particularly pleased with coufax's actions , as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid  
the reason i say it's not really sandler's best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie , showing some odd feelings that somehow didn't really belong in a sandler vehicle  
i mean , it fits the movie's tone and everything , and sandler handles it well , but it's just oddly placed , that's all "
1,"for example , in happy gilmore , sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self-confident jerk of a pro  
if the star were any other comic , that would be enough motivation to drive the movie , but with sandler , the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house  
that extra motive doesn't make happy gilmore a funnier movie  
it doesn't really add any genuine emotional depth , either  
in fact , the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie  
but sandler's philosophy seems to be , if it's a token gesture , why not make it a nice gesture ? 
that is endlessly refreshing  
in the wedding singer , sandler is right on track  
the fact that he's a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story  
what kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important "

robert redford's film version of nicholas evans' best-selling novel was supposed to have been in theaters last december , going head-to-head with "" titanic , "" but is only now making its much anticipated debut

1,"if you thought baz luhrmann's radical take on _william_shakespeare's_romeo_+_juliet_ was wild , wait until what you see what tony award-winning stage director julie taymor ( _the_lion_king : _the_broadway_musical_ ) does to the bard's _titus_andronicus_ for her audacious--and very bloody--film debut  
while luhrmann transplanted the star-crossed lovers to 1990s florida , taymor keeps this grisly tale of revenge in rome--but places it in a surreal temporal limbo  
the colosseum suggests the proper time of imperial rome , but high rises and heavy duty kitchen ovens suggest the 1990s , while the vintage automobiles and some costumes are more '40s and '50s , and other garments are more gladiator-like  
as tamora , queen of goths ( jessica lange ) exacts revenge on roman general titus ( anthony hopkins ) for killing her eldest son , and he does the same to her for the wrongs she commits , taymor obviously wanted to express the timeless relevance of the story's underlying themes  
however , the time convergence approach only works at times , for often it's just distracting , as in one scene where tamora's suviving sons ( matthew rhys and jonathan rhys meyers ) blow off steam playing video arcade games  
taymor didn't have to resort to such avant garde time tricks , for the story would have resonated just as strongly had she jettisoned them  
she is a strong storyteller and a master visual stylist , the latter compliment encompassing all areas , makeup and costume choices as well as those in the editing and photography departments  
she also has a sure way with actors ; hopkins' titus is at once tragic and horrifying , and lange is sultry as the viperous tamora  
the clear standout of the cast , however , is harry lennix as aaron , a moor who is tamora's secret lover and a schemer in his own right "

'holocaust comedy receives standing ovation' , the headlines read  
intrigued by this statement , i looked up information on the film and found that , sure enough , life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years  
even though the movie was extremely well-received by critics and public alike , i couldn't help but be disgusted at this notion ; human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated  
only now do i see the error of my ways  
after finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time , it became clear that it is not , as the headlines proclaimed , a "" holocaust comedy "" ; on the contrary , life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps  
rather , it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son , who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation  
roberto benigni ( who also wrote and directed the movie ) stars as guido orefice , a chaplin-inspired clown and all round jolly guy who , as the film opens , is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher ( nicoletta braschi , benigni real life spouse )  
through the course of the first hour or so , we see guido striving to get the attention of this "" beautiful princess "" , as he calls her "
1,"before you read my review , you gotta know that i love woody allen  
this is a very important note because allen's films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone  
i know folks who believe him to be a complete genius , while others see him as a dirty ol' schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again  
i love most of his films , but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the 90s  
in fact , why he felt the need to make 10 movies in those 10 years is beyond me ! 
if you look at the quality of those films , you'll hear what i'm saying  
the only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives  
in fact , i secretly hoped that he would take some "" time off "" at the turn of the millennium , just to re-energize or something , but it doesn't appear as though he has any intention of doing that  
so here i am again , reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old

death decides to take a holiday , what with all the rigors of soul-collecting and all , and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it's like to be human  
death assumes the body of brad pitt , and from there , much trouble ensues  
for one thing , death-as-pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter , played by claire forlani

i mean that as the highest compliment  
if most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40-year-old romance , i'd want to run and hide  
the sex scenes would be handled as a farce , producers would shed 20 years off the characters' ages ( so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star ) and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence  
along with a charming romantic story , the australian/belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable  
the romance gets started when former musician andreas ( charles "" bud "" tingwell ) , learns that his true love , claire ( julia blake ) , lives nearby  
they decide to catch up on old times , but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair  
complicating matters is andreas' frail health , and claire's longtime husband ( terry norris ) , who can't understand why he's suddenly become obsolete

1,"full metal jacket , very much like every other hard-hitting film about the vietnam war , is an shocking , emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america  
this film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man ( private joker , played by matthew modine ) during his tour in the vietnam war  
however , full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before : boot camp  
these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film , even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning  
as in platoon , full metal jacket gets off to a quick start  
the opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits , which is getting their heads shaved  
from there , they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman , played extremely well by the former drill instructor r  lee ermey  
apparently , the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies , because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations "

1,"slavery is bad  
after hundreds of years , we've finally figured that one out  
this almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg's latest "" serious "" film

1,"the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do  
lives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice  
the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower  
most of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants  
it takes a pretty smart person to do that  
but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? 
what if he's also able to think on his feet ?

1,"the film "" magnolia "" can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests

1,"weir is well-respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject-matter into deceptively simple , powerful films , the mosquito coast ( utopia ) and fearless ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) among them  
in the truman show , weir essentially breathes life into the now-tired concept of media-manipulation by tackling the material from the inside-out  
it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top-form playing the title character , truman burbank  
by now you must be aware of the premise : unbeknownst to him , truman ( carrey ) is the star of his own tv series , a 24-7 peep-show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations ; people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants  
`seahaven' , his hometown , and the show itself , are the brainchild of christof ( harris ) , who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon , directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras  
for 30 years , truman suspects nothing-`we accept the reality we're given , ' poses christof-but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in `fiji' ( mcelhone , who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement ) overwhelms him  
thus , christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact , lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly-rated program  
in a few broad strokes , weir creates a convincing second-reality , and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three-quarters through

1,"susan granger's review of "" hearts in atlantis "" ( castle rock/warner bros  ) 
timing is everything , and the timing just seems right for this poignant psychological drama that combines the coming-of-age nostalgia of "" stand by me "" with the mystical power of "" the green mile  "" 
based on stephen king stories adapted by screenwriter william goldman and directed by scott hicks , it's set in 1960 in harwich , connecticut , where fatherless 11 year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house with his resentful , self-centered mother ( hope davis )  
he's devoted to his neighborhood friends ( mika boorem , will rothhaar ) but his pivotal relationship is with a strange , new tenant , ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins ) who opens the world of literature to him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him a birthday gift and hands him , instead , a library card  
knowing he's longing for a schwinn bike , ted offers to pay him $1 a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for signs of the malevolent , ominous low men who are chasing him to exploit his special powers  
the story structure consists of one long flashback , framed by the present , featuring the adult bobby ( david morse ) , minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama hopkins' mysterious character is genteel , sensitive and benignly seductive  
the only explanation is that he's a psychic who is wanted by the fbi to aid in their hunt for communists and even that seems appropriate , given the inexplicable state of the world right now  
the production values and performances are solid , particularly hopkins - arguably the finest , most versatile actor of our era - and the children with whom he forges a firm bond  
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" hearts in atlantis "" is a wistful , enigmatic 8 , evolving with subtle power to an emotionally effective catharsis "

in her directorial debut , bastard out of carolina , based upon dorothy allison's largely autobiographical book on child abuse and poverty in the south , huston displays impressive proficiency behind the camera as well  
the film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright , nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth , in post-world war ii south carolina

even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience  
on the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view  
this film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life  
the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense  
instead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters  
although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini's fascist regime  
amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don't like federico fellini's work very much  
every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible "

the very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast-talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city  
gibson's performance is terrific , and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films  
gibson again teams up with richard donner , as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick , and this time around , the combination works even better  
the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique  
try to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle who , this time around , is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover-ups  
if you can imagine that , then you've basically got jerry fletcher "
1,"scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well  
during a film-class discussion , windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are , and why sequels never live up to the originals  
a few rare exceptions are noted , but they left out one  
  
  
scream 2 ! 
1996's surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america ! 
a sequel was unavoidable , but luckily the re-teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment  
in fact , at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream , i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film ! 
sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro , ca in the original scream , is now two years older and off to college , majoring in theater  
meanwhile , tv journalist gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who covered the murders in the first film , has since written a book about the dreadful events ; a book titled "" stab "" , which has been developed into a major motion picture  
as scream 2 opens , a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of "" stab "" , and before long , a young couple are butchered to death , unnoticed in the midst of hysteria "

1,"taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking , go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers  
the story centres around a group of people , who include brit simon ( askew ) , and checkout girls claire ( holmes ) and ronna ( polley ) and the misadventures that they get into , split into three chapters  
everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers  
although qt's touch is evident in nearly every frame , go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride  
liman , who also photographed the film , has a deft touch with the camera , and the film looks good  
the film also seems to have benefited from a budget , with the night-club scenes in particular looking pretty good  
there's a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk  
the young cast are talented and help bring the story to life  
holmes , one of the dawson's creek cast ( a show i'm not particularly fond of ) displays much talent here , and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature "

1,"the question isn't why has grease been reissued  
the answer to that one is easy : to celebrate the movie's 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramount's coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity  
no , the question that ought to be asked is : should grease be reissued ? 
the answer is not an easy one  
grease is a fun movie , an entertaining fantasy of the '50s , embodying all the cliches of that era  
the music is lively and the dance numbers , choreographed by patricia birch , are energetic and high-spirited  
travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon , cool , but non-threatening

through its various dramas , spielberg presents a case about a group of africans , who , after being seized from their home , were forced onto a ship and sent to the united states aboard "" la amistad ""  
on their way there , the slaves , led by cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , rebelled , killing off part of the crew

watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is  
aside from the fact that it's a milestone in animation in movies ( it's the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters , have them interact , and make it convincingly real ) and a great entertainment it's also quite an effective comedy/mystery  
while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original , especially baby herman , and watching them together is a lot of fun  
the story begins in hollywood in 1947  
cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work , so hard-boiled private detective eddie valiant ( bob hoskins ) is called in by studio head r  k  
maroon ( alan tilvern ) to try to help get roger's mind back on work

don't let the film's cheesy dissuade you  
following this sideshow of horror-lab special effects we are plunged quickly into a non-stop exploration of the weirdness that is leuchter's life and mind  
morris follows the trail of leuchter's madness with appalling lucidity , revealing in a surprising and frightening way what most of us could have guessed to begin with : this leuchter guy is seriously messed up

and while this uproariously funny , gross-out summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste , it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end  
american pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage-targeted fare this season  
i must question the studio that releases a movie like this  
the producers are aiming these films at the 15-24 crowd , but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an r-rated film  
some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc-17 , a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie  
american pie was threatened with an nc-17 , but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product , it was given an r  but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park

1,"lisa cholodenko's "" high art , "" is an intelligent , quiet drama  
its strongest quality , aside from the top-notch central performances , is the perceptive way in which the film , also written by cholodenko , observes its characters  
they are all flawed people , some more troubled than others , but they are not judged  
judging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers' parts , because no one , no matter how bad off they are , deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of

1,"richard linklater's "" slacker , "" made in 1991 for a budget of only $23 , 000 , immerses itself in the twentysomething , college-town culture of austin , texas  
most of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning  
their lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue a career after graduation ; they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy , the pervasiveness of slave morality , the subtle messages in pop culture , and such  
ask them what they've been doing lately , and they'll more likely than not reply , "" oh , you know , just hanging out  "" 
linklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters : the camera follows one person for a few minutes , then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person , who walks into a diner just as another person is walking out the door  
  
  
  
it's certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk : some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas , some of them are just plain weird , and some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are "
1,"brian depalma needs a hit * really * badly  
since scoring big with the untouchables in 1987 , depalma has seen casualties of war , raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames  
consequently , it would be easy enough to consider carlito's way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma , reteaming with al pacino ( scarface ) and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes  
it doesn't hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn  
carlito's way , while hampered by depalma's characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism , is a truly tense and engrossing drama  
carlito brigante ( pacino ) is a life-long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance  
in 1975 , carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality

1,"after hearing reviews for woody allen's upteenth movie in history , "" celebrity , "" range from terribly boring to just so-so , my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of "" manhattan , "" my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time  
woody allen's films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair , so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand-in-hand ( "" manhattan "" really is one of the best-looking films i've ever seen , beautiful black and white photography of the city's best areas , etc  ) , a fan can't help but feel visibly moved  
the film opens up , with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds , and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack , but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky , with the word "" help "" being spelled with an airplane  
beethoven's 5th blasts on the soundtrack  
the city seems to stop to take notice of this moment , and it's all rather lovely to look at  
and then we cut to a film crew , shooting this as the film's hilariously banal key moment in the film , where the lead actress in the film ( melanie griffith , looking as buxom and beautiful as ever ) has to realize something's wrong with her life or whatever  
it's a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film , with the great opening shots or without , and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again , a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works ( though , for the record , last year's "" deconstructing harry "" came awfully close )

bulworth is a far better film than these , both in its execution and lasting impression  ?

one day , she falls upon something , and believes that her ticket to happiness may be in helping others  
she starts with the people around her , but when she suddenly falls for her own guy , she can't act strongly enough because of her shy and dreamy nature  
critique : a clever , quirky , original french flick set in a picturesque paris , featuring an endearing lead with a giant imagination , much loneliness and a little bit of love for everyone  
this is a "" feel-good "" kind of movie , a fairy tale for grown-ups who are bummed out about life  
it doesn't pretend to be deep , it doesn't weigh itself down with long expositions or intricate studies of its characters , it's basically just a "" cute movie "" in the same vein as chocolat and pay it forward , with some amazing visuals and incredibly nice intentions ( and if chocolat was somehow able to nab an oscar nomination for best picture last year ( a sham on so many different levels ) , you might as well slap this film up for consideration also , since it's quite a bit better and much more original than the former )  
one thing that this film isn't though , at least according to me , is the best film of the year ( it was bestowed the honor of "" best "" in at least 3 different film festivals so far this year )  
it actually managed to stagnate a little bit about halfway through and it just went on for way too long ( it's a little over two hours but it felt even longer ) , with much of the second half of the movie devoted to many different characters , all of whom weren't as interesting as the lead , and a lot of indecisiveness from ms  amelie herself , which got frustrating "

and if there wasn't anything more to the movie than this , it would be a second-rate heist comedy at best , enlivened by great actors -- like sneakers goes to washington  
 ( a heist comedy ? 
yup  
deniro and hoffman are "" stealing "" the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else  ) 
wag the dog succeeds because it's based one great truth : the american people are stupid  
ok , maybe it's not "" love thy neighbor as thyself "" or even "" two plus two makes four "" , but a truth nonetheless

that is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find , to their big surprise , that the majority of people vote republican , go to church every sunday and usually don't tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film  
such rude awakening , however , can happen in another direction - conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in  
something like that happens to jake van dorn ( george c  scott ) , successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community  
one day his daughter kristen ( ilah davis ) disappears from calvinist youth convention in california  
van dorn is worried because he doesn't believe that his daughter would run from home

infuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way mast's investigation is going , so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself "

[light spoilers , nothing you shouldn't read] 
existenz has been called "" a gooey matrix "" , and while this is a correct description in some ways , in others it is completely off  
the only thing the two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal , "" real "" reality  
a major difference is that "" the matrix "" has a base reality that is obviously the true reality , while existenz does the impossible and makes us accept the most bizarre reality ever as true  
and oh what a reality it is  
david cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies ( naked lunch , crash ) , but this one is one of the strangest  
maybe it's because of how the mundane is mixed with the bizarre  
technology is organic , but only some of it "
1,"the film starts out with a creepy opening sequence to which has the now classic and creepy score by writer/director/producer john carpenter who in my mind is a brilliant director , he really is  
he wrote this film , he directed this film , he produced this film and he made the excessively creepy score to this film  
i think he is and always will be famous for this classic which after 21 years has not lost it's popularity or it's ability to scare the wits out of people  
i think i have seen 'halloween' over 100 times and each time i find something new and brilliant , and each time i am scared even though i know what is going to happen  
i own three different versions of the film : a vhs regular version that came with a limited edition 20th anniversary t-shirt , a boxed edition vhs in a hardcover case digitally re-mastered with the original theatrical widescreen presentation , in a nifty plastic picture decorated box with a numbered snow-globe  
in other words i am completely and utterly obsessed with the film  
it has changed horror movies forever and spawned six sequels with only 2 , 4 , and 7 being truly good  
it also spawned several cheap imitations of the film that were offensive in some ways to a true halloween fan  
since i heard about halloween being released on dvd in a limited edition of 30 , 000 copies , i knew i had to buy one no matter what ! 
i did and man to me it's the best dvd ever manufactured with the brilliance of the film "
1,"lean , mean , escapist thrillers are a tough product to come by  
most are unnecessarily complicated , and others have no sense of expediency -- the thrill-ride effect gets lost in the cumbersome plot  
perhaps the ultimate escapist thriller was the fugitive , which featured none of the flash-bang effects of today's market but rather a bread-and-butter , textbook example of what a clever script and good direction is all about  
the latest tony scott movie , enemy of the state , doesn't make it to that level  
it's a true nineties product that runs like greased lightning through a maze of cell phones and laptop computers , without looking back  
although director scott has made missteps in the past , such as the lame thriller the fan , he's generated a good deal of energy in pictures like crimson tide and top gun  
that vibrant spirit is present here , shown in well-timed and carefully planned chase scenes that give the movie an aura of sheer speed  
enemy of the state also features an unprecedented use of amazing cinematography -- director of photography daniel mindel throws a staggering amount of different views , angles , lenses , and film stocks at the audience that goes a long way toward involving the audience in the movie  
enemy is truly a visual experience , and that's only one of the reasons it's such a fun watch "
1,"andrew lloyd webber's musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time  
webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as "" oklahoma ! , "" or the slapstickness of shows like "" a funny thing happened on the way to the forum  "" 
they instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics  
like "" jesus christ superstar , "" which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune "" superstar , "" a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn't spread his message wider ) , "" evita "" takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things )  
 "" evita "" deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn't like di slept to "" the top "" )  
webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it  
here , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad  
it's also a musical , with almost no words not unsung  
the film plays like a rock opera , much like their "" jesus christ superstar , "" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one "
1,"one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy's wedding  
and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it  
her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn't made a worthwhile film since 1986  
but the fact is , betsy's wedding is also an alan alda film  
and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life  
written and directed by alda , betsy's wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor  
alda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare

the queen is pregnant but she has not liased with the king before , so fingers are pointed at sir roger de lodgerley played by charles hawtrey , who has a rather lecherous character to play this time  
the cardinal and cromwell decide to get a signed confession from sir roger by using all kinds of torture devices ! 
owing to circumstances , sir roger is sometimes needed to sign that he is the father and sometimes that he isn't  
this is because of renewed threats by the king of france ( peter gilmore ) to come over himself , which in the end he does

but weep not , dear readers , because the latest comedy out of the hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet  
austin powers : the spy who shagged me is one of the funniest things i've had the pleasure to see in a long time ; a completely looney , delightful parody of the often pretentious james bond flicks  
if all comedies ( or even half ; or - - what am i saying ? 
-- even a fifth of them ) could be this consistently hysterical , i would take up residence at my local multiplex  
even more to this movie's credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the 1997 sleeper/cult hit austin powers : international man of mystery

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
the teaser trailers for my best friend's wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i'd frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often  
it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend's wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms  roberts  
the heroine of my best friend's wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn't married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other  
both julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael's age , julianne realizes that he's mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day  
however , she finds herself even more distraught when michael's call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary

i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage , grousing to myself about its transparently planes , trains and automobiles plot machinations , and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement  
this was a mass market romantic comedy , after all , a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and , even in its best days , worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm  
then marc lawrence did something wonderful , something which made the entire film click into place : he showed me a comic love story about grown-ups  
it certainly didn't look that way from the outset , which introduces groom-to-be ben holmes ( ben affleck ) at his bachelor party , surrounded by friends and family whooping over his "" last night of freedom  "" 
ben loves his fiancee bridget ( maura tierney ) , but the doom-and-gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this 'till death do you part business

as transportation troubles thwart them at every turn , ben and sarah begin a three-day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger , ben seeing in sarah the chances he's never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability she's never had

1,"the uncompromising nudity bared throughout petrice chereau's intimacy has already garnered much notoriety , but it's in the naked faces of fearless actors mark rylance ( angels & insects ) and kerry fox ( welcome to sarajevo ) that the tender ache of emotional resonance is discovered  
with sharp , intelligent eyes that reflect experience and maturity , rylance and fox are refreshingly detached from the false glamour of hollywood idols  
their sex scenes together are bracing in their raw honesty , in the acceptance of flesh and messiness  
less apparent , but no less remarkable , are the astute observations of behavior revealed through those carnal beats of haste and hesitance , often without a single line of dialogue  
not aiming for the spiritual poetry of in the realm of the senses or the philosophical transgressions of crash , chereau keeps his sexual odyssey firmly grounded in terms of straightforward character development  
that may be the very reason why intimacy seems unerringly impressive but never particularly significant on more than a tactile , sensory level  
the themes of human isolation are barren and obvious , a science project devoid of any especially groundbreaking hypothesis  
intimacy does manage to stand out from lesser portraits of "" human interconnectedness "" and pinter-esque rummages through psychological dirty drawers ( okay , kill me )

jon voight plays leo f  drummond , the intimidating and arrogant leader of the all-powerful insurance company's team of lawyers who will do anything to oppose justice  
will rudy defeat leo ? 
will he enjoy being a lawyer ? 
opinion : the good news is that this movie has a happy ending , and it features a guy trying to do the right thing  
director francis ford coppola does this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie  
in the typical lawyer movie there's one big case and the movie focuses on solving it , and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives turn up before the good guy wins ( after lots of gripping courtroom drama )

by that point , it was evident that mr  bond was back with a vengeance  
all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience  
it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts

it's utopia , this tiny town tucked away in the timberland of northwestern montana , where old codgers lounge on the porch of the general store to pass the time away and the local matchmakers ( nan martin , louise fletcher ) eagerly pair off the young people , regardless of sexual preference  
there's nary a homophobe or bigot around , much to the surprise of henry hart ( arye gross ) , a successful but lonely manhattan artist who returns home to care for sam ( george coe ) , the ailing grandfather who raised him  
and with the simultaneous re-appearance of his best-friend from high-school and object of his unrequited love ( tim dekay ) , now divorced with two young sons , the fact of his homosexuality must be faced  
to complete the triangle , there's the tall , taciturn native american ( eric schweig ) who owns the general store and lovingly yet secretly prepares gourmet meals for henry and sam  
this fable about home and family is a major debut for first-time film-maker thomas bezucha ( a former designer for coach and polo/ralph lauren ) who is meticulous about minding details , using ballads like "" welcome to my world "" and "" achin' , breakin' heart "" to set up the concept of our universal longing to find a place in which we can love and be loved  
in the paradise of big eden , what you are doesn't matter as much as generosity of spirit , respect and kindness  
sure , the plot's implausible but it's a good-natured fantasy so allowances should be made  
and rob sweeney's photography of glacier national park is spectacular ! 
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" big eden "" is a charming , quirky , off-beat 7  
it's a heart-warming romantic comedy about a gay man who doesn't die of aids or wind up alone at the end "
1,"since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style  
now , instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow  
this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993's schindler's list shows  
most of today's mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience  
that's why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema  
the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950's company town of coalwood , west virginia  
it's a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine  
the mine , which is run by homer's father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however  
after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , "" anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did "

1,"while watching wes anderson's rushmore , it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer , the film's anti-hero , was not written with jason schwartzman in mind  
the young actor , making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman  
schwartzman plays max , a student who is more interested in his extra-curricular activities ( such as writing edgy plays like "" serpico "" and being president of the rushmore beekeepers ) but sees his grades suffer as a result  
on the brink of being thrown out , he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume ( the great bill murray ) to build an aquarium ( on rushmore's baseball field ) in her honour  
unfortunately for everyone involved , blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well , which gets in the way of max's plans to woo her  
max is one of the best-written characters we've yet seen in the 90s , and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age  
as everyone else has probably already pointed out , he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman ( although i was reminded more of paul from "" the wonder years "" , from a visual standpoint , at least )  
hopefully , if he avoids typecasting as weird , quirky loner-types he should earn himself a good career  
bill murray is his equal as blume , displaying a depth we haven't yet seen from him "
1,"in "" the sweet hereafter , "" writer/director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living  
he shows us how it isn't dying that hurts , but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death , and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings  
on a cold winter day in a small , isolated town in british columbia , a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake , where it cracks through the ice and sinks  
fourteen children die , and numerous others are hurt  
for the residents of this small town , all of whose children were on that bus , it is an earth-shattering event that resolutely alters their lives  
they have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain , but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle

the bus driver , dolores driscoll ( gabrielle rose ) , is a kindly woman who loved the children and , although she lives with a burden of guilt , is not held responsible for the accident

1,"the start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate  
people are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future  
after a sort of confusing bit involving fake-looking cyborg things , the movie jumps into the future and the movie improves by leaps and bounds  
the basic idea behind the movie is that every once in a while ( make that every 1000 years or so ) an evil force comes to destroy earth  
the things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element  
the plot in this movie really isn't that important to the thing though

for those of you not familiar with the premise , dr clayton forrester ( beaulieu ) wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public  
to achieve this , he ( in the words of the tv series' theme , which is missing in the movie ) "" bumped [mike nelson ( nelson ) ] on the noggin and then shot him into space "" , and is monitoring nelson's reactions to the movies he is forced to endure  
rather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies , nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions , tom servo and crow t  robot  
the format of the show consists of nelson , servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched , and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love , the ship on which our heroes are marooned  
only two things are different in the movie : the absence of forrester's sidekick , tv's frank , and the slower pace of the jokes

1,"this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in 1989  
whether it was the meddling of studio executives , or the work of writer/director james cameron himself , the original cut of this underwater sci-fi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed  
the main problem was fairly simple : the film's climax was unworthy of its build-up  
someone at 20th century fox - and no doubt cameron himself - must have agreed , because in 1993 came the theatrical release of the abyss : special edition  
now available on video , it seems timely to re-evaluate what , in its newly revamped state , is now a near-masterpiece despite its borrowings from films like 2010 : odyssey two , alien and close encounters of third kind

thanks to the business savvy of don king , an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman  
fans were treated to an 8 round battle of endurance and strategy , as much as brute strength , that immediately entered boxing lore  
with the benefit of the first-hand recollections of that old ex-pug norman mailer , this classic conflict is brought back to life  
but "" when we were kings "" tackles issues that are harder to pin down than the simple facts of a boxing match  
questions of political power and social justice appear throughout this documentary  
gast could hardly choose otherwise , considering the vocal , uncompromising politics of muhammad ali  
a member of the controversial black separatist movement the nation of islam , ali opens gast's film with a forceful swipe at the united states  
when ali hollers "" damn america' , the audience knows the imprecation is heartfelt ; the brutal yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind "
1,"one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable  
you know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is  
sure , it's been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch  
this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun  
one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story  
this rule applies highly to kiss the girls  
there is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made  
however , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through  
well , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up "
1,"usually when a blockbuster comes out , it's loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action  
mystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year

1,"with the abundance of trite , recycled movies in the late '90s , there is a tremendous demand by movie lovers ( never mind movie critics ) for movies that present the wide film audience with something truly original : perhaps audaciously , perhaps purely thematically  
for the former , you need look no further than director tom tykwer's incredible german thriller run lola run , a movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwards  
lola , a contemporary goth-girl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni one day  
it seems that because she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand marks , and if he doesn't deliver a hundred thousand marks within the next twenty minutes , he will be killed  
this gives lola twenty minutes to come up with 100 , 000 marks , or her boyfriend dies  
so she runs -- not just jogs , sprints -- in hopes that somehow , someway , she'll be able to obtain the money and save a life  
>from there , as critic steve rhodes described it , run lola run plays a bit like "" sliding doors on steroids

i've seen some of his films ( silkwood , backdraft , unlawful entry ) and while he gave adequate performances , i have never been impressed with his work

russell gives a fine performance , as do most of the cast , one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film  
to say that he holds the film together would not be completely true , but he does it no harm  
russell plays jeff , one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy ( kathleen quinlan ) cross country to san diego to start a new job and a new life

he is taken prisoner along with some other humans , and tries his best to escape his simian captors  
oh yeah , and did i mention that the apes can talk ? 
kewl ! 
critique : despite this film not looking like a "" tim burton movie "" or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself , i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun , summer fare  
although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make-up jobs and characterizations  
i mean , i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real ! 
i also have to "" give it up "" to all of the actors inside the costumes , not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make-up slobbered all over them for 2-4 hours , but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well  
i especially enjoyed bonham carter's performance , who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film ( human or ape ) and tim roth's bad guy , who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part  
plot-wise , i liked the beginning of the film , the whole build-up once wahlberg got into the village , the escape and most of the fight scenes , but once things got out into the deserted area ( and the final battle sequence ) , i kinda lost a bit of my interest  
i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of "" human beings as animals "" then i was about the end battle sequence , which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film

1,"ingredients : little orphan boy , rural grandparents , mountains , native american lore 
synopsis : in this loving film portrayal of an idyllic and pivotal time that a young boy spends with grandpa and grandma , the self recollections of an unseen narrator focus on his world view as a tennessee orphan boy learning of his heritage through his grandparents  
the setting is after the first world war , during the great depression years  
a nine-year-old orphan named little tree ( joseph ashton ) is taken in and taught the wondrous ways of the woods by his caucasian moonshiner grandpa ( james cromwell ) and his native american grandma ( tantoo cardinal ) in the wilderness of the mountains of tennessee  
here little tree learns an almost magical appreciation for nature and farm life - - and experiences beautiful and wondrous things such as the sunrise  
everything is miraculous to a child  
but it all comes crashing down for the boy when the u  s  government forcibly takes custody away from grandpa and grandma , and forces little tree to attend the notched gap boarding school , a kind of internment camp where multiracial cherokee kids are indoctrinated to dress , pray , speak , and think like white people or face solitary confinement and corporeal punishment  
through his childhood experiences , little tree learns lessons about love , race , life , death , people , nature , and folk wisdom "

and who better than billy crystal  
after appearing in bottom-of-the-barrel flops , father's day and my giant , crystal finally finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here  
playing vitti's private shrink , the two very different stars strike an unorthodox , but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish  
casting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an in-joke , i think  
placed in this mobster's shoes , deniro gets to spoof characters he himself played in films like the godfather , part ii and casino "
1,"if beavis and butthead had a favorite movie , from dusk till dawn would probably be it  
scripted by quentin tarantino and directed by robert rodriguez ( desperado ) , the movie panders to the very worst in sex and violence -- and is incredibly fun to watch  
it starts off as a pulp fiction-type crime story , with criminal brothers george clooney and tarantino robbing a convenience store  
because this is a tarantino movie , however , it's not just a case of pull the gun and take the loot , it's a case of a hole being shot through someone's hand , a man on fire jumping out behind the counter and the entire store blowing up as they drive away  
the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie -- everything overdone and nothing as it seems  
clooney and tarantino bring a hostage to the motel and then hijack an rv with a family in it  
harvey keitel plays the backslidden ex-preacher and juliette lewis his daughter , whom registered sex-pervert tarantino eyes endlessly  
you know you're mentally unbalanced when you find lewis the least bit attractive , although she's not nearly as obnoxious as usual in from dusk till dawn

i mean , it left me completely bored , unsatisfied , and generally kinda weirded out  
but then again , not every film's supposed to leave you entertained  
 "" crash "" is structured to play like a porn flick , but with significantly more plot and dialogue  
while we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex , we also have a skimpy little plot going on ( mostly towards the beginning ) , and maybe just a hair of characterization  
not to mention the acting is generally pretty good , and we don't really see a lot of the actors completely exposed  
but what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience  
this film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of "" henry and june "" or the just plain horniness of , say , "" deep throat "" ( not that i've seen it ) "

after a few disastrous "" mating "" attempts , he figures his best bet will be susan ( annette bening ) , a former alcoholic who eventually tells harold that she won't have sex again until she gets married  
the leader of harold's planet ( ben kingsley ) tells him to marry her , and harold is soon exposed to all the "" joys "" of married life  
despite its title and premise which seem to imply that this is some jerry lewis vehicle from the late 1960s , what planet are you from ? 
is a very funny movie  
the plot ( which the film wisely doesn't linger on the specifics of for too long ) is of course nothing more than framework for the jokes , most of which work very well  
the material may be considered crude and tasteless by many , and i might have thought so as well had shandling not been the lead  
but he brings a sort of pathetic charm to the role , and it's his performance that makes the film truly funny instead of just offensive  
plus if you think about it , what planet are you from ? 
could have very easily gone the gross-out route ( considering that shandling's character is given a detachable penis that vibrates and hums when he gets excited ) "
1,"showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven , director , and joe eszterhas , writer  
their last effort , basic instinct , played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry-spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone's taste , but certainly a well-crafted movie  
possibly that movie's greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage , prior to the movie , during the movie , and after the movie    
and that , after bringing all the plotlines together neatly , it left the viewer with full knowledge of what * would * happen in the characters' future , so there was no need to film it  
there was actually about four hours' worth of screen story there , but eszterhas found ways to get it all on-screen in two , by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on ; and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails  
the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls  
we have attractive , sympathetic , but still highly repellent characters ; we have shows for the eyes and the ears , plotlines that play on several levels , we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable , and we have a story of an innocent ( who may not be so innocent ) who's trying to play straight , trying to improve her station in life , who slips into behaving the way those around her do "
1,"it might surprise some to know that joel and ethan coen , who have brought such unabated lunacy to our movie screens as "" raising arizona "" and "" the hudsucker proxy , "" made their feature film debut with "" blood simple , "" a grim and often gruesome tale of revenge , murder , and literally fatal misconceptions in rural texas  
it bears some resemblance , story-wise , to the coens' recent "" fargo , "" but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here ; "" blood simple "" is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end  
the premise of "" blood simple "" is really just a slight variation on the standard love-triangle/revenge scheme : sleazy bar owner julian marty ( dan hedaya ) hires a shifty private detective ( m  
emmet walsh ) to kill his wife abby ( frances mcdormand ) and her illicit lover ray ( john getz )  
things start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery but , upon collecting the money , becomes uncertain as to whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme  
to reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much , but what ensues is a series of bloody ( and i do mean bloody ) confrontations , each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening  
every act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrator's eyes , but we , the audience , are made privy to the "" big picture "" and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person  
this aspect of the story , along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality - one gets the sense that if guns and , in one case , shovels , were not available , some of these characters would claw each other to death - are the most effective components of the film  
the coens might have done well to title the film "" fear and loathing in texas "

1," "" the tailor of panama "" is a different kind of spy movie  
despite the presence of pierce brosnan , there is nary a hint of james bond flash here  
instead of big action scenes , leering super villains and empty-headed femme fatales , we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation  
based on the novel by john le carr ? , who also co-wrote the screenplay , the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year : a solid , well-told story  
brosnan plays andy osnard , a british operative walking on thin ice  
his british superiors ship him off to panama , making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement  
osnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co-workers and his new home base  
when shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that , since the creation of the panama canal , the structure is the sole connection between north and south america , he barely keeps from yawning  
brosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007 , investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end "

from the master of the horror himself , wes craven , it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them , by making the teenagers do what they know they're not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them ( don't run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door , never say "" i'll be right back , "" etc  )  
when i first heard this description , i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie  
how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies  
was this wes craven's remedy from making "" real "" bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn ? 
it just seemed cheap to me  
then i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes , involving drew barrymore and a nail-bitingly intense phone conversation , completely changed my attitude  
scream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick , it's also a pretty scary movie  
if you've seen a million of these kinds of films , you know exactly what is going to happen "

1,"i can hear the question already  
what on earth do these two movies have in common ?

1,"it's tough to really say something nice about a type of person who's so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone , but by god , "" american history x "" does it , and for that , i commend it  
it not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo-nazi skinhead , a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who's not what they are , and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off  
the subject of this film is one of them , but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack  
he's the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in another brilliant stroke , justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks  
he's so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process  
his name is derek vinyard , and he's played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he's almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as , say , malcom x  when we first see him , he's clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast , a devlish goatee , and he's attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets , at least when he doesn't need them  
he so believes in his convictions that he's willing to put his beliefs to the test , even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison , if only for a couple years  
 "" american history x "" is about derek , how he became a neo-nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake "

1,"_in brief : _ this film needs no introduction  
if you haven't heard of it , then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical , and if you haven't seen it -- well , i suspect you're in a small minority ! 
first thing's first ? is it all it's hyped up to be ? 
well , yes ? and no  
it's a good film , and there's a lot to like about it , but it's not without its problems  
when i saw the first trailer for "" titanic "" , it was when i went to see "" bean "" last summer , i think , my intial reaction was -- ain't that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real-life tragedy ? ! 
i mean , what's happened to hollywood's script-writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ? 
gads , whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ? 
i was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i wasn't alone in that respect  
it's when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) and anyone who'd been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice ! 
i didn't see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) , 
so i went with a slightly more open mind , but i still didn't think i'd enjoy it much  
did i ? yes and no  
mainly yes , i'm happy to say  
the first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i'll talk about that later ? ) but because the re-created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron's directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the "" human "" aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting  
the film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a' course !

this is director tim burton's finest film to date  
many will compare this tale of martians who invade earth to independence day , but even though the stories are similar , they really are two distinctly different films  
however as a whole , mars attacks is much more entertaining than id4 , and i loved id4  
you really have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy this film  
it is completely wacked-out and unlike anything you've ever seen  
once the silly tone of the film is set , it's easy to just sit back and throw logic out the window because logic and comedy just don't mix  
the plot is simple : martians invade the earth "
1,"as any sociologist will attest , your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult  
parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives  
but if your upbringing is marred with violence , hate and dysfunctionality , then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome

1,"trekkies , roger nygard's energetic and hilarious documentary , brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions  
the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non-fans alike  
 ( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs  trekker polemic as not worth arguing about  ) 
the good-spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable , loud giggles , yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe  
denise crosby , who played tasha yar on "" star trek : the next generation , "" serves as the host  
in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary ( oed )  
 ( the oed cites a february , 1976 caption in the "" new yorker "" as the first recorded usage of the word  ) 
unless you've been to the conventions , i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans "
1," "" love is the devil "" is a challenging film , munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot , perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist's psyche rather than the artist's lifeline  
watching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter  
everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon , the film's subject , looked at it personally  
but while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what's going on  
exactly what was i looking at ? 
watching this film , i wasn't sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous  
directed ( and written ) by john maybury , "" love is the devil "" is stylish masterpiece for the senses  
everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing  
the camera angles are ferociously askew , and the close-ups are uncomfortably too close  
the editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon's world and psyche "
1,"while watching boiler room , i was constantly reminded of last year's masterpiece fight club  
both films consist of a predominately male cast  
both films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires  
and both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator , who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped  
while boiler room writer/director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club , he does contribute another impressive work to a series of films aiming to represent the new generation  
a generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be a millionaire  
paying homage to oliver stone's 1987 classic wall street , younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger , hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older , more experienced types  
as is true in real life , younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology  
boiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages "

redford may look great on-screen , but over the past few years , he's proven himself a bigger talent behind the camera

while the milagro beanfield war was only occasionally successful at combining magic-realism with    um ,

1,"vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element , substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject , but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents  
and , unlike any of the more outlandish myths , the vampire holds some real-world probability ( one study claims 1 , 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide , and places 50 in los angeles )  
but lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys , john carpenter would like to remind us that they are - and always have been - a truly frightening element of the thriller genre  
and remind us he does in his latest film , vampires  
there was some question , as halloween weekend approached , of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinema's immensely successful blade , released in august  
the two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue , and don't even agree on some basic points of the slaying method  
 ( for instance , blade's main weapons are silver and garlic , whereas main character jack crow's technique is a wooden stake to the heart  ) 
blade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization , while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate  
both have their advantages , and here , carpenter's style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered "
1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
on december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream  
although the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre  
the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes  
the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost  
scream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line's a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight  
and scream's rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion  
it's hard to understate this last point "
1,"the central focus of michael winterbottom's "" welcome to sarajevo "" is sarajevo itself , the city under siege , and its different effect on the characters unfortunate enough to be stuck there  
it proves the backdrop for a stunningly realized story which refreshingly strays from mythic portents ( "" platoon "" ) , racial tumultuosness ( the risible "" the walking dead "" ) or a tinge of schmaltziness ( "" schindler's list "" )  
the two leads , stephen dillane as a reporter and emira nusevic as an orphan with a plight few can identify with , are extremely believable ; not one moment with them involved rings false  
the question is not what went right  
the question is what went wrong  
for one , the film fails to provide a political overview of the war as it progresses ( the dillane characters reports an american plane departing from sarajevo as it departs , and that's about it  )  
the assortment of high-profile supporting actors , ranging from woody harrelson as a yankee reporter "" into "" liquor and cigarrettes to marisa tomei as a huggable children's aid or somesuch are incapable of rising above the sketchiness of their characters , albeit they strive  
the interrupted use of authentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest of the film , it makes the fictional characters seem powerless by comparison "
1,"the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats  
it's not a pretty death , and it's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea  
sometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other  
quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999's the matrix , can be a real gem  
but too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors  
flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists  
mostly it's laughable  
in hollywood's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form  
but iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right "
1,"warren beatty's "" bulworth "" is a caustic political comedy that doesn't attack any particular political group , but rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system  
some might think this film is vulgar , and in many ways it is  
however , as loud and raucous as it is , "" bulworth "" speaks the truth , which is almost always ugly to hear  
beatty , who directed the film and co-wrote the script with jeremy pikser ( "" the lemon sisters "" ) , stars as incumbent u  s  senator jay billington bulworth , who has one of the best politician names in cinema history  
bulworth is a democrat , and in beatty's view , he is symbolic of everything that has gone wrong with the current democratic party  
once an ideological liberal ( like beatty still is ) , bulworth has long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington  
instead of waging the battles for the impoverished and the downtrodden , which was once the calling card of democrats , bulworth has become another sell-out money hound - if he's not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese , he's making wind-bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement , "" america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium "

1,"if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue , we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia  
although some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way , like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle's high school reunion ) , some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones  
until that happens , 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed , when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel , materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters  
contemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times

wilhelm furtwangler , then the world's greatest orchestra conductor stayed in germany and cooperated with the nazis  
what were his views , was he a war criminal or a secret resistance fighter ? 
how much did he know about crimes against humanity ? 
the us government investigated him after the war and this film is a dramatization of that investigation  
 , high +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
in my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabo's sunshine , a film that covers the fortunes of a jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes , hungarian aristocrats , nazis , and communists  
szabo's follow-up film , a german production , is much more limited in scope  
it is about the post-war investigation of who criminally supported the nazis and who opposed them  
ronald harwood's screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of a great classical music conductor who stayed on in germany when the nazis took power and became the most popular conductor of the third reich

1,"in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance  
ever since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80's  
in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world  
you'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open

1,"the rich man's wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double , where the story and characters are so one-dimensional and contrived that you know you shouldn't be enjoying yourself  
but somehow , the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things  
not that it's bad , it's just that it's been done before ; and better , in my opinion  
i realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre , but it's probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now ; you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet , striving helplessly to get out , and instead of just flushing him , you end up kind of rooting for the little guy ?

two english fops , the 'powdered , be-wigged , be-ribboned' sir rodney ffing ( sidney james ) and his counterpart lord darcy pew ( jim dale ) decide to travel to revolutionary france in an attempt to rescue their fellow french royalists and aristocrats from losing their heads by the guillotine  
due to a series of machinations and disguises , they are largely successful  
ffing becomes known as 'the black fingernail' because he leaves a calling card behind which shows two fingers sticking up , one with a black fingernail  
after the fingernail rescues a prominent royalist the duc de pommfrit ( charles hawtrey ) , citizen robespierre ( peter gilmore ) orders the head of the secret police citizen 'the big cheese' camembert ( kenneth williams ) and citizen bidet ( peter butterworth ) to follow the fingernail to england and do away with him  
 ( in fact , darcy and ffing are their coachmen ! ) 
once at calais , the fingernail meets jacqueline ( dany robin ) and they fall in love instantly  
he tells her his identity and gives her his locket

1,"though it is a fine piece of filmmaking , there's something about elizabeth    that 
left me a bit cold , and i think it is something that bugs me quite often in films , particularly these days ; i just didn't care about the characters  
to me , the first and foremost job of a filmmaker is to create characters ( be they imagined or historical as the case may be ) that the audience gives a hoot about  
and though elizabeth works well on many levels , it falls short of excellence because of that very reason  
elizabeth takes place in england in 1554 , as queen mary , half sister of elizabeth and a monarch on the side of catholicism is dying  
before she dies , though , she cannot bear to sign a document which would condemn her half sister to death because of her heretical protestant beliefs  
as a result , amidst much anger within the council , elizabeth becomes the queen of england "

it has a lot working against it , for me at least

it does win you over , though , even if it is painfully predictable  
just think about it : two single parents , with their cute kids , are thrown together due to a missed field trip  
through a day of near disasters , they cont inually meet , get in one another's way , cause trouble for one another , and generally insult one another at every opportunity

it is not an easy situation , but a perfectly plausible one , the panorama in which breakdown musters it's throbbing suspense and skillfully executed tautness

full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture

 "" hard copy "" 's diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman's fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for

 ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband  ) 
smart's got a point  
it wouldn't be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version

milos forman's first film since the ill-fated valmont , columbia's the people vs  
larry flynt , is a vastly entertaining ( if not particularly enlightening ) biopic of hustler publisher and self-made millionaire larry flynt , who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s  
the film unweaves its tale in a chronological order : we open with young and dirt-poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy , peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky  
cut to forward in time , where the two flynt brothers , now young men , are running the struggling hustler go-go clubs in cincinnati  
the strip clubs are in a dire financial state , and in a last-ditch effort to salvage the operations , flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter  
this evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine , creating larry flynt a vast financial empire , and the rest is history  
what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material , and who railed and preached against him - flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt - and his driven , single-minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression , regardless of personal cost "

it's more of a ho-hum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language  
luckily , his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen , and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer  
the story introduces us to a street-wise black woman named jackie brown ( pam grier ) , a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another  
she works for a bottom-of-the-barrel airline and receives a minimal salary  
but one day , she is picked up by a pair of federal officials ( including michael keaton as the tough-nosed ray nicolet ) , and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of smuggled dope

soon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 through to them under nicolet's nose , with the help of ordell's oaf of a partner ( robert de niro ) and drugged-out lady friend ( bridget fonda ) "

mother-in-law jokes prevail  
furthermore , the trouble that joe and norma baxter ( ian lavender and adrienne posta ) have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families

however , they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls , sandra ( carol hawkins ) and carol ( sherrie hewson )

he replies something like : "" the church is flooded but at least the floodwaters put out the big fire  
well , the fire wasn't that bad , since , while the church was burning , looters apparently thought it was safe enough to break through all the priceless stained glass windows  ""

suddenly his security truck carrying over three million dollars gets stuck on the flooded street and is waylaid by armed looters  
tom has no choice but to grab the bag full of money , hide it , and swim for his life

simple : the characters  
they're not your typical stupid horror film victims who don't know what the hell to do when being chased by a guy in a ski mask and a machette

1,"by phil curtolo mel gibson ( braveheart ) gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard's ransom  
gibson plays tom mullen , a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath , played by gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million  
tom and his wife , kate , played by rene russo ( tin cup ) were instructed not to inform the police , but they contacted the fbi  
minutes later , an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in tom's house and wiring every phone  
the plot sounds average , just like most other kidnap movies that you've already seen , and it was nothing more than that  
that is until about half-way through the movie  
suddenly , tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying , "" this is your ransom  
but this is as close as you will ever get to it  
instead , i am offering this money as a reward on your head , dead or alive "
1,"it's ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director's cut of the film  
films such as aliens , the abyss , the wild bunch , blade runner , and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker's integrity , later chopped up or mucked with by the studio  
the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films  
the dvd release of the original international version of luc besson's 1995 masterpiece the professional , which is known as l ? on around the world , is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a director's cut  
for years , i have heard of an "" international "" version available only in laserdisc format , which has eluded me for years  
i even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors' cuts - including l ? on  
but after countless searches in laserdisc stores , i could never find it  
until now  
the film follows the story of l ? on , played by jean reno , a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello "
1,"usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock  
others will mention meg ryan

janeane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy , she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now

1,"billed as a "" feminist sex fantasy "" , this spirited , imaginative and thoroughly engaging film by the award-winning canadian director cynthia roberts , is destined for extreme reactions  
camille paglia enthusiasts will no doubt champion this heart-felt tale of the title character bubbles galore ( nina hartley ) , a porn-actress-turned-porn-producer who faces an uphill battle in her quest for sexual and economic independence  
however , those in the andrea dworkin camp , will no doubt loathe the film's decidedly pro-porn stance  
political considerations aside , however , this is a delightful lesbian love story as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour of bubbles' romantic entanglements with a naive and virginal young porn starlet dory drawers ( shauny sexton )  
in the backdrop , however is bubbles' loyal assistant vivian klitorsky ( tracy wright ) who pines longingly for the affections of her bubbly boss  
this femme-butch-femme triangle is what provides the film with considerable humanity * and * sensuality  
in addition to the romantic aspects of the story , bubbles is being stalked and terrorized by her ex-boyfriend godfrey montana ( daniel macivor ) , a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable as he can possibly make it  
when his plans to sabotage her latest film fall through , he snaps and psychotically decides to kill her

1,"capsule : earthy , experimental , difficult , shockingly frank ( even for 1997 ! ) , and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops  
the first few minutes of sweet sweetback's baad asssss song ( yes , i checked -- that's the correct number of ss ) are without dialogue , just eerie montages of sounds  
a young boy , obviously malnourished , is taken in and fed up by several loving mother-surrogate figures  
then one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation ( underneath the title credits ) that's far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts -- probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life , something we're not used to seeing on screen  
this is one tough movie to swallow , no matter who you are , but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately  
 ( i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences  ) 
the plot is simple but not simpleminded  
sweetback , hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man , breaks his bonds and runs like hell  
along the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies -- or at all , for that matter : the slums , the missions , the ghetto "

indeed  
while perhaps less dangerous than tequila shooters or bungee-jumping , they require no less amount of physical stamina and concentration  
i felt rewarded at the end of henry fool ; this movie creeps up on you-at a slow 139 minutes , i mean creeps-and despite the final shot's ambiguity , i left completely satisfied  
henry fool ( "" used to have an ? e' "" ) arrives at garbageman simon grim's house , claims the vacant basement apartment , and almost instantly inspires simon ( urbaniak ) to take up writing-henry ( martin donovan look-alike ryan ) is an ex-convict , a once-great author who has been "" exiled and marginalized "" by the publishing community because of his criminal activity  
simon's poetry turns him into a local sensation , as it causes mute women to sing , high-school girls to swoon , and councilmen to rile against its "" pornographic "" content

these story elements result in climaxes both inevitable and unpredictable ; the teacher-student relationship formed between henry and simon eventually reverses itself

star wars episode i : the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim 
never having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world ( i was more into star trek : the next generation ) , it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surrounding the latest installment , the phantom menace

endless toys lining the shelves , endless news reports , and a multi-billion dollar advertising campaign makes it all the more difficult

1,"the thirteenth floor , the third in what i would call "" the reality check movie series "" , is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year , the matrix and existenz  
all three made you think , made you wonder what is real , what isn't , and if our world is just a huge game  
the thirteenth floor doesn't reach the level of originality , creativity , and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz , but it certainly gives a great shot at it  
in the matrix , we were told that the humans are simply a virus

in the thirteenth floor , we learn that we are just electronic devices , living under another world of electronic devices

1,"the verdict : spine-chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king , featuring an outstanding , oscar-winning performance from kathy bates  
geez , french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this ! 
sorry , non-british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders - my apologies  
the pair are british comediennes ( jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in "" absolutely fabulous "" ) , who did a series of film spoofs a few years back , including alien , the exorcist and misery  
needless to say , amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates ( the resemblance was quite uncanny ! ) , dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder's legs ! 
but despite the lingering memory of their sketch , and although i've now seen the film a couple of times now , that "" hobbling "" scene was no less disturbing ! 
i'm still left screaming at the telly in revulsion ! 
that may be the most memorable scene , but it's certainly not the only worth watching  
stephen king , whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality , strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale  
it's a nicely crafted psychological horror , which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon ( james caan )  
rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes ( bates ) , who introduces herself as the writer's "" number one fan "" , he soon becomes her prisoner  
both the script and kathy bates' beautifully masterful performance ( for which she won an oscar ) work arm-in-arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit-cake ( or is that fruity as a nut-cake ? )  
bates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece "

receiving a summer grant to study "" chemo-electric therapy , "" geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together , as their three-year marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her  
he has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab , which is off limits to her , as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice , convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses  
his main argument is , that this is what the public wants , they don't want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments , they just want the benefits of science  
that he is depicted as a monster creating another monster , much like frankenstein was created , is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science ( science as a business ) as opposed to the good science ( science that cares about the small farmer ) , which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman , alex vine ( david ) , a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field , trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming  
he is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially , as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming , methods that have just come about in the last thirty- years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins  
the third view in all this is the artist's , represented by lillian , who points out that the artist's work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly , "" why shouldn't the same be true of the scientist ? "" 
she argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public , questioning what is good or evil in society , something that bad science has completely ignored "

but darn it , `music of the heart' is just layered with feel-good material and bright characterizations

yes , meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari , and that brings both good news and bad

the story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal , but does not pretend to be 100% factual  
plot : naval officer ramirez ( quinn ) gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal , in order to put an end to the actual militant's radical activities  
he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee  
ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this "" assignment "" , and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism , intrigue and double-personality syndrome ( which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states  ) 
critique : great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to two-hour runtime  
admittedly , i wasn't a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film , and didn't expect much from this movie beforehand , but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments , as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line  
the first hour is mostly just a build-up of things to come , and does offer a great characterization of the jackal , but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending  
quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal , but didn't offer anything extraordinary , in my opinion "

it's full of terrible acting , pointless violence , and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release

admitedly , comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums , often viewed as juvenile by most standards , even seen as illiterate by some  
judging by a series of poorly recieved ( financial and critical ) comic book based films ( such as batman and robin , steel , barb wire , the crow : city of angels , and the list goes on ) , one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film  
to some degree , i agree with this sentiment "

a bit hard to swallow ? 
that's only the first of many improbabilities in this film  
hauer stars as a man obsessed with keeping the birds on his island safe , while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector  
turner is the woman caught between the two men  
 "" a breed apart "" isn't a bad movie , exactly  
indeed , i found myself rooting for both the hauer and boothe characters , even though their goals couldn't be more different  
the problem with the film is that there are just too many inconsistencies  
for example , early on in the film , hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at "" his "" birds  
later on , the rednecks come back for revenge with four other people , and hauer kills a few of them "
1,"labelling is sometimes everything  
in original mad max , the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future , thus making it one of the science fiction classics , despite the future world being almost exactly like our own  
walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors  
producers weren't thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones  
on the other hand , producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america  
to make the movie even more distant from future , plot was loosely based on anabasis , historical book written by xenophon , greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago  
instead of ancient persia , movie begins in contemporary coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warriors , local youth gang , gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city  
the gathering , organised by gramercy park riffs , most powerful gang in the city , is taking place in bronx

as a friend of mine , who's a true titanic-buff , said "" if someone doesn't like this film , it's because they didn't want to  ""

like the marginal , motley bunch of post-apocalyptic youths director danny boyle tries to depict , trainspotting veers on the edge of utter mayhem but ultimately retains its footing and control  
the result : a movie that is a delightful example of how the medium is the message  
the message : a bunch of losers with loser names , mark renton ( ewan mcgregor ) , spud ( ewan bremner ) , sick boy ( jonny lee miller ) , tommy ( kevin mckidd ) , and begbie ( robert carlyle )

you can find these characters as they are , foul-mouthed , dirty , pathetic , ugly perhaps but definitely interesting , in irvin welsh's cult novel of the same name

starring ashley judd , tommy lee jones , bruce greenwood  
rated r  
double jeopardy is a lurid , prepostrous thriller that's also one of the year's most enjoyable  
it's an uncompromisingly brutal , cheerfully anarchic , hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it  
there is not a moment here when the events on screen don't have a direct bearing on the plot ; once the film gets going it never stops  
it has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and that's probably a correct assessment of the plot , but the film itself has little in common with the 1993 andrew davis/harrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones  
not even bothering with character introduction , director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the get-go and never finds the brake

okay , there's the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie  
disney's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship  
father , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson

against the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own  
tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild

the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn't have a winning side and a losing side

the opening segment is something of a foretaste of this film  
there's a guy's voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like , and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men and women  
as his imagination plays o n , he ( and we ) picture these motley characters in a mix-and-match shuffle of unlikely marriages , businesswomen with bums , matrons with paint salesmen , the images coming on in a faster and faster frenzy  
it's not just a witty , funny summing up of the film 's themes - you might not guess it yet , but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on  
what starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction , gets taken on a road trip , put through a detour or two and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash  
that may not sound so different from the average family sitcom , and the general idea of the film doesn't , at first , seem so wildly distant from standard-issue hollywood comedy : man who was adopted as a child ( ben still er ) sets out on a journey to meet his real parents , along with his wife ( patricia arquette ) , his baby , and a pretty psychology-researcher ( tea leoni ) in tow

1,"the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages  
martin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime  
unfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies  
seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime  
this film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s  
goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film )  
the book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york  
at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands

1,"director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one )  
film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story , but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something  
but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story  
so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential , the film almost automatically deserves a good review  
and when they add a fascinating story to it , you have nearly perfect entertainment  
fincher's the game is no exception to this  
the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time

1,"a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal  
a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another  
a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain  
a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end  
if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues  
it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label

1,"some movies have such an impact that they linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled , making you think carefully and recollect on what you have just seen  
i finished mike figgis' "" leaving las vegas "" hours ago , and it is still as haunting as when i hit rewind on the vcr  
alot of people refer to this film as "" that flick where nick cage plays that alcoholic dude ""  
 "" leaving las vegas "" is not so much a movie about alcoholism as it is a story about two people who except each other for what they are : a drunk and a whore  
ben ( nicolas cage in possibly the best male performance of the past twenty years ) is the drunk  
his family and friends have long since abandon him , and all he has left is his liquor  
in a scene early in the film , we see ben staggering into a resteraunt , looking for a "" friend "" of his to mooch some money off of

1,"i guess it's a credit to jackie chan and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour 2 could not be ruined even by the nauseating "" comedy "" of chris tucker  
i'm a fan of jackie chan in just about any medium , and this movie lets him not only do his impressive-as-ever martial arts schtick , but show off his comic timing as well  
it would have worked better if he was the only name above the title  
the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts and special effects  
this time around , the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan ( john lone ) , who makes his fortune by shipping counterfeit money into the united states ( i'm still not sure how you can make a fortune doing that : is there a place where one can exchange fake bills for real ones ? )  
the only way to tell the phony money from the genuine article is to set it on fire and see what color it burns  
of course , it's up to hong kong detective lee ( chan ) and trash-talking lapd detective james carter ( tucker ) to take the bad guys out and the authorities , to the extent that they even exist , stay out of their way  
rush hour 2 turns the tables on the first film in that here it's carter who gets the two of them into trouble and lee who winds up having to get them out  
i guarantee that my rating would have been at least a half of a grade higher had anyone other than chris tucker been cast as the foil for jackie chan "

the only thing missing is charlton heston  
instead , we get val kilmer voicing moses , an hebrew who is placed in a river by his mother and rescued by the queen of egypt ( helen mirren  )

1,"to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie , mulan is a whole new world  
the mouse factory's latest feature is a treasure , featuring magnificent animation , a strong story and finely drawn characters  
mulan is the story of a fiesty , head-strong young woman who , unlike other disney heroines , isn't seeking her prince charming , 
mulan's motivations are simple ; to save her father , serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say  
the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation  
the emperor has called for a conscription , one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation  
mulan's crippled father is called , but mulan sneaks off , steals his armor and takes his place  
mulan is a saga of courage and self-discovery  
yet , despite the grim backdrop of war , it is a lively tale of self-reliance and brain-over-brawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy  
the movie utilizes a strong corps of asian-american talent as the voices for the main characters , including the wonderful ming-na wen ( the joy luck club ) as mulan , b "

but , after watching the movie , i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is  
 "" jude "" is a satirical film from start to finish about society's way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system , but what's remarkable is how timeless this film is  
the film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasn't really sure ) , but its story could even be retold today in modern form , although it'd be kinda different ( a given )  
it tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from "" shallow grave "" ) - a simple , dim-witted young man with big dreams  
in its bleak , foreboding opening , shot in grainy black and white , he gets a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham ) , his teacher : as they stand upon a mountain , looking upon a city in the distance , he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world

the opening and closing shots are a wonderful contrast to the rest of the gloomy , disturbing film  
they show not to make assumptions from first glance and that oddness is common in all places under all circumstances  
odd would be a perfect adjective to describe this film , its characters , its direction , and its story  
thankfully , the obscurity that "" blue velvet "" relies on is enough to make this film enjoyable  
since its elements are so originally weird , you never know what will happen next  
this is the main goal of a movie ; to be spontaneous and surprising

1,"there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review , not because of their own complexity , but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original  
one of such masterpieces is casablanca , probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art , but definitely the most popular one  
its popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere , but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day  
casablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience  
one of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail , at least judging by conventional movie-making wisdom of its time  
it was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn't been produced on stage ; screenplay by three writers - julius g  epstein , philip j  epstein and howard koch - was beeing written as shooting went along ; the main actors were producers' second choice , and , finally , man behind camera , michael curtiz was considered to be capable , but not great director

1,"expectation rating : a bit worse than expected ( mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull )  
roger ebert gave it a four star review , and while he is a critic that uses the full scale , and i often agree -- such as dark city being the best film of 1998 , he must have seen a better film  
i read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it  
the opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter  
the landscape is snowy and cold , and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner ( which also reminds me of fargo ( which i loathed ) )  
one can almost sense the cold  
but the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead , instead raimi has made a more constrained film -- which probably is for the better  
this is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots

and that's a shame - this is a funny , enchanting , and goofy movie full of laughs , surprises , and wonderful dance sequences  
the surprising thing about "" shall we dance "" is the universal appeal of the story  
a us version is in the works , and it's no wonder - it's not really all that culture specific  
although there is a narrated set-up that adds some extra resonance to the proceedings ( about the view the japanese culture has about ballroom dancing ) , the movie is so rich in character and appeal that this added layer isn't at all necessary to understand or enjoy the film  
the only important unexplained japanese-specific reference that may leave some a bit puzzled is that 1000 yen is roughly $10 ( when you see the film - and you should see this film - you'll know why )

inheriting the mantle from last year's "" winner , "" matthew mcconaughey , is matt damon , and , like mcconaughey , he proves to be more than just a fresh young face , as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release--john grisham's the rainmaker and good will hunting  
damon has his first major starring role , a la mcconaughey , in a john grisham adaptation--in this case , francis ford coppola's take on the rainmaker  
damon plays wet-behind-the-ears attorney rudy baylor , who , immediately after passing the bar exam , finds himself representing the mother ( mary kay place ) of a terminally ill young man ( john whitworth ) in a big-league suit against a negligent insurance company  
while rudy's ( and the film's ) main concern is this case , he also finds time to protect a young wife ( claire danes ) from her abusive husband ( melrose placer andrew shue , in a mercifully brief role )  
written for the screen and directed by coppola , the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously  
coppola's most notable--and effective--contribution to the tried-and-true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself , which largely comes in the presence of danny devito ( as rudy's unlicensed co-counsel ) and golden globe nominee jon voight ( as the insurance company's hotshot attorney )  
the inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous , but danes is as superb as always  
then , of course , there is damon , who nicely juggles the weighty ( the insurance case , the spousal abuse ) and the humorous ( rudy's often comical naivete ) requirements of his role without missing a beat "

jackson pollock's "" making love "" quote is famous , but in practically the same breath , he said a more constructive thing , "" it's like looking at a bed of flowers--tear your hair out over what it means  "" 
it took him sixteen words to do as whole dissertations have tried and failed : equate god and abstract art and offer a kind of backhanded comfort to those confused to the point of resentment by the concept  
the biopic _pollock_ , actor ed harris' directorial debut , reflects the second soundbite in how it accepts pollock's creations as part of the order of things , and should similarly disarm haters of fine art  
arguably more than any other living actor , harris , who also plays _pollock_ , embodies the archetypal working stiff , and his blue-collar demystification of pollock's labour-intensive art , both as performer and director , makes for unpretentious cinema  
 ( from what i know of harris , he , like pollock , was not born gifted or lucky ; instead , a strong work ethic is the seed of his success  ) 
granted , it's possible that _pollock_ will alienate those same viewers perplexed by the imponderable "" purpose "" of pollock's splatter series : the common thread between them is a lack of editorializing  
the movie _pollock_ is all purposeful gazes and silent exchanges dotted by tantrums , but the motivations are left to our own perceptions "

into my bewildered visage  
it's almost always a surprise  
it sure as niflheim was this time  
amazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale , of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason  
and , in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film , it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale , where we roll our eyes occasionally , smirk to ourselves , and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes and a "" boy , i wish that could happen "" sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash  
another e  t  
another short circuit  
this film floored me , for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept , the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough , and presents itself well enough , to make it more of an american folk tale , with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time "
1,"as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it , the more pleased i was when i left  
first , getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz : "" if you liked scream , you'll love wild things ! "" 
 "" campbell gives a stunning performance ! "" 
 "" this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days ! "" 
 ( oh yeah , the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me ) 
now , onto more serious stuff ( and with this film , i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way )  
wild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa  
i'm not saying that in a bad way , but when you see this film , you may be shocked by what you see  
however , perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film's charming cast and tricky plot , that they let the film slide with an r rating  
being mormon , i'm bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film  
trouble is , i have already seen it  
and i like it ! 
wild things is a film noir of the 90s , filled with 40s sensibilities , and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture  
the style in which it is filmed is rich in color "
1," "" jaws "" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen  
the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds  
then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score  
dah-dum  
from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly  
right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once "" jaws "" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip  
perhaps what is most outstanding about "" jaws "" is how spielberg builds the movie  
he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act  
unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act "

the popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring

laughs and agatha christie-intense mystery , then yes , this movie would be a disappointment  
however , if you're just looking for an enjoyable movie and a good time , this is one to see

1,"when quentin tarantino made "" pulp fiction "" , he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s ; he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time  
but before you send me hate-mail for not giving that title to "" citizen kane "" , hear me out  
much like "" citizen kane "" , "" pulp fiction "" has changed movie making forever  
but i think the latter has had a tad more impact

1,"since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they're portraying , it's fitting to say that "" beloved "" come as a real shock as a film  
it's confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i've seen all year , and that's not necessarily because of the three-hour running time  
 "" beloved "" is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , "" beloved "" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based )  
 "" beloved "" tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children  
when the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family  
sethe is proud , though , and will not move  
her sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation  
a couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging

1,"books could be , and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy , and rightfully so  
this is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70s/early 80s , inspiring literally dozens of clones , from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day , and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre  
the special effects were groundbreaking , revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later  
literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it  
and now , george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy  
much has been and is still being made of the fact that mr  lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now  
some fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection , while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday's star wars updated with today's special effects wizardry  
either way , the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen , where it rightfully deserves to be seen "

1," "" the fugitive "" is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made  
it takes realistic , believable characters and tells an exciting story that's totally believable throughout

harrison ford stars as dr  richard kimble , a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife  
the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder , but is not told in a straightforward manner  
we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble's perspective

1,"robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible , god-given gifts , but are able to act like ordinary people  
in "" the natural "" ( 1984 ) , he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs , the baseball player who was destined to be "" the best there ever was , "" but still acted like a humble farm boy  
in "" butch cassidy and the sundance kid "" ( 1969 ) , he was the most dangerous shot in the west , yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good-looking charmer  
even in "" indecent proposal "" ( 1993 ) , where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love , redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency , especially when reciting a tale of lost love  
in his latest film , "" the horse whisperer , "" based on the best-selling novel by nicholas evans , redford again plays such a character  
redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie - i suppose the character of tom booker , a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses , was just too good to pass up  
despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses ( a magazine article coins the phrase "" horse whisperer "" to describe his uncanny talent ) , booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life  
booker's talents are taxed into service by annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) , a new york magazine editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , was recently in a horrible accident

peter fonda gives his undoubtedly best performance in victor nu ? ez's new film and patricia richardson ( home improvement star ) shows she is worthy of big screen attention

1,"wyatt earp has a lot to tell and little to say  
this story of the legendary lawman runs three hours and nine minutes and that's too long for this epic-wannabe that plays more like a tv mini-series than a movie  
the story opens on the earp family farm , with young wyatt ready to run away from home  
he wants to fight in the civil war , but his dad ( hackman ) has different ideas and wants his son to study law  
time passes and wyatt heads west , returns home to marry , and , after a spell , begins his career in law enforcement  
by the time he ( costner ) and his brothers ( madsen , david andrews , and linden ashby ) arrive in tombstone , wyatt has tried his hand at everything from hunting buffalo to dealing cards  
wyatt earp is very appealing in places-- such as cast , costumes , and cinematography-- but an overstated story and overpowered score deaden most of the emotional impact  
who can be moved by scene after scene after scene of swelling strings and suffocating speeches ? 
somber is fine-- just ask clint eastwood-- but this film that boasts not one , not two , but three , count 'em three , hammy death scenes ! 
still , a little bit of earp goes a long way and the life and times of the legendary lawman are from uninteresting stuff  
his , uh , unusual relations with women , for example , are an intriguing contrast to his character's credo of "" nothing counts as much as blood "

1,"no filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan  
i'm referring , specifically , to the narrative form  
in the sweet hereafter , egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his exotica or the adjuster  
said story , of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent , british columbia , that shatters the morale of the locals , is told in a most unstraightforward manner  
when the film opens , the accident has already happened , and stephens ( the wonderful holm ) , a polite ambulance-chaser , has arrived with the promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth of what really occurred that fateful morning  
throughout , we get to meet the parents of the dead , broken souls who follow stephens like "" the pied piper "" ( passages of which are read during the film )  
but there is one living passenger , the paralyzed nicole ( polley ) , whose dark secrets of a life before the accident may affect her decision to testify

1,"there was a lot riding on this movie  
everyone even moderately interested in the "" scream "" series was dying to know how it would end  
what would be the "" final act "" ? 
this is the end of an era for them , a movie which has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet , talking and tossing around rumors with their equally enthused buddies , and , for kids under 17 , those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into "" scream "" while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older than themselves  
no need to worry ; "" scream 3 "" is endlessly inventive and entertaining , a fine epilogue to the series that made kevin williamson a household name , reinvented the horror genre , and continued in the self-referential , post-modern tradition of quentin and co  
so , how does the story go ? 
as opposed to what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe , sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , now all-grown-up and constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her psyche , is not living in hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress , but rather in upstate california , living , understandably , alone in the confines of fences and vast security systems  
she works at home as a crisis center affiliate over the phone

a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking  
the film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop  
as boogie nights opens , he's toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity

1,"after having heard so many critics describe "" return to me "" as an old-fashioned hollywood romance , i kept asking myself going into this movie : what exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ? 
what made "" return to me "" old-fashioned and old-hollywood ? 
was it the tunes from sinatra , etc  , legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ? 
was it the glamorous , sophisticated feel ? 
the charisma of the two leads ? 
even now i can't say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer , because i haven't see that many old-fashioned hollywood romances  
i don't think any of the romances i've seen have been classified as such  
which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- "" return to me "" was old-fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic , the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider  
it was traditional , magical  
we knew it couldn't be too daring , or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in  
it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity , tenderness , and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that it couldn't help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings

1," "" living out loud , "" is the type of motion picture we don't often see : it is a film about mature , intelligent adults , instead of the usual american film , in which children basically dress up in grown-up clothing and parade around acting like immature seven-year-olds  
judith ( holly hunter ) , a fortysomething living in new york city , has been having a difficult time with life lately  
she is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband ( martin donovan ) , who had been cheating on her  
she cannot sleep , haunted by terrible memories , often imagines off-the-wall things to try and make the world seem like a better place , and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers , liz bailey ( queen latifah ) , perform at a local club  
judith's life does start to brighten a little when , one night when she gets home to her apartment late , strikes up a conversation with the elevator operator , pat ( danny devito ) , a lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently  
both of them create a sort of emotional connection with each other , seeking comfort with the other person , but while pat starts to form a deep love for her , judith only wants to remain friends  
 "" living out loud , "" which was written by richard lagravenese ( "" the bridges of madison county "" ) , who is also making his directing debut here , is a wonderful film from beginning to end , one that is honest , genuinely funny , and poignant  
the three central characters , that of judith , pat , and liz , are all written to be free-thinking , complex human beings , and are all likable , but flawed , people who are constantly interesting , as is the film itself

1,"it stands as a moment one will not soon forget : a giant , green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale , narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds  
this leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek , dreamworks' second computer animated feature , but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema , a page of this tale serves as that ogre's toilet paper  
from this opening moment , one can infer shrek's defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard , disney-esque fairy tale  
although rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek , the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship , courage , and acceptance , excelled by outstanding direction , stunning actor voice work , and most importantly , a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye  
while shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults , positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline : shrek , the previously mentioned ogre , holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community  
the jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider , known only as the donkey ( his species ) who talks , and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time , shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world  
the pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad , learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way  
their friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on , exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone  
shrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey "

1,"a big surprise to me  
the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off , but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope  
they replaced him just fine

the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant , who's ten  
this was another of my fears for the film , but he's a really good dancer , and plays a mean harmonica ( although he may have been dubbed )  
things that intellectually had bothered me before , like no mission from god , everyone being richer , it not being filmed in chicago -- gave me no problems at all  
i'm quite pleased that there were less car pile-ups , because they meant less music , and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing

1,"here's a word analogy : amistad is to the lost world as schindler's list is to jurassic park  
in 1993 , after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit , many critics described schindler's list as the director's "" penance "" ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster )  
now , after a three-year layoff , spielberg is back with a vengeance

1,"seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented )  
one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise  
with some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie  
there's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there  
the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict  
the premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist  
we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely  
later he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right  
the fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling "

woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit "" toy story , "" and things have changed a bit since the last one ended

in his absence , he has assigned buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , now comfortable in his role as a toy , to take charge

1,"jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway  
in as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive-compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you-know-where  
he's mean  
i mean really mean  
the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium  
every day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress  
you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe  
one day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks  
at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too "
1,"with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the "" film noir "" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller's crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy )  
their latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film  
the main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn't quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who's wise to the world , but he doesn't really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax  
that main character is jeffrey "" the dude "" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film's rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as "" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county  "" 
the dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline-psychotic who's in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody's cheating in a bowling match ( "" has the whole world gone crazy ? ! "" he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who's always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( "" donny , you have no frame of reference here ! "" )  
these three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of "" hotel california "" and , if it's possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter  
if that doesn't give you a good idea of this film's absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude's rug  
they've mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the "" big "" lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara )  
the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn't have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom "
1,"in arguably the most anticipated movie this century , george lucas has achieved a very mixed reaction to a sure blockbuster  
despite the fact the script and plot is a bit of a let down , the entire movie on the whole can be considered a milestone in technical excellence , in the sound and special effects department  
in terms of characters , by far the most outstanding and interesting is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , whose mature performance far exceeds her tender 14 years of age  
she is one ? hot' babe who defines true ? woman leadership'  
she not only has a presence , but knows how to take command of the situation and save her planet from ruination  
no thanks to the jedi knights who although led by the force , lack leadership qualities in terms of thinking up a plan to do anything  
the young obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) who has a bad hair day in every scene , gets to kill a bad guy in the end , but lacks a love interest to make him a desirable sort of hero  
in fact all the jedi knight are a bit asexual - there must be something about the force which makes them all hermits and loners

1," "" good will hunting "" is two movies in one : an independent take on the struggle of four boston pals and a traditional hollywood , "" prodigy child "" film complete with upbeats , downfalls , sporadically moving situations and plenty , plenty of shtick  
unusually directed by gus van sant , "" good will hunting "" overcomes the banalities of its story by affirming the emergence of fresh , new talent  
the film stars matt damon as will hunting as a mathematical , rebellious whiz kid inadvertly discovered by a college professor ( stellan skarsgard ) , who places him under psychological supervision with robin williams  
in a nutshell , that's it  
the core of the "" good will hunting "" is damon , who infuses the script ( co- written by "" chasing amy's "" ben affleck ) with just the right amount of warmth , sensitivity and humanity to accentuate his position as a refreshing multi- talented performer  
but it's the acting that hits the mark , and damon hits all the right notes , flying over robin williams' deja-vu role ( "" awakenings "" was written all over this ) as a devastated shrink who has closed all contact with society due to his wife's tragic death  
damon effortlessly blends the carelesness of a gregarious , confused thug with the absorbing ingeniousness of someone like einstein  
his rich , complex character is the pulp of "" good will hunting  "" 
everything else pales in comparison "

that is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward , with a comatose sunny von bulow  
she is the main narrator of the film , in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder  
the dramatic trick works , as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder , sex , unhappiness , and a lawyer's moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win  
jeremy irons is claus von bulow , in what is his finest role , and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history

1,"it's no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office  
a poorly-written script can be bested by a superb acting corps , and a well-written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs  
in directing his latest action-comedy , director brett ratner ( money talks ) takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all get-out buddy cop movie  
in addition , rush hour serves as a first-class example of directing a movie with conservative attitude - a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types

the other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago , knock off , stands no chance against the content of this one  
chan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise , and there's no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who couldn't believe their eyes the first time

1,"on the basis of this film alone , i never would have predicted that , in two years , quentin tarantino would become the country's biggest hotshot director  
reservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction , but is a much less substantive , more conventional crime story than the big pf  
here's what the two movies do have in common    
--scenes of intelligent , amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot --a story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in a logical , chronological sequence --graphic yet necessary violence --an engaging crime story --dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racial/gender slurs --three of the same actors ( harvey keitel , tim roth and steve buscemi ) --a mexican standoff ending , although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf

id4 opened in the us on 2nd of july , and up till now , only after a week of release , it has nearly touched the us$100 million mark , a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in 1993  
the premise of the movie is disgustingly simple : earth defends itself against the aliens , a typical and highly popular 50's hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era  
the movie opens via star wars , however unoriginal it may be , it worked  
the aliens have sent a large mother ship ( supposedly to be 1/4 size of the moon ) to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth

1,"i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars  
from my first viewing , i noticed that david mamet's film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning

the spanish prisoner , like the usual suspects or chinatown , begs for the viewer's complete attention  
miss a scene or even a small detail , and you could miss the meaning of the entire film

mamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games

through the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a mob , fritz lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility

1,"for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and "" high art , "" the son's room is an inventive , subtle alternative  
written by , directed , and starring nanni moretti , it takes us through the slow , complicated path of bereavement  
slow is the best description for the film at first  
it takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal , happy family  
father and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities  
they laugh , spend free time together , and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder  
you get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome  
but suddenly , the son is found to be dead after a diving accident  
the family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it , but can also be trying on the attention span "
1,"i like movies with albert brooks , and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks  
lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies  
his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today , inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator  
you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film , while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent "" talk films "" which are finding their way into theaters  
the situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with , but even if we can't , brooks has the talent to make them comfortable , and therefore we laugh  
teenagers and jim carrey fans probably won't find an albert brooks movie very funny , but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will  
put simply , brooks' comedy is intelligent  
mother is albert brooks' latest film , and it does not disappoint  
brooks plays john henderson , a middle-aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce "
1,"synopsis : an attractive mute makeup artist , working on an ultra-cheesy slasher movie in moscow , witnesses the production of a brutal snuff film and is subsequently chased by really bad russians  
meanwhile , the artist's sister and boyfriend clumsily try to save her  
comments : mute witness came as a surprise to me the first time i watched it  
drawn by the clever artwork on the video box , i rented the film expecting a complete turkey  
mute witness , however , was original , offbeat , and well-made  
it's one of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about  
i've subsequently found it at most video rental places i visit , and it may be seen , on occasion , on the independent film channel  
the first hour of mute witness is extremely tense , as billy , the quite believable mute heroine , sees members of the russian mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film  
the rest of the film takes good advantage of billy's vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by powerful criminal figures "
1,"the laserman : somehow the title of writer-director-producer peter wang's film conjures up images of superheroes , like ultraman and spiderman  
you kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips  
as it turns out , the laserman _is_ about crime and about laser beams , but there aren't any superheroes  
instead , wang's film is populated by a group of refreshingly off-beat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot : new york city  
the laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity , eccentricity , and electricity  
the film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss ( marc hayashi ) , a chinese-american laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment  
he loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds

opening sequences almost always make or break action films  
when done properly , not only are they actually exciting , but they foreshadow things to come  
this film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie , but with a sense of the self-aware , enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in

1,"after watching "" rat race "" last week , i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that , when not laughing aloud , i had held a grin for virtually all of the film's 112 minutes  
saturday night , i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn't enjoy it as much the second time as the first  
 "" rat race "" is a great goofy delight , a dandy mix of energetic performances , inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness

1,"titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it's upsetting that it isn't  
the film , which cost $200 million+ to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it 'sunk' ( pun intended ) is a labour of love for cameron , who wrote and directed the film  
we all know that big budget dosen't mean great film ( see waterworld ( 1995 ) ) but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic  
but sadly , titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece ( although it is one of cameron's best films ) 
the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic  
they find a safe , and inside a picture of a woman  
the woman in the picture ( an old winslet ) tells the explorers that the picture is of her  
the explorers invite her over , and she then tells her story of titanic

1,"steve soderbergh's "" sex , lies , and videotape , "" which won the grand prize at the cannes film festival in 1989 , arguably began the resurgence of independent films  
made on a shoestring budget of $1  2 million , with then relatively unknown actors , it is a provocative , thoroughly original drama  
the film mostly focuses on the four central characters , all in their late 20's-early 30's  
ann ( andie macdowell ) , an unfulfilled housewife , is married to john ( peter gallagher ) , an insensitive lawyer , who , unbeknownst to her , is having an affair with her younger sister , cynthia ( laura san giacomo )  
complicating matters even worse is graham ( james spader , who won best actor at cannes ) , john's old college buddy , who comes to stay at their house  
ann is absolutely won over by him , even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex  
that is the set-up for the last hour of the picture , and since the film is entitled , "" sex , lies , and videotape , "" it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise  
director steven soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker , ranging from the independent , to the mainstream ( 1998's "" out of sight "" ) , to the downright kafkaesque ( 1997's "" schizopolis "" ) "
1,"damn those trailers  
had it not been for the advertising of this film , which reveals far too much about its contents , i would have been glued to `under the sand'

she takes a nap while he goes for a swim

1,"with the success of the surprise hit alien , directed by ridley scott , a sequel was inevitable  
in fact , after watching the first film , a sequel was wanted , particularly by this reviewer  
handing over the director's chair to recent box office gem james cameron , who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii , a surprisingly dull film , and terminator , making cameron a household name ) , the alien series got a face-lift of immense proportions  
instead of being a suspense/science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture  
what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created  
a film like aliens comes along only once in a while , and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it  
i never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have  
the terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear

1,"whenever writer/director robert altman works in a specific genre , he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms  
he made the west dirty in "" mccabe and mrs  miller "" ( 1971 ) , he parodied hard-boiled detective stories in "" the long goodbye "" ( 1973 ) , and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with "" popeye "" ( 1980 )  
the same holds true for his most recent film , "" the gingerbread man , "" which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years : the john grisham movie  
by the time "" the gingerbread man "" was completed , there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham  
there's no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise , matthew mcconaughey , chris o'donnell or matt damon , and it doesn't feature a great showdown in a courtroom  
instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession , "" the gingerbread man "" is a rain-soaked , southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters , a twisting plot line , black humor , a somewhat bleak ending , and even altman's trademark full-frontal female nudity  
the central character of the film is rick magruder , who is unlike any of grisham's other lawyer heroes  
he is older , experienced , and rich ; he drives a cherry-red $80 , 000 mercedes that never gets dirty , even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah , georgia , where the story unfolds "

the majority of scary movies signal the fact that a character is about to meet their demise with cheesy music , worn out dialogue such as "" i'll be right back , "" or simply with the overall tone of the scene

1,"the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be , in some ways  
in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint , and its series sequel the return of the saint , val kilmer plays simon templar , an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others  
this movie closely resembles a james bond flick  
it has the classic bond symbols : a man who can do just about anything and get away with it , a woman whom the man persues , a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal  
kilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie , although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations  
the movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests  
as a young boy , kilmer's character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork

1,"it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system  
no major surprise , when j  s  mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either

elizabeth i must face the decision to give up personal pleasures , and her lover ( joseph fiennes of shakespeare in love ) , in order to rule , successfully , the country , which she did for 40 more years  
both elizabeth and shakespeare in love are set in the elizabethian era , and both feature a queen elizabeth i ( judi dench plays her in love ) , or course

1,"in essence , good will hunting is an ordinary story told well  
taken as a whole , there's little that's special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path , leaves the audience with a warm , fuzzy feeling , and never really challenges or surprises us  
but it's intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) , strongly directed , and nicely acted  
so , while good will hunting is far from a late-year masterpiece , it's a worthwhile sample of entertainment  
like scent of a woman , which was released around this time of the season five years ago , good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world-weary veteran and a cocky young man  
the formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the characters are different  
al pacino's slade was a larger-than-life individual ; robin williams' sean mcguire is much more subtle

on january 3 of this year , director rob reiner basically re-released the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi  
based on the true story of 1963 civil rights leader medgar evars' assassination , ghosts of mississippi revolves around the 25-year legal battle faced by myrlie evars ( whoopi goldberg , sister act ) and her quest to have her husband's obvious assassin and racist byron de la beckwith ( james woods , casino ) jailed  
so she turns to assistant district attorney and prosecutor bobby delaughter ( alec baldwin , heaven's prisoners ) to imprison the former kkk member  
ghosts sets its tone with an opening montage of images from african-american history , from slave-ship miseries to life in the racist south of the 1960's  
but all too soon , the white folks take over , intoning lines like "" what's america got to do with anything ? 
this is mississippi ! "" 
as beckwith , james woods , with his head larded with latex most of the time as an old man , teeters between portraying evil and its character

1,"contact is a film that tries to do several different things  
it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr  ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey )

the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv's the x-files  
the aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else  
they know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person  
the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick's 2001 : a space odyssey  
most of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens "
1,"i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files  
first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie  
the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable  
you have to reach for a larger audience  
therefore , the movie is quite user-friendly  
altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange  
but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on  
you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera  
in any case , the answer is no "
1,"it is simply amazing how "" the green mile "" developed in its three hour running time  
based on the stephen king series of the same title , the film starts out painfully slow , with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue  
however , as the plot begins to progress , the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction  
frank darabont , who masterfully followed a prisoner's story in "" the shawshank redemption "" , this time follows the perspective of a prison guard , paul edgecomb ( tom hanks )  
through edgecomb's experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent , the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law  
from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner , "" the green mile "" is successful in creating sympathy for kind-hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners  
the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them  
the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb  
the ensemble acting in the film is perfect "

1,"synopsis : rumored to be about a true person , the story of mulan has circulated in oral tradition for over a thousand years , and has inspired operas , literature , and even coinage  
 ( since 1984 , china has been issuing annual gold and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures ; the 1992 set includes mulan  ) 
in the ballad of mulan ( written in the 5th or 6th century ) , an imperial edict by the khan ( emperor ) orders men from each family to be drafted into the army to defend china  
a girl's parents hear sighing , and think that their daughter mulan ( the name means magnolia ) is dreaming of boys , but actually she's dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm father if he were to be drafted off to battle  
mulan bravely runs away , masquerading as a boy , to serve in the army instead of her father  
ten thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later , the army finally returns in triumph  
the emperor wants to reward mulan's valor with a prestigious position in government , but she declines , accepts a horse , and returns home quietly to don her true clothes  
mulan's old army buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that mulan is actually a woman  
the disney animated feature mulan is similar to the ballad story , only it adds a modern character for comic relief : mushu the dragon ( eddie murphy ) "
1,"in 1987 the stock market crashed , and oliver stone's wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses  
wall street lucked out in its timing ; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had , and though its kill-or-be-killed approach to business was exaggerated , that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan-era businessman  
stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs  evil tale relayed in the fast-paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange  
critics and audiences lauded wall street , elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic  
i'm proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them  
i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone's output with its thin caricatures , obvious sentiments , and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen  
stone goes for broke in every scene ( the same could be said for nearly all of his works )  
this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions "
1,"there's a moment in schindler's list when a number of jews are trudging through snow , clean and crisp , dark edges and frost on the ground

synopsis : american actress gwyneth paltrow with dark hair , playing a londoner ? 
believe it  
sliding doors is a love 'what if' story  
the gimmick is that it's really two stories : the film follows the life of helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) down two directions  
in the beginning , likeable gal 'helen' ( gwyneth paltrow ) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job  
so she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and her sleeping live-in lover gerry ( john lynch )  
helen doesn't know it , but she is at a fateful junction in life : 1 ) if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2 ) if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future  
the film shows what happens in both paths , switching back and forth between intertwined , parallel stories  
in story one , helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james ( john hannah ) on the train  
arriving home early , she discovers that her live-in , gerry ( john lynch ) , is having sex with his former lover lydia ( jeanne tripplehorn ) "
1,"apocalypse now , based on the novel "" hearts of darkness "" , is an extremely striking , gripping , and horrifying depiction of the vietnam war from another angle

apocalypse now is probably one of the most memorable vietnam war films ever made  
in addition , now film has gone to the extremes that this film does - a disturbing look at the corruption and terrifying effects of the most devastating war of recent years

1,"since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller "" blood simple , "" joel and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic , original , and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood  
their films are highly stylized , deeply embedded in a particular time and place , and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances  
in "" the big lebowski , "" their first cinematic offering since the multiple academy award-winning "" fargo , "" the action takes place in los angeles during the gulf war , and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski , aka the dude  
the dude is played by jeff bridges -- one of hollywood's most underrated actors -- in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high  
the dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties  
he has shaggy , shoulder-length hair , a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim , and he wears mostly stained tee-shirts , long shorts , and gellies without socks  
he smokes a lot of pot , drinks a lot of white russians , and is more than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with his two buddies , a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) , one of those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation , but never quite makes it in

1,"apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x  i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether  
i've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce  
as it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton  
it's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star  
norton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year

1,"i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater , on a sunday afternoon  
when the movie was over and the audience was exiting , i didn't hear one negative comment , and i didn't have any to offer  
simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys , simon ( ian michael smith ) and joe ( joseph mazzello ) , and what destiny holds for both of them  
simon is a dwarf , who was not supposed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart  
surprisingly , he does , and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle  
simon thinks god has a plan for him , a purpose for his life , and his condition , he just doesn't know what  
joe is an illegitimate child ( referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard ) , who's mom ( ashley judd ) won't tell him who his father is

1,"if there's one thing in common about all of hollywood's major studios , it's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more  
although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it's obvious there's no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater  
so when a movie like gary ross' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it's a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes  
although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie  
quite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen  
the story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema  
not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough  
kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture  
it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named "" pleasantville "

1998's 'hope floats' was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year  
we always get films that make big money at the box-office but critics and audiences pan on them  
this year 'double jeopardy' is one of those films

1,"logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility  
considering that the skeptic's best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities , writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task

terry gilliam's "" 12 monkeys "" was one such film

there is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ?

neither does he make the climactic moment of victory a competition between the hero and some mean-spirited token rival  
suo gives his comedy the graceful movements of his subject matter , allowing the humor to flow from the characters rather than forcing it upon them

1," "" dangerous beauty "" is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583  
it is beautifully filmed , wonderfully acted , and certainly nothing short of entertaining , but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness  
dealing with themes of forbidden love , religious intolerance , subordination of women , sexual freedom , and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high-cultured society , it still feels like brightly lit fluff  
the director , marshall herskovitz , doesn't want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down , so he opts for a more genial , livelier , and relatively shallow interpretation  
the film takes place during the renaissance , a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe  
at this time , venice was its own republic , and it thrived on being the central juncture of east-west commerce  
the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice , so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived  
however , there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes , their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment

since "" awakenings "" was so very good , and made my top ten list the year it was released , "" at first sight "" is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall , but is still an intelligent and vibrantly-acted drama  
the film begins as amy ( mira sorvino ) , a stressed-out new york architect , decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country  
at the hotel she is staying at , she makes a massage appointment and after a long , soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions , she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil ( val kilmer ) , only to find out later that he is actually blind  
amy doesn't really care if he has a handicap or not , and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love  
once she has returned to new york , amy begins to research on virgil's certain type of retinal blindness , which he has had since three years of age , and out of a stroke of luck , comes into contact with a doctor ( bruce davison ) who believes he can repair virgil's sight , even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history  
at first reluctant , virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery , much to the hesitance of his overbearing , but loving older sister ( kelly mcgillis )  
ultimately , the surgery is a success , but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees , since he has never visually seen anything before , only touched objects  
he moves into amy's apartment and she is eager to stand by him , but virgil's maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship "

computer generated aliens  
ok , the movie is not just about computer generated aliens  
it's about computer generated aliens and a secret organization known as mib

the computer graphics in this movie are spectacular , they make you want to believe that aliens like the ones depicted exits  
since seeing this movie i have to agree concede that denis rodman is an alien , he simply has to be

[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good seats , sound and picture] 
do you realize that every time you encounter a new person you've just become part of a story ? 
everyone has their own life story , both past and present , and every time two or more interact , they become part of each others' story ( not necessarily an important or even significant part , but a part nevertheless )  
that seems to be the basic theory behind `go , ' where several characters' chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways  
in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn't usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them , such as a teenage supermarket cashier , a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors  
these types of characters might not sound all that original , but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father , a mid-level drug dealer , a narc obsessed with multi-level-marketing , horny wedding guests , a zen lovemaker , two shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out "

words "" croatia "" and "" croatians "" were unheard , even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations  
the rare exception was the dogs of war , 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth's bestselling novel , yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury , by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context  
in a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people , probably terrorists , who happen to remove parts of arm dealers' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise

as jacob , the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxton's hank , thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers  
three men , hank ( paxton ) , jacob ( thornton ) and their friend lou ( brent briscoe ) stumble upon a plane wreck which , upon closer inspection , yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money  
jacob and lou want to pocket the cash  
hank , the smarter - and perhaps more naive - of the three , insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find

things start going wrong , though , with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan  
disaster is sure to strike

when it comes to modern gangster movies , it's really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word "" routine  "" 
i've always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it's been used before ) can provide for a good story and "" donnie brasco "" clinches this idea  
it's not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another's style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale  
the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it  
we meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk  
he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this

1,"let me open this one with a confession : i love cop movies  
i adore them with such an unwavering , near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998's one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers , steven  
was it any good ? 
well , just about as good as baldwin's steven seagal impression ( for those i've confused the answer is a resounding no ! )  
now let me clarify , i don't love just any cop movie ; i'm not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80's and now slowly ( gulp ) returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker  
i'm partial to those gritty , earthy cop dramas like serpico , donnie brasco , and the french connection  
problem is these films come along just about as often as george w  bush makes a cogent point so whenever a "" true "" cop movie does hit multiplexes , i come running towards it like an eager puppy ? ? ? and inevitably i leave , head bowed , tripping over my squiggly tail  
so what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $7  50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin-off , no ? ) ? 
truth is i'm a sucker for those barren streets , that gritty , graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops , like modern day knights , must shield us from their iniquitous clutches "
1,"when i was asked to see this movie with a friend , my initial reaction was ? not hugh grant ! ' 
i was perhaps wrong to be so harsh , but after his insidious flirtation with a street hooker , i just could not picture him in any romantic lead  
what makes this movie a wonderful experience is not the fact it stars hugh , but because it stars julia and carries with it a brilliantly written script  
this writer richard curtis , whose exceptional first work ? four weddings and funeral' shows us that he is a master in the domain of the romantic comedy , with splashes of drama thrown in between  
hugh and his hair , is almost identical to the character that made him famous in ? four weddings'

1,"david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director  
with his distinctive , more often than not ingenious dialogue , and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible  
some of them tend to be thickly layered , deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message , or sometimes even a concealed storyline  
and although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors , it is still a brilliantly complex , consistently riveting motion picture about honor , about sacrifice , and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right  
oh , and it's rated g  
incidentally , this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else's work ; namely a play by terrence rattigan , set in the 19th century

1,"perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects  
there is no question that action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise  
whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology  
the latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie's story  
unlike many sci-fi movies which promote themselves as effects-heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event  
it runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film's length  
contrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound  
in this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp

1,"i'm not quite sure what to say about mars attacks ! , which is obviously the work of a deranged genius  
when tim burton's twisted alien invasion comedy really works , it's breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure  
and when it doesn't work , it's just dull  
i'm not even sure it works more often than it doesn't , but where it counts -- that is , when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come -- mars attacks ! 
is brilliant  
mars attacks ! 
is based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s , and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer's independence day -- old alien invasion flicks , disaster movies , and big-budget special effects extravaganzas  
but unlike independence day , which was a painfully middle-of-the-road appeal to the hearts , minds and wallets of america , mars attacks ! 
has a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it  
the big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings , mars attacks ! 
portrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are  
the title sequence is just splendid -- an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation  
the spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past , and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman's thundering , theremin-driven score is absolutely jaw-dropping "

1,"with many big-budget science fiction films , great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts , cheesy plot twists , and , terrible acting  
the fifth element , the abyss , and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting , writing , or both

it's an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films ( most obviously the terminator films , star wars , and total recall ) , but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout

it was bouncy and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon , the man who had brought us the humorous swingers a little while back  
the result ? 
a movie that's just as good as that song , really  
it follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend  
first we hear about a grocery bagger ( sara polley ) who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave ( with bad results , as a drug dealer feels he's been swindled by her ) ; then comes the story of an english grocery store worker ( same store ) who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends , where sex , gunplay , and stolen car trouble come into play ; then we see the story of two gay movie actors ( played by scott wolf and jay mohr ) who deal with a cop's strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl ( sara ) with their car ; and , finally , we come to another grocery worker ( katie holmes ) who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer ( the one mentioned earlier )  
really , it's all confusing to keep track of in review format , your best bet is to just , well , go  
the movie features some very good acting from all angles , and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product

i can't decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat , but i'm pretty sure andrew niccol , screenwriter for the truman show , has had the same curious thought  
the truman show is about a man ( jim carrey ) whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public  
since birth , he's been living in the fictional island town of seahaven , fla  , which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign  
all the people in truman burbank's life are actors , and the anonymous townfolk paid extras  
people watch truman's life 24 hours a day , live , with no commercial interruptions

1,"with the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lately , what with that whole clinton thing going on ( you know , 100 million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern - oh , please , government , waste my taxes just a bit more , would you ? ) , 
it's about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement  
with this and "" crimson tide , "" he's created two successfully chilly films that are interesting , exciting , even pretty smart , but never totally riveting as cinema , and the problem i think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying , and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart  
that film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not to follow rules or question them , and was appropriately scary and all , but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant  
 "" enemy of the state "" is the same way : it's engrossing for its entire running time , and it's scary the way that it shows a man's decent into kafkaism , but it's too technical  
it's too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be  
it casts will smith , one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because he's charming and witty and never uninteresting , and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be a person  
i hate to do this , but last year's film "" the game "" got it damn perfect : it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being , a man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life , and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened  
the result was not only a film that was exciting and chilling , but also the best mindfuck of the entire year  
not that i want every kafkaesque film to be "" the game "" ( this year's "" the spanish prisoner "" succeeds with less thrills and chills ) , but it should be an example of what works and what doesn't "

sure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules  
but nothing entirely groundbreaking  
with the release of the studio's newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough's creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques  
it's no classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be  
the plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa  
but , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib  
found by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own

and everyone should know how i feel about remakes , especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you're going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea )  
this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list , and was actually quite the opposite  
contemporary live-action-disney films are not one of my favorties , anyway : they're usually unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10

rush hour 
so what's the problem with 48 hours clones these days ? 
they always try for the same thing that eddie murphy and nick nolte had  
that was the problem that plagued these clones , not to mention the actual sequel : another 48 hours , a complete waste of film  
but , at last , someone has a different take on the matter , and it's director brett rainer

of course , the fbi is upset that he'll be interfering in their investigation , and stick him with an lapd office with a big mouth- of course , that's chris tucker

1,"for the first reel of girls town , you just can't get over lili taylor  
is it possible to remain unperturbed that a woman of this age is playing a high school student ? 
harder still , can you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in the part ? 
with the sure , showy expertise of a de niro , taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all the faux fuck-you confidence she can muster  
it's a deeply felt , dead-on performance , and by the halfway point you've forgiven taylor her own maturity  
for all its verite pretenses , girls town is less about a bunch of high-schoolers than it is about a movie director and a cadre of writer-performers examining their own feelings about rape , relationships , and american womanhood  
the movie's opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of four smart/sassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation : patti , angela ( bruklin harris ) , emma ( anna grace ) , and nikki ( aunjanue ellis )  
but about 10 minutes into the film , we get word that nikki has swallowed a fistful of pills and bowed out of life  
the remaining girls manage to smug nikki's diary out of her grieving mother's home , and page through it at patti's place , investigating the root of nikki's despair  
what they find is cruel and galvanizing -- nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned , and was privately questioning the sanity and value of a world where such a thing could happen

often science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller

but , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic  
such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman

this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas's the three musketeers  
by bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting  
the end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip-off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu

-1,"director luis mandoki's last film was the superb , serious 1994 drama "" when a man loves a woman , "" but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture , "" message in a bottle , "" which is the worst type of romance , a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up  
everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before---and much better---so there's an absence of suspense , and the film ultimately moves at such a very , very deliberate pace , as if it is trying to make great , "" meaningful "" statements and plot developments , that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through  
 "" message in a bottle "" begins with theresa osborne ( robin wright penn ) , a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune , whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day  
inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine , and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and , to her objection , finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper  
soon , a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message , and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake , theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks , a boating town in north carolina , to find out the specifics of the message  
of course , garrett turns out to be a handsome , rugged man around theresa's age and played by kevin costner  
she is immediately charmed by him , but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there , and finds that catherine was garrett's late wife who died a few years earlier  
do you think you know where this is headed ? 
most likely you do , and i wouldn't call it giving away anything to say that by the picture's end , the movie has fallen into deep , artificial melodrama that i didn't buy for a second  
if there are any positive things to say about "" message in a bottle , "" it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman , as garrett's stubborn , but loving father , are far above par to be in such a wasteful , "" shaggy dog "" love story , and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast , and paints chicago as an equally alluring city "

 "" pulp fiction "" and "" fargo "" both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture , and not surprisingly , a slew of rip-offs followed in the years thereafter  
that fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing "" the way of the gun "" that at first glance looks like another of those wanna-be's but upon closer inspection doesn't look like anything comprehendable  
it's a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that won't allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous  
complexity should come as no surprise to anyone who's familiar with mcquarrie , he wrote "" the usual suspects , "" which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim  
that film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate , confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings  
you have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that "" if it's really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating  "" 
with "" the way of the gun "" mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea , but this time the story is far less commercial - a shame because maybe that would have helped

the result is a mix of genres that don't mesh well  
elements of the ritz brothers-style comedy ( for those few who remember that comedic troupe from the 1939 "" the three musketeers "" ) , the man with no name from "" a fistful of dollars "" ( d'artagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western ) and hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano  
the result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the "" matrix "" crowd  
alexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters  
the real problem with the "" the musketeer "" lies in the casting of the two lead , romantically intertwined characters , d'artagnan and francesca ( mena suvari )

somehow , chucky moaning about mid life crisis , and how he should have gotten married does not make for a very scary chucky  
and tiffany harping about mid life crisis , and how she should have gotten married does not make for a very scary tiffany

with an anemic plot and not-quite-kosher special effects , _john carpenter's vampires_ has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan  
the film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers , led by james woods , of all people  
like some sort of holy a-team ( they even have their own souped-up van ) , the bunch invade and wipe out a nest of vampires in a new mexico shack "
-1," "" in dreams "" might keep you awake at night , but not because of its creepy imagery , bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths  
no , the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie's brutally squandered potential , the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise - even by tired serial killer genre standards  
the big letdown , however , comes upon the realization that this 100-minute head-scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan , the man behind "" the crying game  "" 
he's no stranger to cinematic weirdness , but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope  
things start out strong enough , with cinematographer darius khondji's stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat  
this eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film - there's even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic , seemingly innocent new england autumn - but if there ever was a film that didn't deserve so good a polish , it's this one  
don't knock the look , but say what you will about the foolish plot , underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue  
annette bening , another asset "" in dreams "" shouldn't be so lucky to boast , gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesn't do much for her in return

reviewed by dennis schwartz 
a bleak indie film about a stolen identity  
there's not much more to this visually stylish film than what meets the eye , as it relies on shock to tell its story of a prolonged vicious mugging  
it falls into the category of being a pretentious art-house film , leaving a bitter taste in one's mouth as it stereotypes its characters and unintentionally further inflames the racial issues  
it tries to make a heavy-handed point about disenfranchised black youths trapped by their environment , with their only way out being crime  
but the story is so filled with violence and its nyc setting looks like hell , that it's hard to enjoy this film and to follow what the logic in the story is supposed to mean  
the relationship between the black mugger and his white victim is a cloudy one , which the film never determines what it wants to say about it  
matt mahurin is virtual one-man crew in putting this film together ( director/writer /cinematographer/editor ) , who is a still photographer in his day job  
the film works best as a visually challenging piece , as each shot looks like a photograph carefully telling the story unfolding

the only solution that his wife ( magda szubanski , going from delightfully charming to downright annoying ) can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair ( i think ) and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank ( set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public )

and what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is a recruit on his first day of training  
or what about when brenner tells a suspect that , because he is in the military , he doesn't have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights were central to military law well before the miranda decision  
how hard is it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts ? 
now details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up , but this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through

the filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter "" i still know , "" the longer "" i still know what you did two summers ago "" or the appropriate "" stupid people getting hacked to bits  "" 
that last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that are the polar opposite of smart  
for example , if your roommate is plagued by terrible nightmares as a result of being stalked and nearly murdered not long ago , would you sneak into her room late at night and hide in the closet , even if it was just to locate and borrow a cute little dress ? 
probably not , but that's precisely what college student karla ( pop diva brandy ) does to best friend julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , resulting in the first in a long line of phony frights

good truck driver jack crews ( swayze ) must drive a cargo of illegal firearms from atlanta to new jersey

-1,"tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie  
the film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it's evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster  
enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious  
the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium  
tectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences  
it's not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , "" look ! 
art ! "" ) , 
although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters  
because we're constantly made aware that we're watching a play or a movie , it's impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer's ideas  
they're not real , sympathetic , or believable

in vegas vacation clark griswold ( chase ) decides to take the family on vacation to las vegas so that he and wife ellen ( d'angelo ) can renew their wedding vows  
it is at this point when comedy is supposed to ensue  
apparently the filmmakers thought that putting the griswolds into las vegas would be so funny on its own that they wouldn't bother to write any jokes into the script  
at least that's the way it looks when watching this turkey  
about half way through vegas vacation i began to have serious doubts as to whether there would actually be a single laugh in the entire film , since there had been none up to that point "
-1,"plot : a rich psychiatrist with a great home life gets his cute daughter kidnapped by some bad guys who want him to extract some information from the mind of one of his nutty patients  
of course , the patient is not cooperative and the doctor only has a few hours to comply with their demands , before they kill his daughter  
pretty good premise , no ? 
critique : if you're not a fan of movies packed with plot holes , inconsistencies and yes , even more plot holes , heed my words and skip this hollow thriller  
and i don't like saying that either , since this film actually had some potential and started off pretty well  
sure , the story is basically just an amalgamation of ransom , primal fear and nick of time pureed into one , but the whole "" psychiatrist working against the clock "" thing , actually had me engaged at first  
but it's at about the halfway mark of this movie , that the bottom drops out and all that we're left with are a lot of questions and very few plausible answers  
we get the overly smart kid who manages to "" pull one "" over on the bad guys  
we get a weak woman with her leg in a cast beating the crap out of a tough bad guy  
we get douglas' character , a new york uppedity psychiatrist , suddenly turning into an action hero , with moves and attitude to boot "

paleontology is no longer the sexy science it once was since the ingen corporation cloned his subject matter

when the kirbys ( william h  macy , "" fargo "" ; tea leoni , "" the family man "" ) ask him to be their guide for an anniversary flyover of isla sorna ( the notorious site b of "" the lost world "" ) he's disdainful , but once they wave their checkbook , he reconsiders  
however the kirbys haven't given dr  grant their real agenda in "" jurassic park iii  ""

-1,"well arnold has completed the seemingly impossible task  
he has made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films  
in a domain that he owns , it is very surprising that this goliath of an action star can not tell a good action script from a bad one  
eraser , back in 1996 , was a confused film that made no attempt at all to make sense  
batman and robin , in 1997 , was the black sheep of the batman series with ridiculous acting , idiotic action scenes , and painfully flashy costumes  
now in 1999 , "" end of days "" ( not "" the end of days "" ) is the third strike in a tough at bat for arnold  
is this the end of a powerful action star's long-lived career ?

or an unforgettable performance in a great guilty pleasure like those in the past ( "" commando "" , "" red sonja "" , "" true lies "" ) ? 
it doesn't look that way

in fact not many people even knew what pokemon was , but in 1999 it hit big with kids and adults alike , and became one of the biggest franchises and merchandise seller of all time  
in fact it even spawned a big screen adventure pokemon : the first movie which for what it was , wasn't all that bad  
it grossed $31 million in its opening weekend , and went on to make almost $90 million  
fans thought it was great and now is a second movie in the pokemon craze , "" pokemon : the movie 2000 "" which is far inferior to the original animated movie  
first up is the plot , which there really isn't much of , in fact the plot what there is : a bad guy trying to destroy the ancient never before seen pokemon , lugia , is about it , except the fact that ash kethcum the worlds best pokemon trainer must try and stop him before he destroys this one pokemon forever  
well there you go , of course ash is followed by his friends misty , brock , gary and his pokemon friends , pikachu , squirtle , charizard , the usual

 "" earthquake "" is basically notable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured  
on video , it's a bland and slow-moving film which gives us a bunch of different characters ( the disaster film requisite ) , then brings them together in the struggle against the big disaster  
while this worked in , say , "" the towering inferno , "" it doesn't here for one single reason : we don't care about any of the characters  
the film gives us charlton heston ( in one of many crap 70s films he made , including "" skyjacked "" and that classic , "" soylent green "" ) as a rich man married to ava gardner , who is having a little affair with a young single mom ( genieveve bujold ) ; a renegade police officer on suspension ( george kennedy , in his least humored performance ) ; in the second weirdest subplot , a motorcycle stuntman ( richard roundtree , right after his "" shaft "" thing ) whose big stunt is he goes on a little track that goes upside down ( yea , snore ) ; and the weirdest subplot : a military man/bag boy at a grocery store who has a little thing for buxom victoria principal , and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of his hair ( ! ! ! )

-1," "" tarzan and the lost city "" is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while  
not only it is poorly written , badly acted , and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas , it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid  
unfortunately , it's not bad in the way great , colossal misfires like "" heaven's gate "" ( 1980 ) or "" ishtar "" ( 1987 ) were bad  
instead , it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with , which begs the question of why it was made in the first place  
with all the good scripts lying around hollywood un-produced , how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ? 
of course , tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films , which have ranged from the very good ( 1984's "" greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes "" ) down to the really bad ( 1981's "" tarzan , the ape man "" with bo derek )  
most of these films were just cheapie b-movies made in the thirties and forties , starring ex-olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps  
therefore , if another tarzan movie is to be made , one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle , an original storyline , anything to set it apart from all the others  
 "" greystoke "" added a never-before-seen level of realism to the pulpy tale , and even "" tarzan , the ape man "" at least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek's bare breasts  
 "" tarzan and the lost city , "" on the other hand , has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue "

it is hard to tell what is independent about this film ; it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam  
it is the debut film for the director , who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults , a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s , where the mind-set of all the characters depicted is grounded , but to see it in the 1990s is a different story : it is old news  
the love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesn't mean much , since their relationship remained undeveloped  
the introduction of the wise-guy angle and the loyality among buddies bit , are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tour-de-force performance by the star of the film , adrien brody as ray

van sant's controversial "" re-telling "" of alfred hitchcock's classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere ( even before it premiered  ) 
without benefit of an actual viewing , many have said that the film will , at best , suck  
being an ( almost ) good critic , i waited until i actually saw it to decide that the film , at best , sucked ( and that concludes the use of the word "" suck "" and , hopefully , the thoughts that i am a brain-dead orangutan  ) 
director gus van sant took the original hitchcock film and refilmed it , shot-for-shot , using the same , exact script ( with a few minor alterations  ) 
the inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful and scary , even though a large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time  
suspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to create something new or different than the original

something smells rotten in the state of california right from the get-go : cotton weary ( liev schrieber ) , the former lover and would-be killer of maureen prescott , sidney's mother , is juggling phone calls in his luxury car  
 ( once considered a danger to society , weary now hosts his own talk show , "" 100% cotton "" , a clever , if dated , jab at american pop culture  )

it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street , whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just * doesn't * die  
a ridiculous concept , yes , but at this point i'm willing to accept it because i'm willing to accept that this is how amanda's life is changed , how her powers are received "
-1,"the above is dialogue from this film , taken almost completely in context , and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is  
it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film , and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about , especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously  
mr  gregg "" i'm-having-a-mid-life-crisis "" araki , the writer and director of this film , wants to show how important teenagers are , and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible , horrible world  
and how does he show it ? 
by really cheap surrealism , and moronic exchanges like this  
oh , and it gets better  
a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of , oh i dunno , the fiftieth sex scene in this film ( i'm not counting the several masturbation scenes )  
in it , one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another , and he says to her something along the lines of "" do you ever wonder what life is all about ? "" 
sorry , man : foreplay takes place before the act of coitus  
of course , what do you expect : the film was written and directed by a guy who can't even spell his first name right ( yes , i know it's a cheap joke , but it had to be done ) "

the teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy

-1,"this well-conceived but ultra sugary coming-of-age film is not for everyone , and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion  
joseph cross ( joshua beal ) is a 10-year-old who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather ( loggia ) to bone marrow cancer  
loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner , it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup  
the beals are like a sitcom idyllic family , where everyone is just so nice and affluent , and properly religious without being fanatical  
the beals , the father ( denis leary ) and his wife ( dana delany ) , are both successful doctors ; julia stiles plays joshua's older sister , needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him  
this is a family seemingly conceived in heaven , but living in south philadelphia , sending their children to a well-run catholic school  
joshua , the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn , is a handsome , sweet , intelligent , friendly , and endearing child , who does well in school , relates to the nuns and priests , and talks politely to his well-meaning parents  
all this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch  
the plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather , who promised to be with him forever "
-1,"sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality  
he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades , like twelve angry men , serpico or the verdict  
but , in the same time , almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet's reputation  
a stranger among us , 1992 rip-off of peter weir's witness , belongs to the latter category  
the heroine of this movie is emily eden ( melanie griffith ) , tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york  
during one of such actions , her partner nick ( jamey sheridan ) got hurt and as a result , she becomes depressed

-1,"there's no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based , as its opening credits proclaim , on a true story  
but if it's an accurate picture of life on america's mean streets , than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought  
for from the film's outset , when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles ( not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading ) donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction  
our eponymous hero ( johnny depp ) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be  
brasco is joseph pistone , an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming-up to lefty ( al pacino ) , a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a "" wiseguy ""  
regrettably , pistone learns his lessons all too well  
his concern for lefty , who is burdened with a heroin addicted son , exacerbates his own family troubles : his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband's gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing  
true , the focus on pistone's family life does deviate from the typical gangster-flick formula , but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins  
the unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn-out domestic squabbles ? including an ill-advised marriage guidance routine ? that slow the film down unnecessarily "

oddly , `eye of the beholder , ' which is a psychological-romance-thriller , starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a british intelligence agent , called the eye ( ewan mcgregor ) , working in washington dc  
in the humorous opening scene , he eyes a top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down  
using an array of high-tech surveillance and communications equipment , he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens and fax machines in his office

those movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of political correctness , coinciding with the 500th anniversary of columbus' discovery of america  
one of such examples is geronimo : an american legend , 1993 western directed by walter hill , film that deals with one of the last conflicts between american natives and white settlers

i mean , a really , really , bad movie  
not only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood , gore and body parts shown on the screen , it blissfully jumps over that line , apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds ( of which i saw many in the theatre )  
looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence , we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best , no strong lead characters , a blatant disregard for physics , and a very obvious naziesque theme  
that being said , onto the review : the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation ( who's logo bears a * strong * resemblance to a nazi german eagle ) , urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs , who are attempting to destroy earth  
the film shows large rallies with young children in attendance , pledging allegiance to the federation ( again , sound familiar ? )

it's hard seeing arnold as mr  freeze in batman and robin , especially when he says tons of ice jokes , but hey he got 15 million , what's it matter to him ? 
once again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster , that can't compare with the likes of the terminator series , true lies and even eraser  
in this so called dark thriller , the devil ( gabriel byrne ) has come upon earth , to impregnate a woman ( robin tunney ) which happens every 1000 years , and basically destroy the world , but apparently god has chosen one man , and that one man is jericho cane ( arnold himself )  
with the help of a trusty sidekick ( kevin pollack ) , they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world ! 
parts of this are actually so absurd , that they would fit right in with dogma  
yes , the film is that weak , but it's better than the other blockbuster right now ( sleepy hollow ) , but it makes the world is not enough look like a 4 star film  
anyway , this definitely doesn't seem like an arnold movie

the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl  
the prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met  
if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should  
cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained

-1,"a fullyloaded entertainment review : website coming soon ! 
hunter s  thompson's fear and loathing in las vegas , written in 1971 , is already an american classic ; not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post-psychedelia of the 1960's , but also because it ushered in a new form of journalism known as "" gonzo ""  
soon after the book was written , hunter s  thomspon became the basis for a character in doonesbury known as uncle duke  
and that is the problem with fear and loathing in las vegas ( the movie  ) 
although the book is one of my favorites , i now agree with thompson's own assessment of the novel as "" unfilmable  "" 
the main problem is that the book , although detailing wild drug use and tripped-out adventures , was not written on the road

why someone would want to base an entire movie on one premise and then give that crucial detail away in the trailers is beyond me  
however , if they * hadn't * given it away , the film would've still been suprisingly devoid of suspense given its subject matter  
obviously , the producers thought they could remake "" the deep end of the ocean , "" throw in tommy lee jones and a couple of cliches and call it an action drama

-1,"here's something to chew on : what's the favorite food of big , cheesy-looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising ? 
the obvious answer to this question is cardboard , because that's the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature  
deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer  
in fact , considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas , perhaps it was  
the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore  
not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh ( both human and non-human ) been scattered in all directions  
we learn some bloody trivia , as well , such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red ( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains ) and what it does with half-digested leftovers  
i suppose deep rising's gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre , but it doesn't do much for me  
on the surface , and that's about the only level at which this film can be analyzed , deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic ( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens/titanic connection , since james cameron directed both )  
in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue-in-cheek mayhem of tremors , deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin "

mitch weaver ( norm macdonald ) and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna ( artie lange ) are losers in life : they were constantly picked on in school , and now they cannot hold regular jobs  
but as the trailer goes , "" there is one thing mitch weaver is good at--revenge  "" 
so he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting-even schemes into a marketable revenge-for-hire business called dirty work inc  
this should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy , but for a film called _dirty_work_ , what ensues is rather clean of spirit

when she and her comrades , appropriately dubbed "" the commander , "" "" the rookies , "" and the guy with the cool accent discover the town's residents slaughtered , they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents' head-chopping , alien-possessed clutches  
filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks , flashes-sideways , and viewpoint changes , ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill-conceived action sequences  
the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story

-1,"certainly no one would rent ed wood's glen or glenda ? 
expecting to see a good movie , but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didn't know was possible  
in fact , wood's infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison  
watching glen or glenda ? 
i found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together ; as a result , it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious  
the movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary , with endless , repetitive narration about transvestites , how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriend's clothes without being able to wear them , how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals , and how the main character , glen/glenda is ( as it reminds us probably half a dozen times ) "" not half man and half woman , but man and woman at the same time  "" 
the camera work is terrible-occasionally the camera lingers on , say , a closed door while the characters talk off-screen , or inexplicably zooms in on someone's ear or nose  
wood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage , which leads to voiced-over non-sequiturs like , "" yes , our world is a busy and frightening place , with so many people driving their automobiles  "" 
finally , there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit a frankenstein-style laboratory , delivering pointless lines such as , "" people

the film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens , two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches , spanning back 200 years  
at the start , their parents die when they are still children , and they go to live with their two zany aunts ( stockard channing and dianne wiest )  
switch to the present day , gillian , who is the stronger , more rebellious sibling , leaves home , and meets up with a dark , abusive guy ( goran visjnic ) , while sally stays in their hometown , meets and falls in love with a sweet , caring man , has two children , and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed ( come to think of it , she's not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes )  
when gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic , they accidentally murder him , and in desperation , bury the body in the backyard of their aunts' house

what doesn't make sense is how such high-profile and superb actors as john travolta , robert duvall , william h  macy , and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project , which is both dull and completely ineffective  
the film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama

jan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families' homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city's drinking water

and an avaricious east coast railroad baron , thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ) , is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value , aided by allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) and his infamous detectives who , back then , were just thugs who provided security  
but when ma james ( kathy bates ) becomes one of their victims , jesse and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith , ty o'neal , joe stevens ) form the james-younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad's supply lines , sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept  
plus there's romance - between jesse and a spunky hometown gal , lee mimms ( ali larter )

those two films weren't bad , just not very good , but with zwick's latest film , "" the siege , "" he has finally made one

it's not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity , but there it was nonetheless  
i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999  
in a word , it's the same thing that's wrong with so many movies circa 1999 : writing  
more to the point , it's the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you're telling a story about a relationship  
the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we're expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of attractive , pleasant people just because they're attractive and pleasant

-1,"fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade  
tragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies , but the quantity  
most of those movies were produced by cannon group , company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus  
those two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman , b- movie mentors of future hollywood legends  
unfortunately , that didn't happened , and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade , behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage , that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal  
sadly for bronson , that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead , and lowering his own reputation in process  
on the other hand , bronson could take comfort in a fact that those movies were extremely popular , especially among the audience 3 or 4 times younger than bronson himself  
one of such movies that seriously marred bronson's reputation is death wish 3 , third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974  
in the original movie , bronson played paul kersey , mild-mannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence "

this picture doesn't play like a comedy for children , so who is it aimed at ? 
and why is it told like a 91-minute sit-com instead of a feature film ? 
rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee , a total schmuck working at a huge corporation  
he obviously doesn't have a lot of self esteem and thinks he has to kiss up to get ahead , which he does by volunteering to coach the company's girls' soccer team

review : "" pearl harbor "" is a perfect example of movies as product rather than as art

what follows is the story of a president's bid to think for the good of his people , a rising reporter , the love story of two teenagers ( one of whom discovered the comet ) , and a team of astronauts on the ship `messiah' to save the world  
firstly , there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film ( nor is there anything outstandingly good about it ) , but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid

in the first half of the movie , we are already assaulted with segal's acting , ( he is not simply wooden ; he is like a wall ) , gratuitous violence , an incredible plot , sexist and even more gratuitous nudity , and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes  
by the end , it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers

if you're going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big-name actors and people who know woody allen , then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters ? 
while watching celebrity , i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people  
what he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self-deprecation  
celebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself , living in a world that he's familiar with , dealing with people like the ones he actually knows  
allen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture , in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more  
branagh plays lee simon , a journalist-turned-screenwriter who divorces his wife , robin ( judy davis ) , shacks up with some hot women ( famke janssen , charlize theron , winona ryder ) , and goes about trying to get big stars ( melanie griffith , leonardo dicaprio ) to read his script about an armored car robbery  
the usual elements of recent allen films are all here , including the sexual insecurity of the main character , lots of self-loathing women , and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another  
unless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally , it's not likely that you'll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity

scary movie 2 is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor , and it is not because the wayans brothers , shawn and marlon doing the writing and keenen ivory behind the camera , don't try  
what defeats them is the genre they have chosen to spoof  
the first movie - an outrageous , low-brow , savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream and i know what you did last summer - succeeded because of its take-no-prisoners attitude toward a type of film that was in vogue , familiar and popular  
in scary movie 2 , the filmmakers take on the haunted house-ghost story format which , if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting and house on haunted hill , did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the various teen slasher series  
scary movie 2 does start off promising with a wonderful spoof of the exorcist , featuring james wood in the max von sydow role and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn  
of course split pea soup is the punch line - an overabundant amount , which offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive

crystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous  
 "" america's sweethearts "" takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters  
it's a promising set-up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation

in panel-sized morsels , implausible plots and "" rambo "" -esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork , but on thirty foot silver screens , it's much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures  
spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons ( white ) who is framed by a corporate baddie ( played without irony by sheen ) , then set on fire and left for dead  
though the movie skimps on the next few plot points , here's what i could determine : said assassin then becomes the leader of satan's army , under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown ( leguizamo , grating as always )  
he is renamed , for reasons unbeknownst , spawn , and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon  
but when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child , he realizes that he can't be the evil superdemon he's expected to be , and he sets about avenging his untimely death  
typical of summer blockbusters , spawn is an effects-laden ninety minute rock video  
while the visions of hell are laughably crude ( think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man ) , spawn's prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold "

he's nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore , not that it was much of one

the year is 1985 , letting the whole film obsess with 80s nostalgia  
adam sandler is nice guy robbie , the titular wedding singer , who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits  
robbie's life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee , linda ( angela featherstone ) , leaves him at the altar

spice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band , the spice girls  
it's intended as a sort of hard day's night , but ends up simply hard to watch  
when watching the spice girls , i'm reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs , the snorks , or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name  
the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles , and about as talented  
there's ginger ( geri halliwell ) , the brainy one , sporty ( melanie chisholm ) , the athletic one , baby ( emma bunton ) , the childish one , posh ( victoria adams ) , the fashion-conscious one , and scary ( melanie brown ) , the one with a tongue pierced back so far you're almost certain the post sticks out her throat  
the film itself doesn't really have a plot  
it follows the girls as they travel here and there , culminating at their "" first live performance "" at albert hall  
the action , however , seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas  
the various misfires include : an alien encounter , a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls , the shooting of a spice girls documentary , a movie producer ( george wendt ) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie ( nearly all of which , though incredibly far fetched , seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up ) , a meeting with a pregnant friend ( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends ) , a boating adventure , a bus race , club-hopping ( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd "

-1,"there are scenes in "" the big hit "" that are so awful , they simply defy description  
the movie is infected with the same kind of blunderheaded idiocy and misplaced confidence that made "" last action hero "" ( 1993 ) such a chore to sit through

movies of this sort require a fine balance and careful tone , and the comedy is usually meant to work as catharsis for the violence  
 "" lethal weapon 2 "" ( 1989 ) is a perfect example of an action thriller that was also very , very funny

in the 1982 updating of mickey spillane's 1947 novel "" i , the jury , "" hard-boiled detective mike hammer is a vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze trans am , dresses like don johnson in "" miami vice "" with less pastels , and has sworn off alcohol  
however , he still smokes his lucky strikes , detests all forms of authority , and kills at a whim  
beyond that , the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy page-turner by spillane , probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writers  
the movie starts off with a bang : a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series , complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti ( "" rocky "" )  
after that , the movie and the book begin the same , with the murder of jack williams ( frederick downs ) , a one-armed detective and hammer's best friend  
hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack's death , and with the help of his devoted secretary , the blond and shapely velda ( laurene landon ) , and the alternately friendly / antagonistic police chief pat chambers ( paul sorvino ) , he is immediately on the killer's trail  
here the movie splits completely from the book , and dives into a convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia , the cia , one of hammer's vietnam vet buddies , and a kinky sex clinic

not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d  wood jr  has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time  
of course , wood's career can be explained by two things : he had no money and he had no talent  
boorman , on the other hand , cannot court such excuses to explain "" zardoz "" ( or his follow-up film , the equally awful "" exorcist ii : the heretic "" )  
boorman obviously had a sizable budget , a matinee idol movie star ( sean connery ) in the lead role , and although you wouldn't know it from this film , boorman does indeed have talent  
this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece "" deliverance "" ( 1972 ) , as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama "" hope and glory "" ( 1987 ) , the slightly over-conceived arthurian epic "" excalibur "" ( 1981 ) and the father-son jungle adventure "" the emerald forest "" ( 1985 )

the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy , stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera , instead shooting for the angle of a feel-good science fiction drama more akin to `2001 : a space odyssey'

brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off

the farrellys utilize in "" me , myself & irene "" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them  
this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult "

alas , word is filled with little but disappointment , a kooky mix of girl , interrupted and ransom , with michael douglas and company collecting a paycheck to plod through a vapid and dull kidnapping thriller  
douglas stars as nathan conrad , renowned new york psychologist , devoted father of jessie conrad ( skye mccole bartusiak ) , and loving husband to aggie conrad ( famke janssen )  
after a gang of jewel thieves , headed by sean bean's koster , kidnaps his daughter , nathan is forced to extract from his new patient , the catatonic and violent elisabeth burrows ( murphy ) , the location of some hidden bank job booty that her father hid from the koster gang a decade ago

the catch - nathan only has until five o'clock to solve the puzzle !

-1,"for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer , hard boiled , face off ) appears to have made an exciting , elegant , charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them  
sadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two-hour long episode of magyuver  
and not a particularly good one at that  
what went wrong ? 
mi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it'll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise's firing gun just so they can die really cool  
early on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic  
in one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other's eyes with come hither sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff  
prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another

with pierce brosnan in his third and reportedly last go-round as james bond 007 , "" the world is not enough "" is the best example to date that "" 'enough "" is enough  
in this , the 19th chapter in the seemingly-endless franchise featuring ian fleming's debonair british secret agent who likes his martinis--and his nemeses--shaken not stirred , the sub-inspired screenwriters have chosen to rehash all of the setups , stunts , and sexy encounters of the previous 18 bond flicks rather than coming up with anything the slightest bit original

we've got a couple of hot-to-trot babes without an ounce of acting ability between them

and , as has been the case since 1977's "" the spy who loved me , "" we've got a plot that has nothing whatsoever to do with anything conceived by mr  fleming "

masters of the universe was the pinnacle of what i was after for action figures : they combined science fiction and fantasy , had cool names like mekanek and stinkor and each came with its own little comic book to read  
of course , the animated series produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly successful television products in world history  
given the tremendous success of the toys and the cartoon ( not to mention its moderately successful spin-off she-ra : princess of power ) , it was inevitable that a production company would put two and two together , come with the result of "" trillions "" and make a live-action masters movie  
let's be blunt : masters of the universe is a very bad movie  
the story is painfully dull and mind-numbingly cliched ( hands up who * wouldn't * guess he-man and skeletor take their fight into the real world ) and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors ( dolph lundgren as he-man for one ) or good actors ( james tolkan , meg foster ) given such awful characters and dialogue that they can't help but seem terrible  
it is extremely clear that someone making the movie wanted it to be as good as star wars

whatever david lynch is selling , i'm not buying  
from the writer/director of "" blue velvet "" and "" twin peaks "" comes another dark , mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive , the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills  
dazed , a beautiful brunette ( laura elena harring ) emerges and stumbles down a hill , slipping unobserved into a '30s-style apartment as the tenant leaves for a trip  
the next morning , a dewy blonde ( naomi watts ) from deep river , ontario , arrives in la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase  
her aunt owns the apartment and the two women meet  
the brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust  
meanwhile , a hotshot director ( justin theroux ) , whose wife is in bed with the poolman , is forced to cast a certain actress in his new film and there's an assassin ( mark pellegrino ) roaming the city  
the tortuous paths of these various characters - and others named cookie , coco and cowboy - intersect at various points but the plot remains elusive because , midway through the story , lynch has the brunette and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality , leaving a huge wad of cash , a blue metallic key , a paralyzed mogul and a lot of questions that go unanswered  
elena harring and particularly naomi watts are gifted actresses , effectively making the subtle switch "

is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy , sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ? 
is it about the business itself , how , bubbling just beneath the surface of big-town americana , there's a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won't necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ? 
or is it about those who can , those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see ?

wading through this gooey , detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic  
those hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris o'donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere ; `the bachelor' is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few brief moments of surprising poignancy  
awaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money  
although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty-boy cocoon , chris o'donnell has an effortless charm as an actor

-1,"topless women talk about their lives falls into that category that i mentioned in the devil's advocate : movies that have a brilliant beginning but don't know how to end  
it begins by introducing us to a selection of characters who all know each other  
there is liz , who oversleeps and so is running late for her appointment , prue who is getting married , geoff , liz's boyfriend , neil , her previous boyfriend , ant who has written a screenplay  
for the first hour , we get to know these people through everyday activities , as they talk on the phone , go out to dinner , hang clothes on the line  
the interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the film-makers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst to them  
at times , the events border on the ridiculous , like the screening of the film , but they still seem in keeping with the characters and their lives  
this doesn't sound like a brilliant premise for a film - "" we just follow a lot of people around who are vaguely related "" - but it's the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing  
unfortunately this level of honesty isn't maintained  
with about half an hour to go , a sense of impending doom invades topless women talk about their lives and from there is descends into melodrama "

it shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives  
and how at the end of the day , the things that matter most are love , truth and honesty  
although in one sense it may seem tedious , making a movie about the ugliness of greed ( not box office material ) , it does become tedious , not because of the morale ending , but because one expects the movie to end that way  
this becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime , the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there

those who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star

one stormy night , the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder

-1,"how do films like mouse hunt get into theatres ? 
isn't there a law or something ? 
this diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilberg's dreamworks studio is hollywood family fare at its deadly worst  
mouse hunt takes the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and flat-out stupid slapstick that makes comedies like jingle all the way look decent by comparison  
writer adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill  
the plot , for what its worth , concerns two brothers ( nathan lane and an appalling lee evens ) who inherit a poorly run string factory and a seemingly worthless house from their eccentric father  
deciding to check out the long-abandoned house , they soon learn that it's worth a fortune and set about selling it in auction to the highest bidder  
but battling them at every turn is a very smart mouse , happy with his run-down little abode and wanting it to stay that way  
the story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe  
whatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue , terrible overacting , and increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all sound and fury , signifying nothing  
the script becomes so unspeakably bad that the best line poor lee evens can utter after another run in with the rodent is : "" i hate that mouse "" "
-1,"another formula 'feel good' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like "" waking ned devine , "" and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line  
it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin  
the strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol  
the film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas  
but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message  
its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the 'war on drugs' is about to be escalated into colombia  
the drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america's jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america's drug usage and drug supply  
billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country  
everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war "

-1,"i think maybe it's time for the batman series to be put to rest  
not only has the first two films' unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a "" superhero "" been abandoned , but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for all-out camp with few traces of the self-mocking restraint of the relatively light-hearted third installment  
let me give you an example : in the first scene of the movie , batman ( george clooney ) and robin ( chris o'donnell ) are summoned to a museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr  freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) in an attempt to steal a diamond  
mr  freeze's thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks , but this is no problem for our heroes : automatic skates shoot out of their shoes , at which point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick , grabs the diamond , and stick-handles it through the museum  
i might have expected this from an airplane-style farce , but i don't think that's what this movie is supposed to be  
after all , the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the superhero/action genre and kept the corny death-defying stunts to a minimum , while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony  
not any more ; the list goes on and on in this one "

-1,"synopsis : original "" jurassic park "" survivor alan grant ( neill ) is tricked by paul and amanda kirby ( macy and leoni ) into leading an expedition to an island overrun by dinosaur , to rescue their stranded son  
grant's team is picked off one by one as they encounter dinosaurs both new and familiar , and grant grows to realise that some breeds are more intelligent than he previously thought  
review : there is one reason why "" jurassic park iii "" is better than its immediate predecessor , "" the lost world : jurassic park ""  
the latter wasted 129 minutes of my life ; the former , only 94  
the first "" park "" was a marvellous film , full of awe-inspiring sights , interesting characters , and genuine thrills  
its two successors have been pale imitations , amounting to hundred-million-dollar b-grade horror movies  
at least this third entry realises it ; whereas "" the lost world "" tried to justify its existence with a ludicrous and overextended plot , "" jurassic park iii "" simply sticks its characters on an island with a bunch of dinosaurs and lets the mayhem begin  
there is a desperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie ; the computer-animated dinos are no longer novel or exciting , and even the first-time presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation  
remember that wondrous first trolley ride through the park in the original movie ? 
nothing in this rehash even comes close "
-1,"romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant  
with director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top-notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination  
those mentioned films , however , brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not : a solid , well-written screenplay  
call me cynical , but the jobs of writer and producer don't seem to mix well  
gary oldman plays jack grimaldi , a good cop turned bad , selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife  
his cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname , although the name doesn't provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character  
jack has become addicted to "" feeding the hole "" , a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money  
when he realizes his colleagues are being shot , he feebly attempts to get out  
gary oldman's performance is disappointingly weak ; he seems nearly bored "
-1,"stallone attempts to 'act' in this cop drama  
the film is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal , who's nephew ( played by michael rappaport ) is involved in a car crash and killing of two black youths  
keital dosen't really want to get involved in anything , gets rid of rappaport , and stallone and de niro try to work out what the hell is going on  
this film should be brilliant  
it sounds like a great plot , the actors are first grade , and the supporting cast is good aswell , and stallone is attempting to deliver a good performance  
however , it can't hold up  
although the acting is fantastic ( even stallone isn't bad ) the directing and story is dull and long winded 
some scenes go on for too long , with nothing really happening in them  
in fact , the only scenes that do work are action scenes , which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid  
in this film , serious means dull "
-1,"susan granger's review of "" america's sweethearts "" ( columbia/sony ) 
what a waste of a talented cast ! 
billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan have concocted a sly , provocative premise and , as the opening credits roll , it's obvious that they're attempting an old-fashioned romantic comedy  
the story involves a veteran publicist ( billy crystal ) who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director ( christopher walken ) holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room , refusing to show it to anyone  
he figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the film's once-married-but-now-estranged stars , gwen and eddie ( catherine zeta-jones , john cusack ) , they'll be so distracted that they won't remember they didn't see the movie or it wasn't what they expected  
 ( and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony critic/david manning quote scandal ! ) 
for help , he turns to gwen's personal assistant/sister ( julia roberts )  
but the laughs are few and far-between  
crystal's glib , cynical flack isn't wickedly funny enough with a few amusing one-liners  
after six months under the care of a depak chopra-like guru ( alan arkin ) , cusack's character's too emotionally fragile , lacking the necessary charisma  
zeta-jones's vain , narcissistic diva is undeveloped and one-dimensional  
only hank azaria , as zeta-jones's much-macho spanish lover , and stanley tucci , as a studio exec , and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth "
-1,"while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks  
and , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year  
the trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it's a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you've seen the animated series on hbo you'll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he's been sent to hell  
todd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else  
not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while  
every character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student  
the story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life  
al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d  b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him "

he finds a group of warriors mourning the loss of their king

a soothsayer says that thirteen warriors must answer the summons , twelve northmen and one outsider  
thus , ahmed becomes the "" 13th warrior  ""

most of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact , either good or bad , that in the end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings

i love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review  
the impression left by the film wasn't overwhelming - on the contrary , there were hardly any impression at all , since i had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it  
which surprise me to this day , because the movie theatre was full , i was close to sound speakers , the show wasn't late and i didn't lack sleep before the show  
such things happen very rarely to me , and , after many years , the closest thing to solution to this mystery is probably the quality of the film itself

-1,"at first glance , i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise  
its plotline goes like this : the evil king cromwell , desiring to take over the world , resurrects an evil , ancient sorceror , xusia for power  
he attacks the kingdom of eh-dan and kills young prince talon's parents  
given a triple-bladed sword ( which can shoot bad guys , like a gun ) by his dying father , talon vows for revenge

-1,"if you're debating whether or not to see _breakfast_of_champions_ , ask yourself one simple question : do you want to see nick nolte in lingerie ? 
the only people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolph's chaotic adaptation of the kurt vonnegut novel is the cross-section of the population with the unhealthy urge to see that unpleasant sight  
everyone else--and i'm hoping that's most people--would be wise to steer clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess  
actually , though , the sight of nolte in high heels is one of the more amusing things about this muddle , which focuses dwayne hoover ( bruce willis ) , the owner of dwayne hoover's exit 11 motor village in midland city  
not only is he a huge success as a businessman , he's also something of a celebrity , his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of television commercials  
with a nice home and family to boot , dwayne appears to have it all the ingredients to be happy--yet he's not  
his wife celia ( barbara hershey ) is perpetually in a pill-induced haze ; his son george ( lukas haas ) is a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage name "" bunny  "" 
not only that , the environmental protection agency is on dwayne's ass over a building development project  
it's enough to send dwayne on a nervous breakdown--that is , if he doesn't succeed in blowing his brains out first  
meanwhile , midland city is about to host a fine arts festival , and the guest of honor is one kilgore trout ( albert finney ) , a writer who is far from the renowned author the festival's organizer ( buck henry ) was led to believe--in fact , he's a penniless hack who writes second-rate sci-fi that appears in porn magazines "
-1,"a new entry in the "" revisionist history "" genre of filmmaking , dick suggests that two not-too-bright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nation's biggest presidential scandal  
kirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene , who while trying to deliver a fan letter from arlene's watergate hotel room , accidentally stumble across g  gordon liddy ( played dead-on by harry shearer ) and the infamous break-in  
when they recognize liddy later on during a white house field trip , they are ushered into a conference room , questioned as to what they know , and leave as official presidential dog walkers  
the girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties , but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with  
when they discover that nixon ( another dead-on performance by dan hedaya , who actually favors nixon slightly , unlike anthony hopkins ) has been abusive to checkers , the presidential dog , thanks to the conversations that he always recorded , they quit and become disillusioned  
during a prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein , events are set into motion that eventually lead to the president's resignation  
this film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry king-type talk show ( featuring a cameo by french stewart ) about revealing the identity of "" deep throat ""  
from there , we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad "" dick "" joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy "
-1,"depending on your degree of cinematic acumen , last man standing is either a ) a prohibition-era remake of akira kurosawa's 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition-era remake of sergio leone's 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition-era action drama with a completely original story-line  
new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined , much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons  
the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material , the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_  
it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself  
this time around , the man with no name is played by bruce willis , a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico

one is headed by an irishman named doyle ( david patrick kelly ) ; the other is run by chicago-connected italian mobster strozzi ( ned eisenberg )  
calling himself john smith , the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict , and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle's side

place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson , who wrote the film's pathetic screenplay

the plot is altogether implausible ; the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower , leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land

a truly profound statement , and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre ( just replace "" sex "" with "" your mad slasher film "" )  
for those uninformed souls , the mad slasher genre ( or sub-genre ) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline : a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween  
urban legend is a mad slasher flick , but one that is so sanitary , bloodless , and nudity free , that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful ( though not overly talented ) cast , it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special

how will loveless accomplish this ? 
well , by hulking around the desert in an enormous , mechanical tarantula , of course

if you have an answer , let me know  
foolish , the new movie written by and starring master p is a jaw-droppingly horrible film , one with no redeeming value socially , cinematically or otherwise  
comedically it has some potential , but only in its stand-up comedy moments , which i can turn on comedy central for  
master p stars as fifty dollah' ( beat that ! ) as a mobster ( i think ) who is trying to start a comedy club/act with his little brother foolish ( eddie griffin )  
but the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss ( played by andrew dice clay , for the very first time entertaining ) , a stubborn club owner and family problems ( the latter in foolish is a perfect example of roger ebert's "" idiot plot , "" if everyone here wasn't an idiot , there would be no problem ) 
so what does foolish have to offer beside a bunch of idiotic character names ? 
not a hell of a lot  
as i have mentioned , master p cannot act or write  
he acts like the rapper that he is  
the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced , as are his warm and fuzzy scenes with his little bro  
as for his script -- well , i suppose he delivers what one would expect from a musical artist with no previous screenwriting experience "

the iffiness in judge's plot -- a group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss -- is not in its appeal  
in fact , based on the popularity of scott adams' cartoon "" dilbert , "" which will soon have its own television series , a satirical view of the american workplace is a hot item in hollywood  
unfortunately the concept lends itself to skit-length sequences which would be more at home on the set of "" saturday night live "" rather than a full-length feature

-1," "" soldier "" , by director paul anderson , is a film in which any presence of originality is fleeting  
the best moments of the film are in the opning scenes where kurt russel's character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision  
brutality through the eyes of the innocent and stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has a lot of emotional potential power behind it , and the opening scenes tap into it a little  
then it goes nowhere with that idea  
there is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this dehumanization , and the rest of the film is just some of the biggest action movie cliches i've ever seen  
the whole idea of the inhuman , soldier-type character gaining some degree of humanity by defending a potential female love interest and family from his evil counterpart out to kill her is done , and it's been done much better  
i was able to predict the plot of the _whole_ story , which wouldn't be so bad if other aspect of the film somewhat interesting  
between the action sequences , it tries to deal with the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performance of mr  russel in the film and the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes , since his dialog is extremely limited "
-1,"the working title for no looking back was long time , nothing new , and rarely has there been a more apt name for a motion picture  
even though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes , it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics  
writer/director edward burns has trotted out a hackneyed storyline , the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasn't spent their life in seclusion  
instead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the proceedings , burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion , offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way  
no looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful  
the most appropriate ending would have been a triple suicide , and the sooner , the better  
alas , that's not the case , and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio  
and , to further depress audiences , burns has shot the entire film on cold , rainy days in a gray new york state beach town

with few exceptions , sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them , but the fact that "" species ii "" is a follow-up isn't the only reason it's so miserable  
it's the predictable storyline , the cardboard characters , the banal dialogue , the failed attempts at humor , the revolting special effects , the gratuitous nudity ( all female , of course ) , the bad acting , and the bland direction  
the plot , simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc , involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle

i suppose this film could have been watchable if it weren't for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing

-1,"studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it's a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring , cliched individual , not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn't be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio , which they did according to this film  
are we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly , that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it ?

this movie can't make up its mind  
is it a family comedy with vulgar references to both the male and female bodies , menstruation , circumcision , and sex that would make any parents squirm at the thought of having their child next to them ? 
or is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort ? 
either way , "" unbalanced "" is the word to stamp on this hit and miss and miss and miss effort

now it's time to show what he's achieved in those two years , and he has absolutely nothing to show for it

but his joan of arc is a mess , despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a close-cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself  
jovovich , besson's own personal muse through the making of his last two films ( though they've since separated ) , is magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible joan ( as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior , but also a fabulous , supermodel-level babe )  
and besson remains a servicable action film director , though not an especially facile one  
leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english , joan's struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring , and besson helps you understand how the french could believe , fervently , that god is on her side  
besson's big mistake , i think , is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject  
yes , joan had visions -- but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blue-eyed christ figure on display in besson's hallucinatory dream sequences

it basically involves how a bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways  
i'm not going into much greater detail than that , since it would take forever to explain , and quite frankly , i'm not willing to spend any more time on it than the 2 hours that i've already wasted  
while it tries very hard to be pulp fiction , 2 days in the valley falls way short  
this is quite a condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello , james spader and jeff daniels  
while the story isn't much , and the dialogue and characters rate only marginally better , 2 days in the valley does have a couple of bright spots  
james spader's character , while not much better than the rest , is at least fun to watch in a sick sort of way

-1,"would you believe -- in real life , i mean -- that if you were julia roberts , that you'd be the ugly underdog to your sister , the creepy catherine zeta-jones ?

reality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts , and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot  
that's reality  
america's sweethearts is the opposite of reality , a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also-ran , presumably because she wears horn-rimmed glasses and used to be overweight ( uh-huh )  
the plot follows two married , mega-movie stars , gwen and eddie ( zeta-jones and poor , poor john cusack , whose material gets worse every year ) , on the eve of their new star vehicle's release , a film called time over time  
the only problem : gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation , and the press and public have not been forgiving ( think meg and dennis )  
gosh , and the director has vanished with the film , holding the only print hostage  
veteran pr agent lee ( billy crystal ) is called upon to clean up the mess , throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie , presumably distracting the stupid , stupid film critics into forgetting they haven't seen the movie at all

-1," "" mercury rising "" has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary  
that's right  
the major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better  
this central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic  
his name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it  
simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him  
the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of "" mercury rising  "" 
i suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon's character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost  
miko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he's touched , and has a hard time looking at other people "

-1,"paul verhoeven , the dutch auteur who dragged his violent , sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film , has never been what i'd consider a thoughtful director ( though some of his films , notably starship troopers , have been lauded as artistic achievements ) , but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who's managed to , no matter what the budget , make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils  
starship troopers was essentially a b-monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange ( a great film that's nearly impossible to find on video , yet showgirls is everywhere ) , in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ; the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards ( who may actually be 45% silicone ) , in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage  
it's not a completely successful film , but as a failure it's certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining ) one  
my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores ; spetters , a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange ( haven't yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight )  
i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop , a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic hero that's as touching as schwarzenegger's in t2  
that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics  
its violence seemed to be there for a purpose , namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread , not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience  
there's a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him

with a total of 4 decent films , it's not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing  
with that said , you can pretty much predict what my opinion on "" the 13th warrior "" will be  
the film is based on the michael crichton "" eaters of the dead "" , in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king

-1,"weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg's reliance on formulas , _saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches  
there ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics  
spielberg's greatest strength as a director is the polished , formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story  
but for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war ( or the holocaust ) this technique backfires , for it creates coherent , comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size , complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken  
in this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films

porter is not dead , however---not by a long shot---as he quickly rehabilitates and , along with his loyal prositute girlfriend , rosie ( maria bello ) , sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay

-1,"salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets  
actors who demand such salaries might be greedy , but in some instances they are quite justified , because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation  
proof for that can be found even in the realm of low-budget movies , and one fine example is breakaway , 1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring ( in ) famous figure skater tonya harding

the result should have been more interesting than "" the cell  "" 
as the movie opens , therapist catharine deane ( jennifer lopez ) treats a catatonic boy ( colton james ) by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique that's never fully explained  
after months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert , catharine has no success to report  
meanwhile , killer carl stargher ( vincent d'onofrio ) has claimed another victim  
his particular hobby is to kidnap young women , keep them in a glass cell overnight , and drown them  
he takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach , then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning  
although carl's been doing this for awhile , he's recently become sloppy , and fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) is closing in fast  
not fast enough , though , to keep carl from sticking another woman ( tara subkoff ) in the cell or to catch him before he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him in a coma "

the fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesn't exactly hurt it either

this time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen , and close's facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year-old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers  
but that's only half the problem with kevin lima's laborious film  
what makes "" 102 dalmatians "" such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he's a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic "" heroes "" of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander-than-bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ?

this is a dreadful motion picture ? a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio  
there's a kind of desperation in the movie's approach to humor that reveals the film makers' uncertainty about how entertaining the material is ; the manic style betrays itself as a last-ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script  
the premise doesn't sound especially amusing to begin with ? almost heroes tells the tale of two explorers , the effeminate leslie edwards ( matthew perry ) and the uncouth bartholomew hunt ( chris farley ) , who are racing lewis and clark on the trip to the american northwest  
edwards and hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies ( albeit of the early-19th century variety ) , including a frenchman named guy fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages ( none of which prove to be useful ) , a pretty indian maiden who turns into the obligatory love interest , and a bizarre man who suffers a series of debilitating injuries

reviewed by dennis schwartz 
a black comedy set in the near future in a boarding house run by a depraved butcher  
the comedy is played more in comic strip style for entertaining value than for deeper satire , as it features mostly zany sophomoric sight gags and relies heavily on special effects  
the world has fallen on hard times and there are food shortages which include no meat , so the butcher serves up meat from human flesh to customers who pay with grain , almost as valued a commodity  
that's the big joke in the film and the novelty of that cannibalism idea wears thin mighty fast , as the characters are too absurd and sketched too thinly for us to care about them  
this tasteless postapocalyptic french comedy is a first feature for the co-directors marc caro/jean-pierre jeunet  
it failed to reach my funny bone and instead left me mostly annoyed at its slight story and its dark projections for the future  
an ex-circus clown named louison ( dominique pinon ) , the film's too-good-to-be-true hero , answers an ad for work as a handyman for clapet ( jean-claude dreyfus ) , and the butcher and landlord , offers him room and board in his house  
the butcher's clumsy and near-sighted daughter julie ( marie-laure dougnac ) falls in love with the skinny , weird looking clown , and the two make some music together , with her playing the cello and him a saw  
they are the innocents , surrounded by a boarding house of misfits suffering from fear and watched over by her overbearing father , who has lured into his tenement the clown , as he has his past innocent victims , so that he can put his cleaver to him and then sell him as meat , which he intends to do as soon as the clown fixes up the tenement "

of all the non-criminal possibilities brought about by rendering oneself invisible , in "" hollow man "" kevin bacon's character opts to commit sex crimes  
er , it's kevin bacon who plays the super smart military bio-molecular research scientist ? 
something sounds horribly wrong already

 "" hollow man "" features a string of hapless , c-list actors ( among them bacon , elisabeth shue , josh brolin , and kim dickens ) in a grade-z plot with a lot of special effects that , frankly , don't look much better than those used in the 1933 version of "" the invisible man  "" 
oh bacon glistens when he gets wet all right and looks like a rather fatty side of cheap flank steak when he's attempting reentry but otherwise it's lots of "" thermal "" shots and inanimate objects ( elisabeth shue included ) bobbing around without any visible signs of support  
since invisibility , once achieved , isn't much of an effect ( the actors spend half their time conversing with nobody and the other half of their time talking to each other--it amounts to much of a muchness ) , the director elects to wardrobe all of his female protagonists in loosely-buttoned sweaters so that the minute bacon's character gets invisible he can head straight for them  
it's as if that fascinating concept--what would you do if no one could see you ? --is 
simply a verhoeven ploy to show some skin "

the family at the center of _polish_wedding_ is the pzoniaks , which consists of mother jadzia ( lena olin ) , father bolek ( gabriel byrne ) , sole daughter hala ( claire danes ) and four sons of varying degrees of facelessness  
it's a large family , but there's not a sympathetic one in the whole bunch , certainly not in the primary trio

-1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species  
squandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley's a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain't )  
miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they'd dare tempt fate and go for another round  
so here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid  
the film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can

the premise of , "" the butcher boy , "" is one that could have very well been turned into a thought-provoking , disturbing motion picture , but somehow nothing works

i didn't see the first film until much later  
so looking back , the original didn't hold a lot of great memories for me , since i didn't think too much of it when i initially saw it  
watching it now for a second time confirmed that it's an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever  
you all know the story by now : child murderer freddy krueger ( robert englund ) returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before  
this first installment does an adequate job with it's low budget , but there's some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story  
plus the movie's ending ( understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a "" hook "" for a sequel ) renders the rest of the film pointless

this is another "" scream "" -like feature , consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip-offs from the most pointless movies of all time  
amy ( jennifer morrison ) is a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have a clue about what to do  
but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious university's film program -- where each year's best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize , a virtual one-way ticket to hollywood success -- she has a chance encounter with campus security guard reese ( loretta devine ) , whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a fictional thriller organized along similar lines  
soon enough , fake -- and real -- blood starts to flow , and amy is being chased around by scary killer , while her cast and crew get slain , one by one  
is the culprit the original urban legends murderer , just some random psycho , ! 
a member of the faculty , one of her competitors for the hitchcock , or is there something even more stupid going on ?

degeneres is horrible and her character is even worse , a tough-talking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair

it was a dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the film's director could negotiate  
but he seems to be trying and that shouldn't be overlooked ( or probably over praised ) seeing as how , at this point , he really isn't required to do much but look pretty

it's tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass , but his performance actually helps with the illusion  
unlike ben affleck's puppy dog approach in reindeer games , phillippe is believable and not too bad at that  
as for the plot , well , that's one of the bad surprises ; phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic ( and not even remotely likeable ) criminals ( introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people ) who hatch a scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother ( juliette lewis ) after overhearing that she's carrying the baby of painter ( scott wilson ) , a very well connected wealthy man "

or law in "" albino alligator "" --tough , gruff , and little bit scarier  
or colonel william sharp in "" armageddon , "" or dwayne engelman in "" strange days , "" or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of "" pearl harbor , "" as the abusive father of danny--here is an actor who gravitates towards tough , gruff , hard-hitting roles

-1,"if there's one thing i just can't stand , it's a film that oozes with sentimentality  
here's a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves  
swelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless  
alas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up  
what reminded me was that i wasn't choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter  
my giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un-cute ( i detest the word "" cute "" but i've chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a "" cute "" film here )  
it takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience

the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities

on paper , this shouldn't have been so terrible -- it had a talented director in agnieszka holland ( "" the secret garden "" ) , a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton ( dangerous liaisons ) , and a capable cast  
but the film was done in by its inept script , the unappealing way the film was directed , and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud  
i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film , with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius , spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade  
he , especially , looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be  
but when the two of them were together , it looked like a mismatch

first we meet one of the villains , then the soon-to-be heroine , a child prodigy , a wacky inventor , and a group of primitive people that somehow have some of the technology we have today , but also some of the low-tech tools used by pirates and vikings

however , their idyllic world begins to crumble upon the arrival of mr jones ( sam neil ) , martin ricardo ( rufus sewell ) and their servant , pedro ( graziano marcelli ) , who have come to steal heyst's rumoured plunder  
while the novel is largely complex in characterization , the film sadly transposes conrad's characters into lacklustre leads , the most disappointing being heyst himself  
conrad's heyst adheres religiously to his late father's ways of detachment and isolation  
his ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma , a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice  
the struggle to embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude , however , is lost in mark peploe's ( director and writer ) diluted version of heyst  
without properly establishing the crucial details of heyst's character , all that is left of conrad's main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment and human involvement  
on the one hand , actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task ( though not impossible ) , but on the other hand , dafoe's flat acting cannot be excused as an attempt at stoicism

comments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video  
their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they're typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television )  
stalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he's rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband )

comments : tracks of a killer had a couple of strikes against it before i even began watching it  
strike one was the fact that someone had scrawled the word garbage on the videotape's sticker in black marker ( not typically a good sign when you rent a film )  
strike two came while the previews played  
did you ever get a sinking premonition about a movie's quality ( or lack thereof ) while watching the trailers that come before it ? 
well , the cheesy films being advertised before tracks of a killer were films that no one has ever heard of starring people no one knows , and they all looked bad ( definately not a good sign )  
tracks of a killer itself completed the strikeout  
about the only positive thing this film had going for it was the fact that it sports some nice scenery  
to be fair , the first half-hour or so promises at least a watchable thriller  
wolf larson , who bears more than a passing resemblance to hugh grant , adequately plays the underling obviously set up as the killer of the film's title "

however , like the golden child , although blair witch has made a lot of money , it's not very good  
donahue , williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the blair witch myth  
the film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded , which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles  
although events start of normal , they get weird pretty quickly , while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on  
although an interesting premise , the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity  
the biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise  
most of the dialogue is ad-libbed , and still manages to sound like a poor b-movie

-1,"this is the last carry on film with its almost intact regular cast and it is the swansong of hattie jacques and sid james  
dick turpin ( sid james ) and his gang which includes harriett/harry ( barbara windsor ) and tom "" doc "" scholl ( peter butterworth ) , terrorise the countryside by staging highway robberies : "" stand and deliver ! "" 
owing to the increased occurrence of turpin's robberies , captain desmond fancey of the bow street runners ( kenneth williams ) and his sidekick sergeant jock strapp ( jack douglas ) visit turpin's area of influence to bring him to justice  
they are under the express orders of sir roger daley ( bernard bresslaw )  
their intellect does not count for much and when they increasingly become suspicious of reverend flasher aka dick turpin ( sid james ) , whom they confided in earlier , they still cannot believe that the rector has any part in these robberies  
however , once they catch harriett and put her in jail , and sir roger daley takes complete charge , it seems that there is no hope for dick turpin  
then again , sir roger has assigned the dimwits fancey and jock strapp aswell as the old dithering constable ( kenneth connor ) to keep an eye on their prisoner ! 
there is no doubt that this is a 'sid james' carry on movie  
he excels in double roles ( as in 'carry on- don't lose your head' ) and his performance as flasher and turpin is hilarious  
barbara windsor is also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid and member of the gang , and hattie jacques' small but effective role as the rector's housekeeper martha hoggett is played to perfection  
jack douglas plays a milder version of his excruciatingly annoying on-screen persona and kenneth williams is given a rather mundane part "

i suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill ( 48 hours ) removed his name from the movie , requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee

he is also an excellent judge of character , knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witness's testimony  
and , on top of that , he's a damn good trial lawyer  
in the opening scene , it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty , but it doesn't hamper lomax's desire to creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt , thereby getting an acquittal

review : given the absurdism of its would-be plot , it's unlikely that "" original sin "" could have been turned into a reputable piece of filmmaking , regardless of writer , director or stars  
this is , at its heart , b-movie junk : a lurid melodrama which appeals to neither the brain nor the heart but to the nether regions  
that said , "" original sin "" could at least have become enjoyable junk had the filmmakers embraced its trashiness and indulged in it  
instead , cristofer seems to have mistaken this for a serious production , and directs it as such  
the result is a vapid , uninteresting morass of obvious crosses and double crosses , as likely to incite a yawn as a thrill

-1," ( dreamworks skg ) running time : 2 hours starring robert duvall , tea leoni and elijah wood directed by mimi leder the first of the two asteroid movies coming out this year ( the second is the macho armageddon ) is actually a dull affair  
elijah wood plays leo biederman , who during astronomy class discovers that a large asteroid is heading for earth  
tea leoni plays a ( rather crap ) news reporter , jenny lerner , who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded and boring way , and robert duvall plays the leader of a space crew , spurgeon tanner , who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth  
also featuring is morgan freeman as the president , and maximilian schell and vanessa redgrave as jenny's father and mother  
while many people will walk into the film expecting a big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up ( as the trailers seem to promise ) , the film is actually more of a character study , if a very poor one  
the main problem is that there are too many characters in the film , and not enough time to explore them all  
only the space crew are given any depth , jenny lerner , leo and the president are surprisingly 2d , and we never get to know these characters

after all , it's not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments , but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry

but , hell , it's not as if he's the only problem in this well-intentioned but ultimately below average aussie thriller  
leads , race and samantha press are wooden and dull , hampered by some unfortunate attempts at sexy dialogue early on  
though they do manage some heat later in their love scenes , helped , no doubt by them keeping their mouths shut

-1,"according to hitchcock and various other filmmakers , isolated motels , diners , gas stations and similar establishments in american southwest can be rather dangerous place for weary travellers  
at the beginning of eye of the storm , 1991 german- american thriller directed by yuri zeltser , one of such places becomes deadly for their owners who get murdered during the stick up  
ten years later their son steven ( played by bradley gregg ) , who was blinded during the incident , still runs motel together with his older brother ray ( played by craig sheffer )  
hardly anything happens there until alcoholic and abusive william gladstone ( played by dennis hopper ) gets stranded there with his attractive wife sandra ( played by lara flynn boyle )  
their unexpected presence creates the chain of the events that would end in bloodshed  
yuri zeltser , author of this film , was obviously inspired by hitchcock's psycho , but he chose to add some new and potentially interesting elements to the original plot  
instead of norman bates we have two brothers - one of them traumatised physically , another mentally  
sexual tension between beautiful female patron and shy motel clerk is heightened with the presence of alcoholic husband  
eye of the storm is impressive in visual sense , with photography by karl walter lindenlaub providing a lot of claustrophobic atmosphere "

thus sometimes , films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations  
last year it was the thin red line  
this year's "" winner "" is the hurricane , pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool  
acclaimed director norman jewison's biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun

it's about rubin "" hurricane "" carter ( denzel washington ) , a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly ( racist ! ) 
detective ( dan hedaya ) who's had it in for the "" big-shot "" hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife ( in self-defense but who cares , right ? )

-1,"the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john maybury's love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon  
as always , jacobi's acting is impeccable , but the movie tries hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque  
the movie convincingly argues that francis , played by jacobi , was a completely despicable and vain individual , but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude  
when interviewed by a fawning talk show host , francis calls his style "" chance brushstrokes  "" 
starting with a burglary of francis's flat , the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie  
the camera shots are heavy on the avant-garde angles -- lots of wide-angle close-ups and distorted shots filmed through colored-glass reflections  
the director is much more interested in filmmaking style than in the substance of the story with the result being a sterile examination of a lonely and vain man  
daniel craig , in a lifeless performance , plays the burglar and boxer , george dyer  
when francis lays eyes on him after the break-in , francis promises not to call the police if he'll stay for sex "

though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare's 'romeo and juliet' , its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york , is very hard to associate with shakespeare's poetry

van damme #1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives  
van damme #2 is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after #1 gets killed in france  
the remaining twin ( the french cop ) goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death  
once there , he hooks up with his deceased brother's girlfriend , played by natasha henstridge , and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are

-1,"the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes  
alas , it refers to our heroes ! 
as it turns out , the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth ( via the mir space station ) thinks of the human race as a virus -- perhaps even a cancer -- that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further  
after all , we have taken up this entire planet , and if they let us live for another billion years or so , we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one

-1,"an affluent horse breeder's past comes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices  
that's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow  
that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source  
the acting in particular i found very good , the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie  
a few things about the story didn't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone , yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better  
on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i found to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot  
the character's aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing  
as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener  
all these people acted their parts admirably , as for the part that sharon stone played , she played it well but the part was not utilized enough "

-1,"when a pair of films from the same director gets released just three weeks apart , it could mean one of two things : that the recently overworked individual is due for a well-deserved rest , or that either of these movies has been sitting in a studio safe for a while and the timing is merely a coincidence  
the latter's the case with john mctiernan and "" the thirteenth warrior , "" which finally hits theatres a year and counting after its original spring '98 opening - and fast on the heels of mctiernan's "" the thomas crown affair "" remake , a flick that got good reviews  
you don't have to believe superstitions to wager a guess that "" thirteenth "" won't be so lucky  
reportedly shelved following skirmishes between mctiernan and producer michael crichton , whose "" eaters of the dead "" novel provides "" warrior "" 's source ( and its initial title ) , this messy melange of culture-clash drama and brutal warfare feels empty and sluggish - sorta like "" braveheart "" without any of the passion  
but the bloodshed certainly remains : there's enough carnage on display here to satisfy those in search of purely visceral thrills , though please note that the admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death and dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable in their dullness  
these circa-10th century clashes involve a roving band of cannibalistic creatures capable of decapitating opponents with their bare hands and a dozen norse soldiers out to stop them from terrorizing the viking countryside  
the good guys are loud , crude , often unintelligible and - judging from their highly icky hygiene habits -- pretty smelly to boot , which makes them perfect foils for the dignified arab ambassador ( antonio banderas ) who tags along quite reluctantly  
they're also so hard to tell apart that it hardly matters when a few of them meet violent demises  
you'll wince , you'll groan , you'll grouse , "" haven't we seen this guy killed twice before ? ""

-1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
it's rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylor's first feature film , dream with the fishes , when the plodding , tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup  
any hopeful expectations , however , are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatched-buddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the film's latter half  
the film's central characters are terry ( david arquette ) , a depressed , lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident , and nick ( brad hunt ) , a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill  
nick lives in the apartment building across from terry , who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz ( kathryn erbe ) with his trusty set of binoculars , but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a half-drunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge , unconvincingly vowing suicide  
nick casually asks for terry's wristwatch , and eventually cons terry into a trade - the watch for a bottle of pills  
of course , terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects , and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch  
learning of nick's condition ( he only has a handful of weeks left ) , terry's compassion kicks in , and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement - terry will agree to bankroll the dying nick's lifelong fantasies , and nick will fulfill terry's death wish by killing him "

a sloppy version of almost stream of conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of the illusion of sex , drugs , and disco  
the narrator , shane o'shae ( ryan phillippe ) , works as a grease monkey in new jersey who , of course , on a whim decides to go into new york and try to get into studio "" 54 ""  
phillippe gives a passable performance which could have been made by any young , attractive actor with a six pack stomach

-1," "" desperate measures "" is a generic title for a film that's beyond generic  
it's also a depressing waste of talent , with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles , not to mention once-cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not-cool flicks -- this thriller is more "" before and after "" than "" reversal of fortune  "" 
the movie is a big disappointment , and yet it's somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it -- the premise is both promising and intriguing  
too bad the execution's all wrong , though , because the set-up of "" desperate measures "" boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use  
san francisco cop frank connor ( garcia ) is a single parent with a troubling dilemma -- his son matt ( joseph cross ) is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission  
even worse , the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe ( michael keaton ) , currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society  
connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery ; he's at first reluctant , but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital  
when he does make a run for it , connor offers close pursuit , but for different reasons than his superiors ( including the crusty brian cox ) -- they want to take mccabe down , while connor needs to keep him alive , or all hope is lost for his little boy  
one misstep "" desperate measures "" makes is in its underdevelopment of matt's illness "

already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect -- the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless she's under thirty ( or at least looks it ) , and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men  
what's worse is that the movie confirms all the above , and wallows in them as well

i've always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid  
dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded ; you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are , no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat , and no idea how long the ride will last  
then there's the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine-laced dose  
mushrooms , on the other hand , offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel : a steady , reassuring assent , a short period of thrilling motion and color , and then a smooth landing  
acid is for daredevils ; mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy  
my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas , director terry gilliam has made an acid movie , when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie  
full of shocking sight gags , aggressive images and grotesque comic performances , the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s  thompson's book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world-view from the inside out

which wasn't so hard to expect , because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies  
in such times , when political involvement could be associated with noble passion , many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of pre-war europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany

no such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron's wing for years and years , i'm beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him  
in fact , "" virus "" should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like "" virus "" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget

for his fifth collaboration with director rich- ard donner ( lethal weapon i-iii , maverick ) , mel gibson plays a motormouth , maybe mentally ill new york city cabbie , jerry , whose wild conspiracy theories are all but ignored by alice ( julia roberts , acting all serious ) , the justice department employee that he has a crush on  
she not interested , but another person is : a cia psychiatrist ( patrick stewart ) who promptly kidnaps him  
is one of jerry's conjectures correct ? 
 * is * the metal strip in the new $100 bill being used to track your movements ? 
is oliver stone still alive , because he cut a deal with george bush to spread * dis * information ? 
is this movie really about * any * of the crazed cabbie's theories ? 
no , no , and no  
as it turns out , there's some other nonsense going on here , involving and revolving around jerry's background  
 ( hint : pay attention to an early scene where jerry blacks out and flashes back , in quick succession , to images of an interrogation room , hypodermic needles , and ms  roberts herself  ) 
the * initial * premise is pretty good and is played , for a while , at a delightfully dizzying clip  
mel is wider-open that we've ever seen him and , if his character's relationship with roberts' initially strains credibility , their combined star power is blissfully intoxicating

-1,"one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often-acclaimed director sidney lumet's "" gloria , "" a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film , had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre  
suddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in  
when a movie is over , aren't we supposed to think about it for a while , and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ? 
i thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and #2 , even if i had been with someone there wouldn't have been anything to talk about in the first place  
to be sure , "" gloria "" begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven-year-old boy's family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it  
right before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with  
eventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean-luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment  
meanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn't commit and returns to her ex-boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime  
when he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude

a film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson 
i once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as "" dim-witted ""  
and by golly , just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead  
although the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career , this is not one of them  
two points in the movie's favour - the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi - keep things from falling totally into the abyss , but by and large city of the living dead is a failure  
and like most cinematic failures , it comes down to bad writing , dumb performances and lousy direction  
the story starts in new york when , during a seance , a medium ( katherine mccoll ) sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich , massachusetts  
for reasons we won't go into here , this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth  
the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance , but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist ( christopher george )  
that scene in itself is a howler : why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside ?

anyway , off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world , where various grisly goings-on are already happening as all saints day approaches "

if there is a movie theater in hell , this film is playing there 24 hours a day  
the story , such that there is , revolves around todd ( kurt russell ) , an automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be a merciless soldier in a not-too-distant ultra-conservative future ( is there any other kind ? ) 
after years of desensitization at a military academy full of other boys just like him , todd becomes a ground fighter in a series of wars all over the galaxy  
who the enemies in these wars are is never revealed , but the few glimpses of todd in battle show that it doesn't matter , because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys  
after ten minutes of this nihilistic trash -- yes folks , there's more -- we see todd as a buff , scarred adult , now so accustomed to the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat  
there's a new wrinkle , though  
todd and his brethren are declared obsolete , and a new batch of soldiers takes their place  
after losing a sanctioned battle with _dragon_'s jason scott lee , the seemingly dead todd is dumped by a flying ice-cube tray ( well , that's what is looked like ) on a remote garbage planet "

 "" quick , robin !

- adam west in the 1966 batman feature film , casually kicking at a pathetic-looking rubber shark attached to his leg 
i had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness , but in many instances batman and robin nears , and at some point even exceeds this standard  
this is a disasterously bad film , easily the worst in the series to date , and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive - it's loud , garish , and obnoxious , with pointless , gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill  
batman and robin features the caped crusaders ( george clooney debuting as batman , with chris o'donnell returing as robin ) squaring off against another bevy of chemically-induced villains - the nefarious ice-cold mr  freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) , armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights , and the slinky poison ivy ( uma thurman ) , who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her ( not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result , but whatever ) , and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss  
by ivy's side is the giant steroid monster bane ( jeep swanson ) , a grunting hulk of a beast  
the villains' goals are noble ones - freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit ( in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees ) , so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife ( vendela ) , dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation , and ivy's intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth , albeit by destroying all human life  
meanwhile , on the homefront , life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth ( michael gough ) , and the arrival of his niece barbara ( alicia silverstone ) "
-1,"when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects  
while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don't think that they are completely to blame for this movie's failure  
it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the "" unseen "" terrors , and it was about as scary as a dust bunny  
so special effects or not , if the story isn't the least bit scary , you aren't going to end up with a very frightening movie

dern is always great , and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie

-1," "" deep rising "" gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively : not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squid-like menace , but the unfolding story is artificial , silly and almost completely derivative of countless other ( and , for the most part , better ) films  
while dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures -- take , for example , the schlocky mountain highs of last spring's "" anaconda "" -- "" deep rising "" has no tongue to put in its cheek  
folks , we're only a month into the new year , and already here's a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases  
most of the action takes place on the argonautica , a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage ( uh-oh -- if these people had seen "" titanic , "" then maybe they'd have known to stay home ) when it's attacked by a giant , tentacled sea creature  
the only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian ( famke janssen ) , argonautica owner canton ( anthony heald ) and a few other crew members  
a mercenary team , lead by resourceful captain john finnegan ( treat williams ) , board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby  
but what their search of the ship uncovers is something blood-soaked , hungry and not very helpful  
the main problem with "" deep rising "" is its overt familiarity ; the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci-fi/horror films in recent memory

the film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen ? lope cruz , who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations , the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot , but who can't get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story  
pen ? lope was wonderful in pedro almod ? var's "" all about my mother , "" but here she is so visible in such a stale story , where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking , that she somehow looks ridiculous , as if she got egg all over her face  
the best you can say about her , is that she's not to blame for this picture being so off  
this exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex , is in my opinion , worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will  
the story is all about the love , motion sickness , and cooking ability of isabella ( cruz ) , who is born in bahia , brazil and learns to cook at an early age from her parents' cook  
to cure her motion sickness , her parents tried every remedy , until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sea for her cure  
she is able to control it now as long as she doesn't drive a car , ride elevators , follow in dancing , and is the woman on top when making love "
-1,"it's almost amusing to watch 21-year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potter's follow-up to 1997's the tango lesson , the man who cried  
the gen-y actress , with her cold stare and big , black eyes , has appeared in an impressive range of films ; but she doesn't even come close to being the bold heroine the film , set against the historical backdrop of world war 2 , requires her to be  
ricci , whose character is shockingly silent and blank , showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern , shares most of her scenes with the astounding cate blanchett : quite an amusing sight to behold  
blanchett's lola , a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie , is bold , interesting and layered ? everything our heroine lacks  
co-star of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy , blanchett has a good seven inches on ricci , sports twice the makeup and dons a flashy wardrobe  
the actress inhabits the role ? as she always so remarkably does ? with a fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the film's lead rather than her dull companion  
important historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the film ; these landmarks serve as the film's little conflict  
obviously , the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events , whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian colleagues

simmer for 100 minutes  
yields : zilch  
the phantom is a depressing and tired retread of so many earlier , better movies that after the fifteen-minute mark i started cataloguing them out loud  
it's hard to make a good action-adventure movie that doesn't simply recycle its predecessors , and i've seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully  
the phantom , allegedly based on the long-running comic of the same name , doesn't even bother to be graceful  
it's a stupid and incompetent movie in too many ways to list , but i'll try  
the film opens up with a "" prelude "" sequence that looks like it was slashed to ribbons in the editing and then given a heavy voice-over to compensate for whatever got thrown out  
we go from there to a jungle sequence that , i swear to god , recycles the truck-chase scene from raiders of the lost ark note-for-note , possibly even shot-for-shot , right down to the moment where indy wrenched open the door and slung one of the drivers out into the brush -- and then goes on to rip off the rope-bridge scene from "" sorcerer "" as well !

-1," "" the animal "" is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along , generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling

there are certainly better things you can do with your time  
actually , if you've seen the trailer , then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments  
the story centers on bland marvin ( rob schneider ) , who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer  
but he's afflicted with loser-itis  
dogs attack him , neighbors torment him , children bully him , and his co-workers ignore him  
truthfully , with his bad haircut ( seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic , little richard , and giant poodles ) and his unenthusiastic demeanor , we'd probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun

taiwan , 24/12/99  
the millenium approaches  
an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city  
sectors of the city are being sealed , quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus  
the virus causes people to act like insects : they crawl about on all fours , hide from bright lights , huddle in damp corners  
the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a week's time  
residents are advised to evacuate the area , asap

prior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989's "" leviathan , "" 1989's "" deep star six , "" and all four "" alien "" pictures  
 "" virus , "" in comparison , is a servicable thriller , well-made and produced , but since it doesn't include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence , it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on  
based on a series of comic books , "" virus "" concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat , which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon  
after discovering that the boat is slowly sinking , ( un ) lucky for them , a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen  
once the team reaches the russian ship , they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted  
after turning the power back on , however , there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship , and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself  
one survivor finally does turn up , nadia ( joanna pacula ) , who informs the suicidal and stern captain ( donald sutherland ) and one of the crew , kit foster ( jamie lee curtis ) , that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship , taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out "

that is enough action to last us a while and we could , director john carpenter would let us , get to a story line  
but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene

the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end  
and that is something of a pity because the film , based on the book vampire$ by john steakley , gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery  
this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film , but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it "

not that cindy does that bad , it's just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy's extraordinary acting skills , but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation  
and in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty , but i'm sure that that is just a coincidence , no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet , well , that's just a happy coincidence

the drawing room farce of the 30's dealt with sexual innuendo and relied on wit and a great deal of commotion and noise to place the viewer in the thick of the duplicitous romantic action  
back then , impossibly wealthy scions of society , with too much free time , would get themselves wrapped up in all sorts of sexual peccadilloes with spouses and lovers , only to have everything come out all right in the end - see "" the philadelphia story "" for a great farce  
 "" town & country "" has the impossibly wealthy protagonists with too much free time - the kind of people that have jobs but never seem to work - and sexual misconduct on several levels  
but , there is almost no life to original script by michael laughlin and buck henry and this is "" t&c's "" downfall  
there is , obviously , a great deal of hollywood talent , in front of and behind the camera , involved in "" town & country , "" but , without a likable or , at least , interesting story to carry through their efforts , it is all for naught  
and , that's what we get here - naught

-1,"late in down to you , the lead female character ( julia stiles ) states her greatest fear is having an "" artificial conversation "" with her boyfriend ( freddie prinze jr  )  
the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out , fallen asleep , or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy  
the film is a multi-million dollar testament to everything artificial  
filled with characters , motivation , plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster  
prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles' freshman co-ed  
at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out-doing the previous in how "" cute "" it can be  
the happy couple "" psychoanalyze "" each other ; they pick out a song because , as prinze's dj mother ( lucie arnez ) explains , every couple needs a song ; he smells her shampoo ; she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love  
then , in standard romantic comedy style , things fall apart "

comments : when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics ( where he had made a name for himself as a first-rate comic book penciller on the "" spider-man "" titles ) to join the newly-formed , creator-owned image comics , a new comic book legend was born : spawn  
mcfarlane's "" spawn "" immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s  
mcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate , allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max  
the early "" spawn "" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane's genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing  
with the popularity of "" spawn "" and the success of the current warner bros  's batman film franchise , a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn "
-1,"the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits

such is the case for the 1990 paul mayersberg film _the last samurai_  
though the blurb alludes to "" a jungle filled with political intrigue , uneasy alliances , and murderous enemies at every turn , "" the story of the movie is actually quite simple ( and prosaic ) : a middle-aged japanese businessman named endo ( played by john fujioka ) and his assistant , both of whom have samurai aspirations , travel to africa in search of his ancestor , who went to bring buddhism to africa  
he hires the services of down-at-the-heels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo ( the redoubtable lance henriksen ) and his girlfriend ( arabella holzbog ) , and travels to the camp of an arms-merchant-cum-safari-host- cum-islamic-missionary ( john saxon ) and his wife ( lisa eilbacher )

-1,"it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of todays movies or novels , you must suspend disbelief   
however , there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies  
it came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg , indiana ( where the film is set ) , does not have a mcdonald's , a sears store , a statue of a man on a horse , nor even a dam close by  
even if you can ignore these somewhat white lies ( even though the dam is crucial to hard rains plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just dont gel  
firstly , morgan freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such films as driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption and se7en ) , was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement  
he _should_ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman  
as a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg , its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases  
i say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems a tad strange that an entire town ( with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way ) can vanish before the flood has actually started

caddyshack , as the name implies , more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club  
michael o'keefe plays said caddy  
why they cast this unknown , fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me  
the movie doesn't seem to have a real plot , just a series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera  
the only real story , if you can call it that , was a subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper , bill murray , who is having his own private little war against a gopher who is ruining the course "
-1,"any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project , as a perfect murder illustrates  
frankly , dial m for murder is not one of the master director's greatest efforts , so there is ample room for improvement  
unfortunately , instead of updating the script , ironing out some of the faults , and speeding up the pace a little , a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder , leaving behind the nearly- unwatchable wreckage of a would-be '90s thriller  
almost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities  
the best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what's going on so that these flaws in logic don't become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled  
unfortunately , in a perfect murder , the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they're happening  
this is a very bad sign  
not only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief , but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder  
of course , in the case of a perfect murder , at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless , cardboard characters "

in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry  
toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart

-1,"back in 1980s , chuck norris used to be synonym for the action films  
he couldn't , of course , top the success and fame of big action names like sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger , but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shoot'em up and beat'em up genre aficionados  
that quantity was mostly provided by cannon group , prolific production company that dominated the b-movie market in previous decade by flooding it with cheap , formulaic and , more often than not , unwatchable genre products  
the hitman , 1991 action thriller directed by chuck's brother aaron , is one of the last among them  
chuck norris here plays seattle cop betrayed , shot and left for dead by his partner ( which shouldn't surprise anyone , considering the fact that the partner is being played by michael parks , specialised for roles of usually very mean characters )  
surviving the shooting , cop is pronounced dead and hired as deep undercover agent  
he infiltrates the underworld circles in seattle and becomes their top hitman , using his abilities to start brutal war between three major crime organisations - italians , french canadians and iranians

-1,"can a horror movie truly be called a horror movie if it has no scares , suspense , or even eerie elements ? 
i think not , but that's what children of the corn 666 : issac's return wants us to believe  
the sixth installment in the horrible , worn out series is by far the worst to date  
unlike the other five chapters , children of the corn 666 is a confusing , brainless thriller that takes the psychological horror route rather than slasher horror , but either way , none of these movies are the least bit scary  
the film follows hannah ( natalie ramsey ) a teen looking for her mother in gatlin , nebraska , on the eve of her 21st birthday  
what starts out as a daughter in desperate search of her long lost mother turns into the story of hannah being the first daughter of the children of the corn , who roam the cornfields looking for adults to murder  
that's about all that's understandable in the film , as after we learn this much , issac ( john franklin ) who led the children of the corn in a previous chapter , now an older , strange man , is looking for hannah to fulfill his prophecy  
and this is supposed to make sense  
really  
from the start the film is unclear of where its going , not developing any characters or throwing any concrete plot details across the table , constantly introducing new characters without personalities or the slightest hint of an individuality , and sub plots that have nothing to do with what seems to the main focus of the film "

as a morgue attendant sets about removing the bullets from porter's back , porter miraculously springs back to life  
he makes it his mission , as a walking dead man without a conscience , to exact revenge on those who screwed him and reclaim his share of the loot  
 ( in a running gag , porter demands $70 000 , but everybody mishears him and assumes he's after the entire $130 000 haul  ) 
in his travels ( or travails ) , porter encounters several other one-named villainous cretins like fairfax ( james coburn as a white-haired , millionaire thief ) and carter ( kristofferson , as a brown-haired , millionaire thief-the kingpin of the obligatory "" operation "" )  
helgeland's film ( which was recut by mel the producer ) is devoid of an imperative dime store charm  
the novelty of seeing a big movie star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly : a ) because the bad guys can only be differentiated by their coifs , and b ) because mel's schtick doesn't evolve from act one-he's the terminator stranded in a plot without a sci-fi hook to keep us interested after the initial sadistic thrill is gone

 "" mission "" has some good ideas , but they get lost in the unbearably boring delivery , dime-a-dozen dialogue , and spate of good actors wasted in cardboard-cutout roles  
i'm sure the director and writers were very proud of each hallmark moment they came up with , so they stretch each dramatic moment out like silly putty until it loses all its charm

-1,"coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers , relentless , 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz , played by character actor leo rossi , spawned three more sequels  
relentless 3 , third in the row , features sam dietz again , but this time detective , who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case , doesn't want to deal with similar line of work  
divorced , demoralised and transferred , he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer , and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz's old cases  
to make things even more interesting , it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation  
fans of the british tv films and mini-series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies  
they both feature vicious psychopathic killers , yet also give a lot of , usually depressive , details about chief investigator's private lives  
this one isn't an exception , but similarities with british television are only in content  
the execution and style is different , which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best  
useless , gratuitous erotica also doesn't help either , obviously making this film longer than it should be "
-1,"the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie ( if you don't count neil simon's biloxi blues )  
year after year , more predictably cliched military movies come out -- most recently sgt

i thought stripes would be different  
with ivan reitman as director , bill murray as star and harold ramis as co-star and co-screenwriter , it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army  
instead , it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army  
murray , about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs , plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success , and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him  
so he does , and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell , head-shaving and marching/singing sequences , more mind-numbingly stale here than ever  
the characters are even less original , ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette "
-1,"for a film touted as exploring relationships and black sexuality , trois is surprisingly tame  
despite it's lurid subject matter and it's passing nod to fatal attraction , it moves along with flat , uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film  
freshly moved to atlanta , jermaine ( dourdan ) and his wife , jasmine ( moore ) , have the trappings of a perfect life  
they have a beautiful house in suburbia  
jermaine is a lawyer on the fast track at his firm

-1,"the film may be called mercury rising , but that title doesn't describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture , a routine thriller that combines government cover-ups with a cloying and poorly-motivated buddy story  
the "" hook "" that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic  
however , aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance , this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device  
those expecting to see even a semi-thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed  
mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism  
the script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard- to-swallow  
i don't know whether the problem is in the original book , simple simon , or in the screenplay adaptation , but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible  
once again , certain standby plot elements -- the high-level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent -- are recycled , and not to good effect  
while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood , this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense "
-1,"contrary to popular belief , not every single foregin film released to an american market is a masterpiece

some examples of this principle are the aboslutely dreadful "" un indien dans la ville "" ( presented as "" little indian , big city , "" and remade into that crap tim allen flick , "" jungle2jungle "" ) , and this

critique : incoherent , boring , one-act drivel with no suspense , horribly unbelievable futuristic environment , bad dialogue , career-defining bad acting by keanu reeves and a hilarious ending  
it's too bad because the premise of the film was interesting , but unfortunately for my friends and i , this movie turned out to be just as bad as everyone had warned us  
it's one of those films that makes you start laughing half-way through , when you realize that most of the actors in it suck , the location shots are filmed in dark "" junkyard "" type areas which they would like to have us believe to be futuristic ( whatever    ) , and all the sets look like  "
-1,"don't let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare  
no one will truly understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work , and this movie makes a vain attempt at that  
any moves to ? glamorise' his life , which hollywood has an annoying tendency to do , will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness  
this movie about his life , although well written , puts too much make-up on a man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes , rather than lobster and champagne  
oh well , let's fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bit of a flirtatious play-write , who falls in love with a beautiful woman ( gwyneth paltrow ) and from her inspiration , several plays develop - ? romeo and juliet' , and ? the twelfth night'  
it is easier for me to believe that he had a wet dream and that's how all his plays develop , but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama  
but i guess my version probably wouldn't draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen  
so is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare , when all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul  
i think not "
-1,"when a film is produced on a shoestring budget by a couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of a genuine tragedy , the easy path for a reviewer who hated the movie is to give it a pass  
toss out your usual objectivity , ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it , forget how unbearable it was to sit through , and find some meaningless way to compliment it  
this , of course , will be of no service to your readers , but at least you'll avoid the hate mail from the movie's fans  
thus it is with a heavy heart that i review the movie paulina ( not to be confused with the recent movie paulie about a talking parrot )  
directed by vicky funari as a labor of intense love - she spent the last one third of her life on film - the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez  
paulina was a maid in vicky's household when vicky was young  
i got to learn the film's background when i attended a screening in which the two women who made it were present  
for those without such context , the reaction to the film may be that it is a parody of a bad indie film  
the acting is amateurish , the story is maudlin , and it has all the visual appeal of a bad home movie "
-1,"shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen  
it is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies  
that is , however , not to say it is a good film , a quality production or anything of the sort  
shakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work  
the finest sign of this may be the plot , in looking back , there seems to be little more than a thin , predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books  
philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london  
it is at the peak of the royal theatre era , and queen elizabeth ( the recently damed judi dench , by , appropriately enough , queen elizabeth ii ) is very much a fan  
however , to directly quote the film , he has "" cash flow problems  ""

-1,"frank detorri's ( bill murray ) a single dad who lives on beer and junk food with no apparent understanding of sanitation or hygiene , much to the dismay of his preteen daughter shane ( elena franklin )  
when he uses the '10 second rule' to retrieve a hard boiled egg from a chimp's cage at the zoo and downs it , he introduces a lethal bacteria into his system  
inside his skin , the city of frank is in turmoil thanks to the vote-pandering of mayor phlegmming ( voice of william shatner ) , so it's up to one frank pd white blood cell ( voice of chris rock ) to save the day in peter and bobby farrelly's "" osmosis jones  "" 
the city of frank is a brightly animated ( animation directed by piet kroon and tom sito ) cellular municipality where osmosis jones is a typical rogue cop looking for another chance  
he's inadvertently teamed up with drix ( voice of david hyde pierce , tv's "" frasier "" ) , a cold capsule with 12 hours worth of painkillers to dispense  
this quarrelling duo are about to go on a "" fantastic voyage "" in order to hunt down thrax ( voice of laurence fishburne ) , the virus intent on shutting down frank  
while the animation is certainly colorful to look at , osmosis jones' story is a hackneyed one  
the story cries out for puny puns , but we only get occasional sprinklings of wit or bodily humor ( drix graduated phi beta capsule , he departs on a bus headed for bladder )  
neither the hero or villain is particularly interesting ( thrax looks like an animated "" predator "" ) , although hyde pierce is a delightful sidekick "
-1," "" flubber "" is the second best example of how to take all the life out of a film remake an adaptation , and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney  
it's the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids , but anyone else will feel left out as it's boring , slow , and incredibly lifeless  
what could be a film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water , and it's a shame because it could have been a great film  
hypothetically , i mean  
 "" flubber , "" as you probably know , is a remake of the disney classic i never saw , "" the absent minded professor , "" where a , well , absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as "" flubber , "" you know , flying rubber ? 
the new one keeps the basic plot , but appears to have added a lot else , like more absent-mindedness on the part of the proffessor , some more villains , and several "" show-stopping "" moments , like a big rumba with the flubber , and some more elaborate setups , none which really make it any better , but instead make it worse  
the basic plot revolves around a college professor , philip brainerd ( robin williams ) , who creates lots and lots of inventions , but is sadly absent minded  
in fact , he's forgotten his wedding to the college's president , sara jean reynolds ( indie actress marcia gay harden ) , two times before he forgets it again at the beginning  
doesn't this warrant some kind of mental treatment ? 
anyway , on his wedding day ( the third one ) , he invents the flubber , which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed , but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in "" the abyss  ""

william shakespeare's romeo + juliet - the worst film ever made and a complete failure

-1,"david spade has a snide , sarcastic sense of humor that works perfectly on the tv sitcom just shoot me  
it also served as a good showcase for him when he co-starred , opposite the late chris farley , in tommy boy and black sheep

tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels , _knock_off_ , but this time around , style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous , and at worst incomprehensible ; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances

-1,"cradle will rock is the latest effort from director/actor tim robbins  
while he may have had an oscar worthy film back in 1995 ( dead man walking ) , he gets a little overconfident and sloppy here  
the story is confusing , and filled with many subplots , so i'll try my best and explain it as simply as possible  
the film is based on a "" mostly "" true story about a federal theater in the 1930s , that produced a play ( the cradle will rock ) that apparently was offensive to some , so the government shuts it down  
it's during the time of the depression , and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs , or are poor  
between this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots , about those who work in theater , or those associated  
also along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience  
tim robbin's just keeps piling on political views , and characters , that we just give up on the film , or in some cases walk out  
for robbin's it may be a nice achievement , but to me it seemed more like a friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue , and fancy outfits "
-1,"this is the worst movie i've viewed so far in 98  
the avengers = silly = man dressed in a bowler hat + woman wearing tight leathers > evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits + greater evil , sir august de wynter wearing kilt  
the question is what could have gone wrong with a potentially great idea with big name cast ? 
the same question was probably asked of last year's stinker batman and robin  
i feel the production got a little too smug , the script a little to smart and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided together to form a movie  
my greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry between emma peel and john steed ( thurman and fiennes ) ? something that was a vital element of the 60's tv serial of the same name  
the dialogue goes on and on about tea and other finer british perks , but does not allow much room for character development and interaction , except to perhaps grate on the viewer's nerves
