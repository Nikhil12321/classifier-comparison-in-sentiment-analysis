1,"many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come , the new film by visionary director vincent ward  
most will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors  
but little do they know ( as i so plainly found out ) that this has quite a complex story to tell  
walking out of the theater , i could see the audience's disgust    
one member even had to be awakened after the film ended  
don't believe the previews that you see    
this is definitely not a film for everyone  
this is quite possibly one of the most adult-oriented films to come out in recent years  
kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline  
the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us  
it goes back and forth in time , as if it has no boundaries  
think of the film city of angels  
now add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision  
both films deal with the afterlife , but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office  
costing around $85 million to make , the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it's money back  
but due to it's story , i doubt it will  
for everyone who thought titanic's story was too simple and cliche , here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay , it may not have done nearly as well  
but don't get me wrong    
i hope the film does do well  
it's a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen  
i doubt most of us could have thought of this place , even in our own mind  
what dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals  
the only film that surpasses it is dark city  
full of rich , shocking colors , we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to  
but don't do that , because you'll end up going to hell  
what dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake  
chris "" christy "" nielsen ( robin williams ) is startled by the sudden jolt , but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat  
annie ( annabella sciorra ) spies chris , as well , and both eventually bond and get married  
annie is an artist , whose paintings are colorful , lush , and surrealistic  
chris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself  
they also have two children , marie ( jessica brooks ) and ian ( josh paddock )  
but one day , the two children are killed in a car crash , and it almost destroys annie  
she tries to commit suicide , but fails , and is then put in an institution  
chris copes with the problem by realizing they aren't around anymore , and nothing will change that  
just as annie gets her life back in order , chris is killed while trying to save the life of a car crash victim  
chris goes to heaven , or his version of heaven , rather  
guided by albert ( cuba gooding , jr  ) , chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy  
that is , until he realizes how miserable he is without annie  
prior to heaven , he would try to comfort annie , but the more he was around , the more pain she felt  
chris decides to leave her alone  
little does he realize what will happen next  
i'm not about to say , because the plot point is crucial to the rest of the story ( many critics , however , give it away )  
certainly , chris dying is crucial to the plot , but they tell you that he dies in the previews  
story is not necessarily important for this movie to work , because it deals with the afterlife  
however , strangely , virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil  
a couple of comments here and there , but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life  
 "" we're soul mates ! "" 
chris exclaims  
heaven , in movies , is almost always depicted as a glowing city of white , purity , and love  
usually , it also looks like it rests among the clouds  
but what dreams may come goes a different route  
it shows us a heaven that most of us have never seen before  
chris' heaven is his memories brought to life  
his thoughts can make anything real , and he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven  
 "" i've never seen anyone use real paint before , "" albert says  
equally good as the depictions of hell which cast away the normal stereotypes of fire and brimstone  
instead , it's a state of being  
in one gloriously horrific scene , chris and his "" tracker "" ( max von sydow ) arrive at a sea of faces  
thousands of heads are stuck above ground , their bodies somewhere else "

1,"ladies and gentlemen , 1997's independence day is here ! 
it's title : starship troopers  
and surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4  
i realize that i gave last year's sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour  
after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn't as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review  
starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem  
as a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film  
in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film  
starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether  
while starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : "" the 'star wars' of the 90s  "" 
am i being to generous to this film ? 
perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races  
in essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction  
the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to  
starship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a "" kick-the-aliens'-asses "" style  
id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role  
this new "" star wars "" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs  an alien species  
the alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects  
however , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy  
sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization  
more than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends  
and they should be  
i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film  
this is an "" event "" film , but surprisingly above average  
it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved )  
starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange "" join the army "" ads  
mixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original  
stating , "" would you like to know more ? "" , 
these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously  
however , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way  
after witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw  
we are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards )  
rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms  
however , carmen isn't as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot  
however , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico  
unfortunately , rico isn't interested in dizzy  
this setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch  
carmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up  
and as a result , dizzy signs up  
everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry  
the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships  
in reality , i found myself watching a space version of "" melrose place , "" but with better special effects  
an hour into the film , the war begins  
a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with  
the first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must )  
following the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war  
the bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else  
many dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs' attacks  
a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense  
the troopers are ordered to locate the "" brain "" and capture it  
i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot  
it's about special effects and gory violence  
director verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall  
verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood  
starship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year's event horizon  
the r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it  
my guess is that verhoeven's target audience is the 18 to 25 male group  
the film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women  
despite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful  
while watching the film , we never second guess the character's decisions because they seem perfectly clear  
thankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with  
the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you  
casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon  
to most guys , he will come across as artificial  
fortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character  
dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character  
her dizzy is extremely likeable "

1,"here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop  
okay , it isn't quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart  
most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them  
however , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered  
a lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash  
but , the thing is , it isn't  
it's well made , well acted , and quite intelligent  
i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film  
but the species series isn't about the lack of these elements  
it's about how much it can get into one film  
and yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so  
species ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe  
many films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film's needs  
species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars  
aboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut  
patrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed  
well , it would seem that he has succeeded  
landing on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so  
of course , he isn't the first ever  
about a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life  
now , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky  
no life lives on it  
that is , no visible life  
patrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground  
he takes them aboard , and puts them in storage  
unfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship  
just prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings  
they pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can't even remember  
they blame it on a technical malfunction  
back on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible  
as we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet  
however , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is  
patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge )  
eve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien  
however , this time around , most of her "" alien "" urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant  
the project is led by dr  laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable  
since she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again  
and it has  
story-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can't tell me it was strong on story )  
what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay  
in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles  
this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it )  
the script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot  
beginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie  
and it does it quite well  
the characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do  
the only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does  
there are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects  
the special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad  
but for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children )  
also , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone's head being blown off  
however , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary  
many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence  
however , i tend to disagree  
what were the alien films about ? 
and , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn't you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ? 
my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store  
i didn't realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one )  
the acting is quite good for this kind of film  
it is a vast improvement over the first film , at least  
the acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens  
okay , so it isn't that good  
george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting  
natasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage  
however , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent  
oh yeah , and she's quite fun to just plain watch "

1,"most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts  
my family , for the most part , hates him and his movies  
i think he's very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years  
so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of  
unrestrained by physical boundaries , allen's humor comes shining through  
those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen's intelligent observations of life  
those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one  
in 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they'd never seen before  
toy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present  
many critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture  
antz , however , has upped the ante considerably  
disney's a bug's life isn't due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal  
by beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience's thirst for computer-animated films  
but don't let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared  
in the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios  
in 1997 , it was the volcano duel  
in my opinion , dante's peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality  
volcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations  
in 1998 , there are twice as many competing films  
first was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it's cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact  
but now , it's even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks )  
who will prevail ? 
time will tell , but i'm sure that mr  mouse has nothing to fear  
this may sound like i didn't like antz ; on the contrary , i'd put it up there with toy story  
but due to it's pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn't appear in disney's version  
some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film  
sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd  
the humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended  
this is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents  
antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen's shtick and franz kafka's metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug  
z ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker  
 "" when you're the middle child in a family of five million    "" he comments about his neglected childhood  
one night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life  
in walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown  
bala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader  
after discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there's a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony  
in order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants  
but to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her  
he and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed  
the queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony  
meanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him  
so z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites  
the battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence  
however , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence  
the second half of the film revolves around z's kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia  
there , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants  
the adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass  
looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i'm just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally )  
the ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground  
visually , it's an exciting rush of adrenaline  
but don't be fooled    
little kids shouldn't see this , as they may just try and copy it  
after seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again  
hopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel  
as an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date  
visually , it's as stunning as what dreams may come  
the best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren't limited by gravity  
they can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible  
one great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball  
the animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball "

1,"making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed , especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece  
when it comes to living up to expectations , a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure  
for a sequel to live up to or even surpass the original's greatness is very rare indeed  
and whereas "" babe : pig in the city "" misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe , it is a worthy companion piece  
more than that , it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like "" the godfather : part ii "" and "" the empire strikes back "" as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" picks up precisely where "" babe "" left off  
having won the sheep herding competition , farmer hoggett ( james cromwell ) and his pig are elevated to fame status  
a series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs  hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city  
in doing so , the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" flourishes where so many sequels fail  
most sequels simply rehash the events of the first film  
not "" babe : pig in the city ""  
this is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first  
also , by not being content to utilize most of the old characters , this film gives us many new ones to enjoy  
in essence , it doesn't attempt to copy itself  
instead , it strives to achieve an originality of its own  
and it succeeds  
that's not to say the familiar is absent  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film  
along with babe himself , ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride , as does mrs  hoggett ( one of this decade's best and most underappreciated comic characterizations , hilariously performed by magda szubanski )  
the three singing mice also make the journey , chiming in with their cute high-pitched vocals  
the story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice  
from there , we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne's soothingly deep narrative  
composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these  
but these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting  
while staying at the flealands hotel , babe encounters a veritable ark-full of new animals  
monkeys , kittens , and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new "" urbanites "" that babe befriends , as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter  
each character is distinctly unique , some of which are imbued with personal human-like struggles that are endearing and touching  
and while this world focuses largely on these animals , we are introduced to two new human characters as well  
mary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel , an animal-loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors  
stein's landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature  
we also meet fugly floom , an old soft-spoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel , utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions  
not having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film , it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was  
so as not to ruin this well-kept secret , i won't reveal the actor's identity here  
it was a treat indeed to see one of cinema's legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance  
the greatest triumph of "" babe : pig in the city "" is the art direction  
simply put--it bleeds creativity , taking the look of the original film to a whole new level  
restricted primarily to a farm the first time around , this second installment creates an entire city , dazzling us with unique fable-like architecture  
but the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world's architectural landmarks  
designing a skyline that includes the statue of liberty , the sydney opera house , the brooklyn bridge , the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower , ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities ( as seen in the film photo and pre-production drawing to your right )  
added to that , many of this city's streets are the twin siblings of venice's gondola-trekked rivers  
the metropolis that has sprung from ford's vision is a wondrous sight to behold  
it is a world that you want to walk around in  
norma moriceau's costume designs belong in this world , vibrant in color and style equal to that of the ford's landscape  
most of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish , with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly floom's clown outfit  
andrew lesnie's photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the film's multiple emotional tones  
much press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of "" babe : pig in the city ""  
reports stated that its original cut was branded with a pg-13 rating  
these reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned a pg rating  
but even so , to be anything harsher than the original' s g rating had many parents and fans up in arms  
by deleting a minimal number of shots , "" babe : pig in the city "" was eventually given the coveted g rating  
although appeased , many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark , fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself  
well , to coin a phrase , the reports of "" babe : pig in the city "" 's death at the hands of a dark , scary , felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated  
granted it has its moments of pseudo-morbidity , but all-in-all "" babe : pig in the city "" is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be  
whatever "" dark "" moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller ( the "" mad max "" trilogy , "" the witches of eastwick "" , "" lorenzo's oil "" )  
having served as a producer and co-writer on the first film , miller moves into the director's chair for this one , putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise  
the story of "" babe : pig in the city "" is an enchanting yarn , but one that doesn't achieve the emotional or character depth of the original  
missing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity , an individual's worth , challenging conformity , and one's purpose in life  
 "" babe "" dealt with this weighty subject matter , creating a timeless fable  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" should not have rehashed these themes , but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones  
this film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife , class differences , sacrificial courage , and so on  
but this film's goals aren't as lofty as the first's , instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach , allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting , sometimes intense , fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive "

1,"i rented "" brokedown palace "" last night blind , having heard nothing about it beforehand , and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws  
for anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety  
that is no easy task  
superficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably "" return to paradise "" and "" midnight express  "" 
as a result nearly every review of "" brokedown palace "" i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons  
the consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as this is a fine film  
for those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was "" midnight express "" ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of "" return to paradise  "" 
in my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad's acclaimed novel , "" lord jim  "" 
problematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world "" justice "" system  
the girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale )  
they're life-long buddies who planned a high-school graduation trip to hawaii , and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents  
once there , they find a $6 hotel and go sight-seeing , which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside  
they get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room , a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them , but they are saved from hotel security by a charming , friendly australian , nick ( daniel lapaine ) , who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl's scam  
he then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves , first toward alice , then toward darlene  
by now alarm bells are going off among viewers  
the ever-present nick is too slick and his stories don't add up ( to us ) --the girls , of course , are too naive to notice  
long before it happens , we're anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast-talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting-ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin  
just as predictably , the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison-bound for a long stretch  
left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice  
for those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl's fleabag hotel  
as one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed , the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer/fixer "" yankee hank "" ( bill pullam ) and his thai-born partner-wife  
a recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film's tag lines , "" who do you trust ? , "" and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullman's oeuvre will find few surprises  
much of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short-hand fashion  
lou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments  
is he part of a wider conspiracy ? 
with an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them  
the result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls' interaction , hank's investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension--as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape  
if "" brokedown palace "" has a major flaw , it is its creators' tendency , like time-constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half-way down and return to the story's main avenue  
and , if that were all there was to "" brokedown palace , "" it wouldn't be a very good movie  
but i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded  
for the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom--in all its permutations  
ultimately , the other sub-themes may be considered window dressing  
young and pretty , alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild , streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure  
presented as a perfect blend of yin and yang , dark and light , is her cautious best friend , darlene ( beckinsale )  
clear-eyed and straightforward , alice is more complex than her friend  
she comes from a poorer background , has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father )  
whereas darlene's life is "" on-track , "" aimed at college , marriage , kids , a career , a suburban home , middle age and "" fulfillment , "" alice's is uncertain , unfocused , and yearning  
one poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors--friends and relatives from home , whose lives continue while hers is in limbo  
tellingly , alice is present but not included  
just as revealing of their different personalities , when alice and dar first come to thailand , the openness and delight on alice's face doesn't read as simple naivet ? ; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat , reaching toward the sun , she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom , while "" dar "" remains seated in the shade  
 "" brokedown palace "" begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank  
however unintentional , it's all alice's fault  
she's responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents , to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand , to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick  
 ( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film's beginning , darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison  ) 
dar , of course , is the willing dupe which , in her view , confers innocence  
never mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate  
dar is innocent  
it doesn't matter  
alice is the subject of this movie  
she and her journey toward personal freedom  
along the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half-baked sensibilities and materialistic goals  
in the end , that culture , like its representatives , "" yankee "" hank and dar's father ( a "" man who knows how to grease the wheels "" ) , proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl's tragedy  
thailand's culture , contrary to most opinion , comes off much better by comparison  
it amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes  
i believe the filmmaker's view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior  
the thai ( with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy ) were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles  
the girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native-born  
their prison ( in stark contrast to the probable reality ) was no hellhole , being relatively clean and sunlit  
the prison authorities demanded good hygiene , provided medical care when needed , and "" hard manual labor "" consisted of picking grass ! 
the thai guards were authoritarian ( what else ? ) but certainly not routinely sadistic  
as for the thai justice system , the reasoning of the thai judges , during both an appeal hearing and in the film's penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality  
'freedom' has many faces and "" brokedown palace "" explores many of them  
in the extreme , we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit  
some settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter  
but freedom seldom comes without a price  
which is why the movie's other tag lines are : "" what is your dream ? "" 
and "" how far would you go ? "" 
i believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom , incarcerated or not , by film's end is alice  
she finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility "

1,"review : a dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in 19th century flanders  
living with his grandfather jehan ( jack warden ) in poverty , nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times ( they are renting a spare one-room cottage , and the greedy , malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them `out of the house' if they don't pay the rent )  
nello also has a rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen , in either a movie or in real life  
 ( his hero is peter paul rubens , the great flemish painter of the 17th century  ) 
not that these are the only things that make nello's life happy , however  
he has a dog of flanders , whom he names patrasche , who is a heroic rin-tin-tin of the 19th century , whom he rescues from his cruel , unkind master  
in addition , he even has a best friend ( and future sweetheart ) in the lovely , wealthy aloise , whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with `lower-class' nello  
 ( he thinks he's not good enough for her , and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying  ) 
but then , he was a poor guy himself before he married ( as mentioned later on in the film )  
one day , nello encounters a mysterious , yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande ( played wonderfully by jon voight ) , who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart , and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist  
and every christmas , there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year ; the winner getting a lot of money  
eager to save his home ( and his aging , dying grandfather ) , nello willingly decides to become an artist , asking aloise to pose for him  
one night , the two travel to a circus , where they have their fortune told ? one of the film's most delightful scenes ? that great happiness is destined for them  
she gives the kids a ring , whom nello places on aloise's hand  
 ; ) afterwards , the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers  
unfortunately , things are not all `la-dee-dah' in this tale  
aloise's father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again  
bad enough that they can't see each other ( although we know nello and aloise , don't we ? ) , but that's only the start of nello's troubles  
aloise's farm is burned down , and nello is wrongfully accused ( by the landord of his cottage ) for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise  
this decreases nello's reputation around the town , save aloise and her parents , and a kindly miller , william , who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by  
matters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies , and he has to pay for his funeral  
but then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home ( for not paying his rental ) ? permanetly  
this means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold , freezing wind  
worst of all , the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time , `the portrait of the princess' , fails to win the prize at the festival  
now nello and patrasche are really depressed , and close to freezing to death  
will nello be able to find any happiness in his life ? 
will patrasche save the day ? 
will nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise ? 
a dog of flanders is a delightful , heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages  
even older ones who consider themselves too `sophisticated' for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grown-ups , too  
there have been other movies of this ilk ( boy and dog ) , and while this one falls into that category , it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties and finding a good home for yourself  
move over ? or rather , roll over ? old yeller , this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight  
the cinematography , courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful , and really adds to the powerful drama of the film  
it also gives a feel of being in flanders ( the whole film was respectably shot in flanders )  
the music from richard friedman is also remarkable ; an evocative , poignant score that recaptures music from the 19th century  
the opening song over the credits is very beautiful ( i hope the soundtrack is available ! ) , and there's a brief excerpt of `cheer up , charlie' from willy wonka and the chocolate factory ( sung by aloise , to nello , in another delightful scene )  
the cast is first-rate : jesse james and jeremy james kissner , who play nello , are some of the most endearing , adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life ( so are the girls who play aloise , madyline sweeten as the younger , and farren monet as the older )  
not that they are the only good stars , however  
jack warden is ideal as jehan , eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character  
 ( the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming , touching ones  ) 
also , bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william  
he's another one of my favorite characters in the film  
but jon voight , as i mentioned before , is the perfect choice for michel  
he brings a mysterious , yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he * can * win the contest  
but what makes this film fun to watch is how well-defined the characters are , and the pace of the story ( best of all , it has a happy ending ? though i will * not * give it away ; sorry ) is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters  
for the first time since the beginning of 1999 , there comes a film which doesn't rely on popular formula stuff , such as big-budget special effects , commercial rock soundtracks , or any of that stuff  
this one relies on telling a fully character-oriented story , with just the right amount of heart , humor , and drama  
that , to me , is what makes a dog of flanders all the more delightful  
eleanor o'sullivan of `the home news & tribune' noticed this , and was kind and generous enough to welcome it : `for want of a better word , a glow surrounds a dog of flanders  
its heart is in the right place and it engages you  
you can guess where the film is going because this is well-traveled territory , but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner , an often-told story is well worth a revisit  ' 
in addition , there were a couple of other enthusiasts , such as chicago-sun times and the washington post ( you should read their reviews ; they're really positive )  
other critics , however , were not so kind  
stephen holden of `the new york times' had more than a share of beatings to lay upon a dog of flanders via pen writing  
he found the film to be a `sea of sugary bromides' and condemned mr  voight's character as `hopelessly wooden ? adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda  ' 
in addition , `entertainment weekly' slam-dunked the film , condemning it as `the worst family film of the year  ' 
there have been so many other bad reviews like this , too  
my suggestion : disregard the critics  
they just have a big problem with touching family films , and one should never pay attention to them  
this dog of flanders may only be a little `family' movie ( it probably won't be a big hit in the style of titanic , but then again no other film has been since then ) , but that is not a bad thing in and of itself  
this is a story that is sure to warm your heart , and that is what really matters about a dog of flanders  
it is also one of the better family films around this year  
none of the other films i have seen this year ( though they were good ) have been so low-key and touching  
if you're looking for family-style entertainment , look no further than this charming boy-and-dog yarn  
go see it while you still can , for as i mentioned , it might not be a big bow-wow at the box office for a long time  
see it while you can  
there is really no need to compare a multi-million dollar blockbuster such as star wars : episode i ? the phantom menace or tarzan , or even the iron giant with a tender , sweet little family movie "

1,"much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of "" lolita , "" made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made , over its use of pedophilia , and as such , it's important to address it straight-forwardly , before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed , as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years , lying around in vaults san a distributor , and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit  
when seeing this film , after all the hoopla , keeping in mind that there are people , namely me , who are fans of the novel , who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation    well , 
you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution  
what's even worse is that seeing this "" lolita , "" especially the first time and if you're familiar with anything "" lolita , "" is admittingly very anticlimactic  
this is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film , ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it , it's really quite a film , perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne ( although , really , look at its competition : "" flashdance , "" "" fatal attraction , "" and "" indecent proposal "" ) , at least besides "" jacob's ladder  "" 
i've seen this "" lolita "" twice : the first time , i wasn't so blown away  
it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting  
the second time , not really thinking about how i've waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i'm seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre , it really affected me emotionally  
the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one , which is why it's such a good novel , and why this is such a good film  
the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a  k  a  lolita is great because it's not trash for the perverted but because it's about human obsession with things that are out of one's reach  
its protagonist , the comically-named humbert humbert , is not your average pedophile , but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies  
the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology , something that will destroy us but that we can't live without  
these ideas are all worked into this film nicely , but done in a way that is not heavy-handed at all , but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating  
the focus of this film , and the reason for making it , it seems , was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images , and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized  
the tone of the book is a comical one , but it's also a tragic one , and humbert , telling the story from his perspective , blows every single thing out of perspective  
humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires , and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed  
we get a sense that perhaps it's by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed  
he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love , and allows himself to embody her as lolita  
he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions , and by the end , he has nothing but overly-dramatic feelings for her  
the story recognizes the extreme of this , almost out of a test , seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert , and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author , vladimir nabokov , wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions , and perhaps bring them to peace  
the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end , when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey , we can easily sympathize and even identify with him  
the opening and final images of the film are the same , and who hasn't done a similar action , that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us ? 
this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen , the first time being filmed in - shock - 1962 , by stanley kubrick , who couldn't possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do , but did the next best thing : he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general  
in that film , he used the traps of society as benefits  
the studio demanded the final scene , that of a heinous murder , come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile    and 
when you see it , it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession  
the censors wouldn't allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the , um , relationship between humbert and lolita , so kubrick decided to play it as comedy , but still allow the tragedy to seep through  
looking at these two versions , especially after reading the novel ( and we all know that when we've read a novel and see a film adaptation , we are bound to be angered by any size differences ) , it's really impossible to compare them  
they both go for different things , and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was  
and although it's true that several scenes are similar , and are thus up for comparison , overall it's unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse  
i have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is , and i won't say that here  
however , this film is pretty amazing , mostly because hey , i loved the book , and this film nearly reminded me of it  
it doesn't have nearly as much wit ( a couple comical scenes , and even a lot of good chuckles , but just not totally witty ) , but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had  
some of that is in the casting of the two leads  
jeremy irons , with his deep , soft british voice and gentle look , is an amazing humbert  
he's droll in a very unique way , and , well , no one can look distraught the way he does  
he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience  
and when he looks at lolita with love , and she looks at him with lust , you know that he's her prisoner for as long as he lives  
and dominique swain , who plays the title character , is rather incredible  
she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original , wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction , bratiness , and self-centeredness that marks the character  
it's easy to see why she surrenders to humbert : she loves the attention , and knows that she can have her way with him at any time  
when he denies her something , she blackmails him effortlessly ( a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic ) , and when he stands up to her , she weeps and runs away , leaving humbert to follow her  
there are two other minor characters in the film , one who's a road block in the beginning , and the other who's a reappearing threat to the relationship  
the former is charlotte , lolita's mother , played by melanie griffith  
in the book , charlotte is a monster of a woman : overbearing , constantly scolding her child , overly-religious , and ultimately selfish  
and she's the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal , at least in the beginning  
as played by shelly winters in the original , she represented all these qualities ; as played by griffith here , she's about half of them  
it's annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first  
and even though griffith is not really bad , persay , she's nothing more  
the other is clare quilty , the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita , and succeeds , but at a price  
langella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original  
quilty was a comic character in the original : a threat in the form of many forms , popping in states of rambling , german , proning , and eventually drunk  
langella takes the other route , allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed , and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots , and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending , the exact opposite of what we thought of him  
as you can see , most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter , stephen schiff , but just parts of a whole new look at the novel , at least cinema-wise  
this version is beautiful , and perpetually saddening  
the camera movements are stylized , and each shot is breathtakingly rich  
the acting is for the most part wonderful , and when we watch it , we really get a sense that for humbert , who is telling the story , the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita  
more importantly , it takes us right up the brink of emotion , then jumps right over it  
by the end , with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car , following what he says is the only part of his life he doesn't regret , we feel that we all lose to something we can never have "

1,"when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be "" you too can believe whales can fly ""  
then it was going to be "" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly ""  
then , it was going to be "" you too can believe wood sprites can fly ""  
finally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say    
there's a lot of flying going on in this film ! 
as our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in  
well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released  
part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release )  
subsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved )  
to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high  
in an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us  
after the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters  
is the format effective for the film ? 
with a few exceptions , yes  
the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven's fifth symphony  
it's hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily  
everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts  
eventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things  
though this segment isn't very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies  
the next segment is set to ottorino respighi's "" the pines of rome ""  
in this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape  
a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack  
he is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the "" oceans "" of clouds  
again , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved  
reportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size  
the cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images  
one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent  
absolutely beautiful stuff  
the third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin's "" rhapsody in blue ""  
this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york  
there's a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife  
i won't go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending  
unfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments  
segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich's "" piano concerto no  2 "" and is an animated version of hans christian andersen's "" the steadfast tin soldier ""  
a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can't see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester  
the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina  
little does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from  
the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl  
although the ending has been altered from the andersen story , "" the steadfast tin soldier "" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short  
some children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made  
segment five is the funniest of the bunch  
set to camille saint-saens "" the carnival of the animals "" , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo-yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number  
while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy  
segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it's the one that people remember most , "" the sorcerer's apprentice ""  
the story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo  
unfortunately , the segment wasn't made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain  
there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain  
similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18-plus screen theaters  
segment seven is set to sir edward elgar's "" pomp and circumstance march no  1 "" and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character  
donald duck "" stars "" as an assistant to noah , whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark  
during the loading , donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn't make it on the boat  
they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners  
despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece , it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear-jerkers foisted on audiences these days  
powerful stuff  
segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich ? "" saving the best for last ""  
set to igor stravinsky's "" the firebird "" , an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape  
trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation  
when the sprite examines the formation , it awakens and becomes the titular firebird  
in a stunning spectacle , the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path , including everything that the sprite has worked to create  
some amazing animation is present here , and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone ( although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film )  
the host segments are largely ( no pun intended ) throwaways , although steve martin's clip is pretty funny  
be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin  
penn and teller are usually funny , but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting "

1,"in intolerance , d  w  griffith told four different historical stories at the same time , cutting from one to the other  
each of the stories builds to a fast-paced climax  
in magnolia , paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others  
yet the stories and where they are going are all independent  
what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized  
each story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment ) but then lets the tension dissolve  
while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along , even though they are not in the same scene  
then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again  
it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked  
this creates some strange effects  
the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships  
the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content  
we have the story of a dying man earl partridge ( jason robards ) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends  
phil parma ( philip seymour hoffman ) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal  
partridge's young wife linda ( julianne moore ) is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies , but for an unsuspected reason  
frank mackey ( tom cruise ) runs the kinds of self-help seminar that businesses like so much , but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit-heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women's lib  
officer jim kurring ( john c  reilly ) is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place  
jimmy gator ( philip baker hall ) hosts a popular children's tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector ( jeremy blackman ) and former quiz kid donnie smith ( william h  macy )  
the film juggles all these stories for over three hours , but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily  
each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax , but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story  
the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories  
the film seems to be built around strange events and weird history , but it really has little to do with the content of the stories , though they all are connected in part by one weird event  
magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson , though in my opinion his two previous films , hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories  
it is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson's company  
john c  reilly seems to be a standard fixture  
particularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight  
here he several of the characters are mesmerizing , but that characteristic is not really used  
as studies of characters these stories are each worth following  
as well-rounded stories with a beginning , middle and end , they leave something to be desired  
but the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through  
i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale  
heavy spoiler    
heavy spoiler    
heavy spoiler    
heavy spoiler    
during the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen  
and in actual fact , it does  
since biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods  
it is , however , a perfectly natural , if somewhat unnerving , phenomenon  
the cause is associated with whirlwinds  
we know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air , holding them aloft  
the reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister  
smaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are  
when the whirlwind is over water , animals near the surface , frequently fish and frogs , may suffer the same fate  
essentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind , held aloft by updrafts , and finally dropped elsewhere  
so while the rain is possible , some doubts do creep in  
the rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs  
it seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped  
it is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon  
 ( frankly i have no idea on these points  ) 
otherwise the event was quite believable  
what we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano "

1,"mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence  ) 
with three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest "" hot properties "" in action adventure stardom , and it's just about time  
for over twenty-five years , jackie's been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy  
 "" drunken master "" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to "" make it big "" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong  
i'm not entirely sure why , exactly  
in many ways , "" drunken master "" is similar to most of jackie's other early films , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii , "" master with cracked fingers "" , "" half a loaf of kung fu "" , "" spiritual kung fu "" , and others  
in fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories  
to be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste  
they're quite different from action movies as we know them in america  
these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together  
 "" drunken master "" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception  
 ( as an aside , "" drunken master "" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen    in 
a movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival  
at the time , i didn't really think it was anything special    but 
after having seen more films like it , it's kind of grown on me  ) 
 "" drunken master "" 's storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii and "" master with cracked fingers "" --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been "" adapted , "" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid )  
more specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka "" naughty panther , "" a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough  
after embarrassing his instructor's assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can    and 
is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively  
his father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages  
kei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all  
while escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more  
this turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu  
he assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up  
then , when he's ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu  
unfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them    
 "" drunken master "" features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others  
it's been said before , but i'll say it again--these fights don't just _happen_ , they're as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows  
in his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways  
the fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films  
whether jackie wins or loses , it's really something to see    and 
it's often as funny as anything , too  
and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at  
there's very little that's new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training    these 
schticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties  
but they're still hilarious as ever  
likewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they're often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own  
the really big thing about "" drunken master "" , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu  
i'm not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security    and 
it apparently helps if you're drunk while you're doing it  
genuine or not , i have to admit , there's just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what's going on  
come to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film's success over any of the other jackie films    it's 
not just martial arts , it's the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , "" whoa    "" 
on the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background  
 "" gone with the wind "" , this isn't  
still , if you like martial arts films , or like what you've seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot  
it's much more "" real "" than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme "

1,"alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters  
i saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i didn't like it  
of course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault  
in order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor  
james cameron's aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series  
i am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality  
many thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action  
both are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well-written  
as for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion  
perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped  
on the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn't see  
it was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh  
i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities  
don't get me wrong--i'm not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting  
however , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters  
as a result , alien 3's only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters  
we never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie  
there were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt  ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films  
the other character was dr  clemens ( charles dance ) , but because we like him , the inevitable occurs  
alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off  
the prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry  
without using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film  
an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card  
we see lt  ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments    
 ( title )    
a shot of an alien egg    
 ( title )    
alien legs stretch up into the air    
 ( title )    
and so on and so on  
during these first ten minutes , i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed  
it's quite a remarkable opening , and one which will remain in my mind for a long time  
because of this face-hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens , the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod , and sent down to the nearest planet : fiorina fury-161 , an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison  
however , the face-hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo-tubes , and is sent down with the escape pod  
unfortunately , during the landing , all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed  
ripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery  
of course , you need a carrier for this face-hugger , and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates  
ripley is revived and asks to see the ship  
after seeing a mysterious acid-eaten section , ripley asks to see the dead bodies , and then have them cremated  
this cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films  
featuring a monologue from dillon ( charles s  dutton ) , a prisoner who has found god , the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dog's demise  
it's one of the most memorable moments , as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog  
and this is where alien 3 succeeds  
fincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films , and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock ( in fact , he is the mixture of both )  
fincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it , and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films  
alien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images  
by doing so , fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise  
many people have criticized fincher's filming of the death scene of ripley ( i reveal nothing by saying this ) as looking too fake , but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal  
showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch , but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron , a great deal of symbolism is derived "

1,"if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it's their predictable endings  
the devil's advocate has the atypical hollywood ending , when everything that should happen does  
unfortunately for the devil's advocate , this ending nearly collapses in on itself , and ruins the entire film  
nevertheless , the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment ( note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film )  
i don't think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan  
well , it does contain this element , but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that )  
the devil's advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session  
kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl  
he ends up with a not-guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo )  
he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury  
he accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife  
after proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer  
he graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god  
he is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck  
his life seems to be on the rise  
and of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline  
he is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment  
mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted  
meanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t  nelson ) who apparently murdered three people  
he spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane  
all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself  
after a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin's wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends  
a fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin's real father  
is it all just a big nightmare ? 
or is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin's life ? 
the devil's advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don't expect  
is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ? 
if so , the devil's advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early  
i went into the devil's advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got  
i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got  
but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn't like the ending ? )  
the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you  
films like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less  
we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way  
the devil's advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all  
if that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again  
as for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study  
the film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that )  
and then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur  
it was at this point that i felt cheated  
taking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film  
everything occurs from his perspective  
he is our representation on screen ( sort of )  
but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game  
i don't want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself  
perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil's advocate is the extreme amount of everything  
it earned its r rating for a reason  
there is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity  
this film really isn't subtle about anything , showing us everything  
it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh  
however , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those  
i don't condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it  
the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch  
the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann  
portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann's problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline  
this may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her  
she is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted  
something the devil's advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature  
the story actually has something to say about humanity  
in one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course )  
he comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity  
then , god sets up rules which contradict human nature  
this semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening  
what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true  
these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil's advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i'm sure they came straight from the novel it was based on )  
when a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched  
the cast of the devil's advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don't expect "

1," "" say , any of you know how to madison ? "" 
--- brad "" asshole "" majors ( barry bostwick ) shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show  
the story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend  
in the early 70's , stage actor turned first-time playwright richard o'brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b-movies he had grown up with as a child , set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design  
the result was the stage play the rocky horror show , which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england  
the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later , in october of 1974  
the film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975    
and immediately tanked at the box office  
whether it was because fox wasn't quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn't quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop  
it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters  
a year later , something entirely strange and magical happened  
prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film  
this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time  
word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show's life as the ultimate cult film was born  
for the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton  
brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed  
they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr  everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home  
remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance  
the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet-stocking wearing mad scientist dr  frank-n-furter ( tim curry )  
frank-n-furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood )  
as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank-n-furter's mad schemes  
little do any of them know that the doctor's handyman , riff-raff ( original author richard o'brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth  
going back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has  
if i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i don't think i would have known what to make of it either  
for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film  
by the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o'brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b-movies his film is based on  
when i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity  
it goes without saying that the "" time warp "" is the most popular song in the film  
even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song  
what those who haven't seen the movie don't know though , is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment  
my personal favorite is "" over at the frankenstein place "" , but "" dammit janet "" is also maddeningly catchy  
tim curry's vocals on the rocking tune "" sweet transvestite "" need to be heard to be believed  
the finale of the film , a big floor show staged by frank-n-furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets ( including barry bostwick    
frightening ! ) , features no less than four songs ( "" rose tint my world "" , "" don't dream it "" , "" wild and untamed thing "" , and "" i'm going home "" ) , all of which are immensely singable  
the film's true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though  
despite the catchiness of the songs , this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn't have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show  
watching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans ( unless you don't mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place )  
note : director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film , in the form of a sequel , resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment , which picks up with brad and janet ( this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper ! ) as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton  
the two are menaced by the evil tv station manager ( also played by de young ) , who wishes to claim janet as his own  
o'brien returned as a writer/performer on the project ( as did quinn , campbell , and gray in performance capacity only ) , but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original  
25 years later , this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world  
as a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans , a brand new special edition 2-disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date ( even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary )  
if you are one of those people who can't get enough of the film , this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites  
in an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film , fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2-disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it'll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all  
the film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1  85 : 1 ( enhanced for 16x9 televisions )  
the film is presented in two different versions , the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called "" superheroes ""  
for ambitious viewers , the disc also includes a hidden version ( located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner ) which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen  
originally , the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz , with the first half of the it seen in black and white ( and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number )  
most reports , including a documentary on the disc , say that the color was supposed to appear when frank-n-furter first shows up in the elevator , but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version , depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced  
the film contains a commentary track by show creator ( and faithful handyman ) richard o'brien and co-star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable ( and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and half-naked on freezing cold sets , which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews )  
the two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell , but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore ( and there are quite a few )  
fox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments  
the first feature ( and the most simple ) is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is  
the second feature is an audience participation track , which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show  
most of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off , but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter  
the final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd , where a pair of lips will appear on-screen during certain scenes of the film ( mostly during the musical numbers ) that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote  
when selected , you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world  
once the segment is over , you are deposited right back into the film where you left off  
the first disc also contains a few dvd-rom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player "

1,"what if one of our cities became the target for terror ? 
what can we do ? 
what can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism ? 
what basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice to prevent another oklahoma city disaster ? 
so far america has been the leading nation , opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world  
it is the land of opportunities  
it is the land of freedom  
but what if it became the new target ? 
this dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding in reality  
when a special branch of the united states military , under the command of general william devereaux ( bruce willis ) , takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal , islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice  
the only warning the fbi receives is a single , cryptic message : "" release him  "" 
then all hell breaks loose in new york  
a bus is destroyed , killing 25 civilians  
a broadway theater is bombed  
hostages are taken at a school  
as the wave of terrorist activity crests , the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law  
devereaux argues against that eventuality , but is nevertheless ready to lead 10 , 000 men into action on american soil  
another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities  
his staff is comprised of smart , energetic , intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group o ! 
f moronic feds we're used to seeing in movies  
hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , whose department knows more about the situation than they're willing to reveal  
but the attacks escalate  
the fbi are helpless , chasing an invisible enemy  
the land is under siege  
they have lost control   a 
terror is coming from within   
what's great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror to life  
it reflects reality  
and that's why it makes such an impact  
edward zwick has created a clever , well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season  
the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously  
and so his film plays on several levels , never loosing focus on its main objective  
he is exploring the abuse of power , the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u  s  government ( the army , the fbi , and the cia )  
he takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved  
the palestinian community in 1998 new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii  
there are concentration camps and unlawful interments , all in the name of the "" greater good  "" 
in the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul -- freedom  
was that what the terror ! 
ists really wanted ? 
this film has evoked protests and objections from the arab-american population in the u  s  and n  y  especially  
but to me these protests seem unnecessary  
zwick is careful to not step over the line and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys  
the script is therefore wonderfully balanced  
agent hubbard's best friend and loyal colleague frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) is lebanese-american  
and it is quite often you hear lines such as "" my first boyfriend was palestinian  
they seduce you with their suffering "" or "" they love this country as much as we do  "" 
but no matter how you twist this matter , you won't get away from the fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arab-speaking population who are in the great majority  
more to the point , the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arab-americans by the u  s  military  
and thus this film does not serve as a source for discrimination in any ! 
way  
denzel washington is dashing as always  
in this role he is much more determined and stronger than usual  
anette bening is enjoyable and believable as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage , a network of snitches and seduction to gather information   
bruce willis is terrifying as the sadist , hungry for power , that never looses his connection with the audience , since his point of view is not too hard to understand  
the film is elegantly shaped  
the scenes are easily floating into each other and the film never seems overlong  
zwick knows exactly how to provoke tension , horror and emotions and does it with a rarely observed professionalism  
he tightens the intensity as the events progress  
and when a plot twist comes , it actually is surprising  
it is not a film drained in patriotism , like the work of roland emerich  
nor is it a film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values  
it is a daring picture that has courage enough to undertake such a risky story and difficult journey  
it has courage enough to get involved in politics "

1,"quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers  
after his pulp fiction , many actors began receiving many offers for jobs  
john travolta made his come-back and is now one of today's most bankable stars  
bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor  
jackie brown , on the other hand , boasts quite a well known cast , except for the main lead : pam grier  
most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films , but she's never really had a breakthrough performance ( her first film was in the roger ebert-written beyond the valley of the dolls )  
that is , until now  
jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino , whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction  
after mediocre acting jobs , tarantino returns to what made his name a household one : directing and writing  
jackie brown is the result , and it is fantastic entertainment  
despite excellent direction from tarantino , the cast steals the film , giving one good performance after another  
pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown , and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent--samuel l  jackson , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , and robert forster  
more than likely , you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations  
describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult , as you really can't say much or you spoil it for everyone else  
i will tread lightly  
jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport  
the camera tracks along with her , and ends up revealing her occupation  
we are also introduced to ordell robbie ( jackson ) , who sells illegal guns to interested buyers    
for a hefty price  
ms  brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away  
however , an fbi agent ( keaton ) and a local l  a  cop ( michael bowen ) are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money  
they try to reach him through beaumont livingston ( chris tucker ) , one of ordell's buyers , but he mysteriously ends up dead  
they try again through brown , but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong-doing  
but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell's friends ( fonda ) , she is caught and sent to jail  
ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent , max cherry ( forster ) , and then wants to find out what she told the cops  
after she claims to have said nothing , she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison  
ordell doesn't like this , but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track  
this scheme seems to be going as planned , but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal  
revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown , and that's the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film  
tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments ( and slang terms ) , but they are always done very well and believably  
his hitmen are normally cruel , but pleasant , in that nasty sort of way  
they talk like normal people , except for when doing business , and they are rude to their girlfriends  
of course , this is a tarantino film , and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise  
and perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop  
of course , tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film , adding a lot of his reservoir dogs-style storytelling to it  
things are told from one person's perspective , and then from another , and then from another , each time learning more and more  
this all leads up to a very interesting conclusion , which decides who is on whose side  
on the technical side of jackie brown , quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film  
however , this time around it isn't as nearly as impressive or original  
the writing , on the other hand , is quite good , although i do find tarantino's use of slang terms offensive  
the story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction , but it's much more easy to understand  
his previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation , but jackie brown is very simply to follow , especially considering that the time is given during the "" leaps "" in time  
perhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel "" rum punch "" by elmore leonard  
the dialogue is pretty much intelligent , and all the characters are fully realized  
the cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro ( who has worked with tarantino on previous films ) and the editing is very good  
and as with pulp fiction , the music is a highlight , bringing back memorable songs from the 70s and 80s  
the acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable  
the performances are incredibly rich , with hidden meaning behind every characters' actions  
nothing is quite as it seems , and you can't really tell which side one person is on  
the real treat , of course , is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown  
her poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits , which play an important role in the film  
watching grieg , i could tell what was going through her mind , even if i didn't know what she was thinking  
her face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad , happy , or in deep thought  
bridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato  
i didn't even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits ( her performance actually reminded me of heather graham's in boogie nights )  
michael keaton comes across very well , as does michael bowen  
chris tucker has a small , but effective performance  
samuel l  jackson is very good , but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction ( although much less cynical ) "

1,"star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) 
review by matt pusateri 
few movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas' 1977 classic , star wars  
the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture  
arguably , more americans today can explain what "" the force "" or a "" jedi "" is than a budget deficit or a serb  
so 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? 
can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? 
against this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week  
and despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment  
while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking  
it is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films  
the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films  
as the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson )  
the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation  
the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo's young queen amidala ( natalie portman )  
later , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice  
on tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts  
qui-gon senses the child is "" unusually strong "" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be "" the one "" prophesized to "" bring balance to the force  "" 
as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader  
complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala  
while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul  
if the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is  
the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin's turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy  
but the complexity is not overwhelming  
the story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode  
one of the reasons the film's story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused  
it's unclear whose story phantom menace is  
in the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke's story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight  
but it's unclear whether this new film is anakin's story or obi-wan's  
if this trilogy is centered on anakin , it's a shaky foundation  
lloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive  
on screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is "" the one  "" 
the rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas  
neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight  
mcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility  
portman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality  
the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them  
individually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series  
but unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn't do as good of a job playing the characters off one another  
in star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke  
the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities  
in the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other  
there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other  
individually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them  
this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers  
but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging  
many of the wonderful elements of lucas' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining  
first , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates  
the characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing "" destroyers "" on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council  
each location is elaborate and complex  
lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines  
most of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren't possible when the films were made  
more than ever , in this new film , lucas' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters  
the best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves  
watto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room  
of all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable  
speaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks  
with more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy  
jar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon's accidental sidekick  
jar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble  
the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors  
however , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar isn't completely convincing  
he still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene  
throughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a "" roger rabbit "" -like presence  
you accept that he's there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character  
initially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film  
on my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn't mind him at all  
a second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates  
despite all the film's struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one's destiny and "" the force , "" like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously "

1,"natural born killers is really a very simple story that , in essence , has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis , mood and degree  
both films glamorize "" outlaws , "" in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers  
both relate the story of a couple liberated by love  
but where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle , natural born killers is total and blatant  
where bonnie & clyde was social , natural born killers is psychological  
what bonnie & clyde hinted at , natural born killers confronts and explores  
what bonnie and clyde stole , mickey and mallory kill  
to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them , expressed metaphorically as killing , subdues the mysterious power this film wields  
for the most part , when mickey and mallory kill , they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily , they kill what is trying to kill them , they kill what dissembles and cowers from life , they kill what needs to be killed  
this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity  
brahma created  
vishnu preserved  
and siva destroyed , but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma  
the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate , i'm forced to say it for clarity's sake : a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes , that is , destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics  
your plumber , bonnie and clyde , mickey and mallory , and siva are all productive destroyers  
i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death , presently and historically , than any other phenomena  
muslims kill christians  
hindus kill muslims  
christians kill pagans  
jews kill christians , etc  you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged  
religion is an orgy of killing  
the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn't been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable  
 "" the state is the divine idea upon earth , "" hegel said , meaning it is absolute , all-powerful , ineffable , unassailable , infallible , authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh , allah , god , etc  
well , what does all this have to do with natural born killers ? 
let me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex  
consider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever  
god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc  they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other  
during the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power  
 ( parenthetically , witness plato as well  
in the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime  
not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions  ) 
catholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil  
it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure  
masturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution  
this is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence  
as further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters  
our culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years  
we can't help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self  
mickey and mallory knox internalized them , too , then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other , discovered them , and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves  
it is a straightforward liberation through sex  
as some good patriarch once observed , "" you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on  "" 
m&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions  
they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions  
 "" the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers , "" as mickey says  
as a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter : let us look each other in the face  
we are hyberboreans--we know well enough how remote our place is  
 "" neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans "" : even pindar , in his day , knew that much about us  
beyond the north , beyond ice , beyond death--our life , our happiness     
we have discovered that happiness ; we know the way ; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth  
who else has found it ? --the 
man of today ? -- "" i 
don't know either the way out or the way in ; i am whatever doesn't know either the way out or the way in "" --so sighs the man of today     
this is the sort of modernity that made us ill--we sickened in lazy peace , cowardly compromise , the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay  
this tolerance and largeur of the heart that "" forgives "" everything because it "" understands "" everything is a sirocco to us  
rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds ! 
as far as i can tell , this is what the movie has to say  
its alleged critique of the media is only secondary , tertiary , quaternary , subsidiary for sure  
for example wayne gayle's first report ends with some gen x dude saying , "" if i were a mass murderer i'd be mickey and mallory , "" in his most excellent bill and ted voice  
on one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical , impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes  
it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he'd be just like them , killing and destroying what deserves it  
let me exemplify what i've been saying by analyzing a scene from the film , namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant , kills him , and then castigates him for giving her "" the worst fuckin' head i've ever had in my life ! ! ! "" 
now , i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship , because demonstrably they didn't , and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this "

1,"when i first heard that disney's next animated feature was going to be tarzan , i was almost horrified  
i was worried that disney was going to make another hercules ( sorry , jerk-ules )  
that effort was too overloaded with comedy ( and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero ) , and , after viewing it to this day , i find it a disgrace for disney animation  
when i saw the trailers , i was thinking "" hmm    
this isn't bad at all  
this just might have potential  "" 
when i bought the soundtrack , i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features  
i have never really heard of phil collins , nor have i heard of mark mancina , so i was wondering , how would these two make this disney flick spin ? 
i was pleasantly surprised : the music is top-notch  
phil collins' songs are terrific , percussion-heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs  
the score from mark mancina was also neat ; it reminded me a bit of the lion king , but it was more original  
so , the soundtrack wasn't bad at all , considering it was by two people i am not familiar with  
this film could be good    
but will it be ? 
when i finally went to see it ( on opening day , as i tend to do with most disney animated features ) , my question was answered , in a complete turnabout of expectations for me : disney's tarzan is surprisingly decent  
the story starts out with tarzan's parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace  
however , one day , a vicious leopard , sabor , attacks and kills tarzan's parents , leaving him ( at this time , a baby ) alone-until kala of the apes rescues him  
kala wants to raise the child as her own ( she lost hers previously to sabor ) , but her mate , kerchak is not too sure  
 "" it's not our kind , "" he says  
he agrees , though , to let her take care of little tarzan , but "" that doesn't make him my son  "" 
tarzan grows up , vowing to be "" the best ape ever "" , but no matter how hard he tries or what he does ( at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend , terk ) , he just can't convince kerchak that he is one of the apes , even when he defeats sabor in a battle  
one day , a new animal shows up : humans  
this is where jane comes into the picture  
she is on an expedition with her father ( professor porter ) , and a despicable hunter ( clayton ) searching for gorillas  
tarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons , and soon they get to know each other  
even though tarzan falls in love with jane , this causes things to go wrong  
clayton tricks tarzan into taking him , jane , and porter to see the apes , who are convinced that he has betrayed them  
worse , clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money  
will tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes ? 
i'm not gonna tell you , sorry  
you're gonna have to see for yourself  
and see it you should ; the animation is , as always , top notch , particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees ( read that , skateboarding )  
the deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in  
in fact , it seems similar to the computer imagery/cel animation combination in rival disney animted films , such as fox's anastasia and dreamworks' prince of egypt  
could it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals ? 
the casting is fairly good  
tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan ( and to my relief , the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules  
nicely done ) , and glenn close is wonderful as kala ( she has a beautiful singing voice , too , by the way )  
lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson's beast voice , which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping  
minnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane  
i thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film ( when i first saw the trailers ) , but when i saw the film , i didn't have a problem with her  
i take back my insult on driver  
it's nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature ( he was fflewdurr flamm in disney's most underrated classic , the black cauldron ) ; he is funny and delightful as professor porter  
on the villiany side of the voices , brian blessed ( the guy who did boss nass in star wars : episode i-the phantom menace ) brings a pompous , and later on vicious , voice to the sinister clayton  
he might not be the strongest character in the film ( he's just a plain bad guy , nothing else ) , but blessed's vocal work contributes greatly  
but if there is any voice that i think steals the whole show , it should be rosie o'donnell , who is hilariously funny as terk  
she also has a fiesty attitude ( "" i'm gonna kill ya ! "" 
she says , more than once )  
i almost sung along with her during one of the film's best moments , where the apes make a mess of the human's camp , via song , er , scatting "" shoo-be-doo , da-be-dah ""  
i can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film , she's a good singer  
not that she was the only funny character in the film , though  
wayne knight ( who played stan in space jam ) gives a whimsically funny style to tantor , an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into "" un-sanitary "" water  
 ( thankfully , there is no real sound of flatuence-that would have killed the picture )  
the songs , as i said before , are decent , mostly sung by collins  
this sets a new standard for disney animated films because for the first time , the characters do not sing  
i tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some other guys would , but i found this to be a nice change of pace  
the story does have elements of comedy in it , but they also load it with strong dramatic touches , which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules  
if there is anything disappointing about tarzan , it might be the omission of the 'n sync version of "" trashing the camp "" from the film  
i heard it on the soundtrack , and wondered where it was going to be  
i was upset that it wasn't , because i had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like 'n sync to see tarzan  
oh , well    
overall , i was enthralled with tarzan  
i wouldn't hold it high the way i do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame ( my all-time favorite disney classics ) , but this film deserves a high place among disney's greatest achievements  
i give a nod to disney for following up their spectacular * * * * * masterpiece , mulan , with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough's tarzan "

1,"seen may 19 , 1999 at 5 p  m  at the crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n  y  ) , theater #1 , with my brother john for $8  50  
[theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats , sound and picture] 
 ( critic's note : this review is the longest i've ever written and still only scratches the surface  
i'd recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis  ) 
as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ? 
never mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old  
never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released  
never mind that there's so much going on in this movie in terms of plot , action , special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn't cover everything  
and also like ted does in all of his reviews , i'll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader  
before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film , many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film , skip this and the next four paragraphs )  
as has been made obvious for the last several years , another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars' series ( the first of the films was actually episode four , not one )  
george lucas , the creator of the series , has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , ' `the empire strikes back' and `return of the jedi' ) is actually the second trilogy , chronologically  
in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can't recall his reasons  
with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err    
second trilogy    
well you know what i mean )  
and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which , unfortunately , may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution  
[critic's note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed , but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule  
critic's note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics' law of reviewing movies , which as roger ebert coined , `it's not what a movie is about , but how it is about it  ' 
because so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story  ] 
first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it  
we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire  
we know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side  ' 
we also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi )  
what we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth  
to me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity  
also , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended  
most notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine  
for those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least )  
with `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights  
unfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained  
i didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness  
if you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? )  
but i digress  
i've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself  
all these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself  
what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s  
its similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality  
the basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times  
we're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo  
we're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly  
we're introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor )  
the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen , amidala ( portman )  
the leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears  
he is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series  
sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person  
clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers  
i have a feeling we'll delve into his background in the next two films )  
but it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along  
the film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another  
there are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook  
the other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting  
the sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits  
as we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story  
and here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council  
to briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala's spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation  
their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force  
jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves "
1,"i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video  
it really scared me , and i didn't want to go see it  
however , after i heard about how wonderful it was , i wanted to see it  
i didn't get a chance to do so , until now  
the film , disney's 25th animated feature , opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale : a long time ago in the land of prydain , there was a king so evil , that his spirit was captured in the cauldron  
it has been hidden for centuries , and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors , and with them rule the world ? and destroy it  
then , we meet a farmer-wizard , dallben , and his young apprentice , taran  
taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a `pig-keeper' ( they have a pig named hen-wen )  
one day , as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath , the pig goes crazy , and dallben then realizes , after watching hen wen's thoughts through a bucket of water , that taran must hide hen wen in the forest  
an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron , and only hen wen has the power to show its location  
taran leads hen wen into the forest , but of course , he loses her , and tries to go find her  
along the way , he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi , who desires `munchings and crunchings' , much to his dismay ( besides , he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen )  
when he hears hen wen's squeal from far away , though , he races to her rescue ? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants  
taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king's castle from far away  
taran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen  
he manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon  
there , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls  
along the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie  
the three manage to escape the horned king's castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic  
as they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen's trail  
he leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of `pig tracks' , to a whirlpool  
suddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy-like fairfolk  
taran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva  
he then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world  
with the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage  
it turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place  
when taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ? in exchange for his sword  
taran agrees , much to eilonwy's horror , but at least they get the black cauldron  
but ? the cauldron can't be destroyed , only its evil powers can be stopped  
the only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive  
things take a turn for the worse when the horned king's henchmen capture taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr , along with the black cauldron , and lead them back to the castle  
taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors ( this is the most horrifying scene in the film , because here , a dead army comes alive ? )  
just when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr  
taran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away  
gurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay  
taran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king  
he kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely  
taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king's castle just as it self-destructs  
the witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they `never give anything away , they bargain'  
in response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi  
the trade is made ; gurgi's seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group  
as taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs-he is not dead after all ! 
the happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return  
as spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times  
before ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions , he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron , a sword and sorcery tale for the studio  
bringing this book to the screen was the studio's fondest dream  
miller , who entitled himself as the executive producer , promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects  
when micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio , the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron  
by this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department  
many of the studio's old men had retired or died  
therefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film  
originally budgeted at $25 million , the costs raised to $40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped  
the film was rated pg and the film , although `disneyfied' from lloyd alexander's chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney's other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it  
in addition , other critics rejected it for having `no heart' and `unmemorable' , compared to other disney animated features  
but whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $21 million  
the failure of the film grounded the studio's animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio's reputation  
the next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , didn't do much better ( although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective )  
only with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features  
as for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron  
finally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released  
because of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ? 
the people who had seen the film didn't think so  
in fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it  
for a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom  
few people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who hadn't seen the film yet ( i am included here ) , they got quite a treat  
but people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g )  
somewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , `bring back the black cauldron ! ' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states "

1,"vannesa kensington : `austin , do you smoke after sex ? ' austin powers : `i don't know baby , i've never looked ! ' 
and so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer season  
austin powers 2 , the sequel to the sleeper hit of 1997 , is filled to the brim with uproarious sight gags and lurid toilet jokes that will make you keel over with hilarity  
the mind of mike myers is obviously a very bizarre place  
myers returns as the swinging 60's spy and his arch-nemesis , the bald headed dr  evil , who is given much of the spotlight here  
there's an early scene in which dr  evil and his son scott ( seth green ) appear on a jerry springer segment entitled `my dad is evil and wants to take over the world' , hosted by springer himself  
most of these talk-show gags , spoofing everything from oprah to regis and kathie lee , are no longer as funny as they once were  
happily , this is an exception , especially when a fight breaks out between dr  evil and the other guests  
 ( sample dialogue- `come back here you mother #@%$^ ! ! 
you want a piece of me ? ' ) 
the audience was in stitches  
there are many good things about this sequel  
dr  evil is now assisted by mini-me ( verne troyer ) , a pint-sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry  
mini-me is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for , and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does , pinkie and all  
mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina , evil's loud-mouth assassin sidekick , and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber  
this works surprisingly well  
afterward , there's even a meeting at the coffee machine , where their awkwardness is expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment  
oh , yes    
the plot  
after a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington ( elizabeth hurley ) that goes disastrously wrong , powers is back on the case to thwart the diabolical plans of dr  evil  
in the original , the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods  
here , it's time travel  
dr  evil has this crazy plan to steal austin's mojo ( the source of his sexual powers ) , so he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when powers is still is his freezing chamber  
there , he employs a grotesque 600-pound scottish assassin named fat bastard ( also myers ) to commandeer the mojo , so that our future hero is left completely shagless  
meanwhile , austin is informed of evil's wrong-doing by basil exposition ( michael york ) , and is supplied with his very own time-traveling device in the form of a volkswagen beetle  
once back in 1969 , powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell ( heather graham ) , and learns of dr  evil's plans to destroy washington dc with a lazer on the moon  
in one of the many uproarious jabs at star wars , evil calls the moon base a `death star'  
if there ever was a movie that knew from the start it was a complete joke , it's austin powers : the spy who shagged me  
ap2 has many hilarious moments , much more so , than the original austin powers  
but what it doesn't have is the confident support system that the first boasted , and the jokes are now more scattershot and hit-and-miss  
while myers has a knack for delivering clever , inspired gags , he sometimes doesn't know when to call it quits  
the hilarious scene in the original involving mustafa ( will ferrell ) and his refusal to die is played out here in a disappointing and tired manner  
robert wagner , as dr  evil's #2 man , has only one scene early on in the film , where he lacks all the focus of the character  
one nice surprise is rob lowe , as the young #2 , who patterns wagner's voice and movements right down to a tee  
there are more recycled jokes from the predecessor , including kristen johnston as ivana humpalot ( an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina )  
but myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project , and many bits are side-splittingly funny  
don't miss an extended visual gag in a tent , where the shadows leave much to the imagination     
of the new characters , graham doesn't leave much of an impression  
her performance is merely okay , and she lacks the gung-ho enthusiasm that made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her  
and as for fat bastard    
well , he provides one or two hilarious moments , but all of the obesity jokes and bathroom talk go too far  
but my most severe complaint : mr  bigglesworth was only in one scene ! ! 
but , with gritted teeth , i managed to get over that  
this sequel will not leave fans disappointed ; it's more often than not a laugh riot  
and , i look optimistically to the future , where i foresee more installments to the austin powers collection  
if myers can up the quota of fresh ideas , we should be in store for much more

all recipes are fictions  
twentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism  
a psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul ! 
director/writer antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts , but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves   
 ""   they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive   "" 
this true story , briefly mentioned in "" the shining "" , has no turned into a 143 minutes long motion picture  
in 1847 , the united states was a land of pioneers , of gold-starved americans making their way west  
it was a period of manifest destiny , the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries , stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could  
capt  john boyd ( guy pearce ) has become both a "" hero "" and a victim during this period of relentless consumption    
in ways he could never have imagined  
boyd's journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific mexican-american war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost , a waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california  
upon his arrival he is greeted by a small , motley group of soldiers , including his commanding officer , hart ( jeffrey jones ) , a previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life ; toffler ( jeremy davies ) , the fort's personal emissary to the lord ; knox ( stephen spinella ) , the veterinarian that plays doctor , who never met a bottle of whiskey he didn't like ; reich ( neal mcdonough ) , the no-nonsense soldier of the group ; and the seriously "" over-medicated "" cleaves ( david arquette ) , a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions  
into this cold , bleak and bizarre world staggers a stranger , colqhoun ( robert carlyle ) , a half-starved scot who had been traveling with a group of settlers until they became snowbound  
seeking refuge in a cave , they soon ran out of food - and were forced to consume one another  
colqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors d'oeuvre himself  
our heroes then decide to journey through the mountains to find the survivors , and colqhoun tags along to help out  
soon it becomes clear that colqhoun's tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will to survive  
it involves an old indian myth called weendigo , which states that a man who eats the flesh of another steals that person's strength , spirit and very essence  
his hunger becomes an insatiable craving : the more he eats , the more he wants , and the stronger he becomes  
there can never be enough , and death is the only escape   
it's all fairly sickening and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the whole movie through  
as professionally made as the movie is , you have to wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this  
teen-age horror fans won't care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell  
older folks might show up when they hear that the movie is actually a satire about the pioneer spirit , but they'll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces  
but jokes aside , this is a film that is well worth watching  
it has wonderful and mature characters , that few horror film s can boast of and a strangely effective story that continues to electrify you till the end  
the two main characters are also the most interesting  
boyd is a simple , honest man tiered of war , killing and fear  
his sacred wish is to live a normal , quite life away from gunpowder and blood  
colqhoun is different  
he proves that a man , on the brink of death , would do anything to stay alive , including sacrificing his own soul  
he believes so much in this indian myth that he starts to change physically  
it is the power of the human mind and conviction that make miracles happen  
the atmosphere in "" ravenous "" is macabre and bizarre , scary and surreal  
completely isolated from the rest of the world , stands fort spencer  
here time stands still , and nothing changes  
the inhabitants are soldiers driven by war and pillage  
they are all somehow losers of society that have been banished -- men that are used to killing and have not done anything else in their entire life  
men that are nothing , and has nothing to loose  
the result is some sort of cabin fever  
cannibalism is more like a sick game for them  
since they find no pleasure in living , they find some excitement in killing and dying  
it's like "" who's going to die first ? "" 
the unchangeable icy landscape , where birds do not sing and even wind doesn't move the leaves on the trees , resembles kubrick's "" the shining ""  
it's hard to not get mad here ! 
one of the scary aspects of the film is a strange connection that the viewer establishes with the characters , and starts to understand them , although they have turned into half crazed killers  
music is another factor that strengthens the atmosphere  
a strange musical score , composed by michael nyman ( the piano ) and damon albarn , that often seems out of place , and in complete contrast to the image , somehow reflects the characters' twisted reactions on the world and their situation  
the director herself stated that it was "" ok to laugh "" during the picture  
and i must admit that it is often very funny , in a strange way ( such as the wonderful quote : ""   it's 
lonely being a cannibal  
you don't get that many friends    "" 
or when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin , saying "" eat to live  
don't live to eat  "" )  but 
mostly it is frightening and shocking as it goes deeper into the minds of these strange men and we witness their psychological change "

1,"let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films  
i'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years  
i'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film  
by that point , it was evident that mr  bond was back with a vengeance  
all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience  
it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts  
it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in  
i guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain  
anyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond  
i think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films  
there were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined  
and bond's last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series  
the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series  
everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007  
for the most part , the action sequences worked very well  
although , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film  
i think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted  
while he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film  
most noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie  
he almost seemed like he didn't know what he was doing  
but they were brief scenes and really shouldn't take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing  
if you have ever seen a bond film , you won't be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit  
the world is not enough is no exception  
this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world  
007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain  
why this point is included is beyond me  
they took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought  
anyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid-east oil pipeline  
i guess world domination just isn't as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore  
bond is brought in to protect the pipeline's owner , elektra king ( sophie marceau ) , who is the daughter of one of renard's recent victims  
along the way , bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist , dr  christmas jones ( denise richards ) , and his old rival valentin zukovsky ( robert carlyle )  
like all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words  
my biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films  
there was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing  
the buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau's character  
it was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film  
later , it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something  
but because it is a bond film , the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly  
after all , it isn't shakespeare  
how about the cast ? 
brosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007  
i grew up with the roger moore version of bond , so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character  
judi dench , as m , had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role  
she brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner  
robbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye , so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie  
coltrane gets more screen time , which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes  
then there are the bond girls  
sophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today  
there is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim  
those that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face  
marceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest  
then we have denise richards  
there was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks  
and after you see the outfits she wears , you won't have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer's eyes  
i was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist  
admittedly , there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue , but other than that she stacks up ( no pun intended ) to her bond girl predecessors nicely  
i must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle's character  
while carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had , his character just never worked for me  
the producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character , but it just never quite got off the ground  
i guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character , but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character  
this might have worked well in another movie , but i don't go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations  
last , but not least , we have desmond llewelyn as q  this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bond's gadget guy , and he is as good as ever  
although his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films , he is still a treat to watch "

1,"one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable  
you know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is  
sure , it's been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch  
this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun  
one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story  
this rule applies highly to kiss the girls  
there is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made  
however , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through  
well , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up  
unfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits  
that may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery  
however , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film  
plotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality  
we are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero  
he gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself  
obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene  
at his house , cross is told that his neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been missing for four days  
this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can't sympathize with detective cross  
however , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees    
before she is abducted  
dr  kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd family ) is a smart , athletic woman , and because of these traits , becomes a target for casanova--what the serial killer likes to call himself  
because of these character-developing scenes , we care for mctiernan , making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful  
after being abducted , mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods  
remembering that the killer gave her certain rules , she decides to break one of them by calling out  
when casanova comes to punish her , she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall  
after she is found , she begins to help cross find his neice  
from this moment on , kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film , as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive  
many people will compare this film to 1995's seven , another killer film starring morgan freeman , but i presume that the similarities are intentional  
the screenplay , by david klass , is adapted from the novel written by james patterson , and yet i don't quite see how this story could have worked in novel form  
what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness  
the cinematography , by aaron schneider , is reminiscient of seven , and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us  
sometimes a simple shot is the best one  
however , many of the shots are stunning , and unlike seven , most of them take place during the day , in sunlight  
the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done , in more than one way  
the camera work is terrific , but the editing makes this scene work so well  
the chaotic and mtv-type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness , exactly what judd's character is experiencing  
however , the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors  
morgan freeman is one of today's most powerful and believable actors  
detective cross is a very good character for him , although it is just a similar one to the character in seven  
because of freeman's powerful presence , he carries half the film by himself  
the other half is carried by ashley judd , one of today's most promising dramatic actresses  
in fact , her performance is better than freeman's , if that is even possible  
her character is more original than freeman's , and she handles it wonderfully  
we finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream  
the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped , but the cast members do as much as they can with it  
cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina , and unfortunately has scraps for a character  
tony goldwyn fairs slightly better , but we don't really get to know his character either  
gina ravera gives a good performance , but again she isn't in many of the scenes  
so as a result of all these small supporting parts , the weight of the film lies on the two leads , and they do a phenomenal job  
some of the best acting of this genre , and some of the best acting of the year  
two other essential aspects of the film are quite good  
director gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors , but the second half of the film loses believability , especially during the revelation of the killer  
he also doesn't handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have , losing a lot of tension during many scenes  
however , to his credit , he does manage a terrific first half  
part of the blame falls on david klass  
i'm sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more , but klass focuses on the two main parts  
while this may give the two leads more screentime , many of the small characters are one-dimensional , and the killer , when revealed , is extremely implausible  
thanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel , kiss the girls always seems intelligent  
none of the conversations are laughable , and all move the plot forward without seeming forced  
one of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer  
i blame this mainly on the casting director , because the killer's motive is because of rejection from women ( or so i assume from the opening monologue ) , but the killer himself is very attractive ( one of my friends is a , shall we say , big admirer of the killer )  
kiss the girls is rated r for terror , violence , language , and suggested sex "

produced by bruce cohen & dan jinks written by alan ball directed by sam mendes 
 "" both my wife and daughter think i'm this gigantic loser  
and they're right  
i have lost something  
i didn't always feel this sedated  "" 
with that piece of dialogue , we are fully introduced to lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) , a 42 year old man trapped within his own life  
lester works for an advertising agency  
his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid-life crisis he is suffering  
estranged from both his wife and his daughter , lester starts to crack under the stress  
his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies , and sullen apathy  
carolyn burnham ( annette bening ) , is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker  
she carefully tends her rose garden , decorates her home with the best furnishings  
but inside she is desperate  
unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent , she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family  
the third member of this anti-family is jane burnham ( thora birch ) , lester and carolyn's daughter  
a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence , but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction  
this funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple  
not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her  
some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters  
most notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney ) , the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts  
she has almost no dialogue , and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one  
colonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man  
his rage directed almost singularly at his son , ricky ( wes bentley ) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham's  
in fact they are the next door neighbors  
anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in "" american beauty ""  
alan ball , who was the co-executive producer of the hit tv series "" cybil "" and creator of the new sitcom "" oh grow up "" , has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years  
not one character in this film rings falsely  
and the depth of personality in each , is achingly honest and insightful  
the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as "" the graduate "" or "" lolita ""  
kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances  
his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age  
finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become , lester tries to return to his youth  
he quits his job ( actually blackmailing his employer for one year's salary ) , starts smoking pot , fantasizes about his daughter's girlfriend angela ( mena suvari , in a marvelous performance here ) , starts working out , and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet  
mr  spacey's performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous , that we can be certain that come oscar ? time , we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees  
annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career  
carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy  
unable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder  
ms  bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone  
the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words  
thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her  
jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family , and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment  
her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning  
she is the prototypical trophy child  
when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team ( "" i'm so proud of you , honey  
you didn't screw up once ! "" ) , the bitterness and resentment are palpable  
thora birch is a young actress to watch  
praise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance  
colonel finn is a man in complete denial  
his military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend  
wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma  
the boy next door who may be more foe than friend  
a deceitful and calculating young man , whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him  
mr  bentley's performance is the one troublesome note in the film  
that is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar , that one almost faults the performance for it  
director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle  
scenes of carolyn walking through the rain , carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character  
the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful , capturing the season in all of it's harsh beauty ( fall has never looked so inviting , yet depressing )  
every nuance of "" american beauty "" begs it's audience to think and examine  
it is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come "

1,"warning : this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film "" fail-safe  "" 
if you haven't seen the film yet , proceed with caution  
nutshell : a relevant , intelligent , suspenseful drama  
still powerful today , even after the end of the cold war  
-------------------- "" fail-safe "" ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes 
screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e  youngstein directed by sidney lumet 
review by jamahl epsicokhan -------------------- 
the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn't have a winning side and a losing side  
in a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world--assuming the world survives  
the idea--and perhaps the only real option--is to avoid war at all costs  
this is the theme of sidney lumet's "" fail-safe , "" a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler  
 "" fail-safe "" takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism  
the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws  
five u  s  bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america  
the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers  
suddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike  
a great deal of "" fail-safe "" 's plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u  s  bombers from reaching russia's borders--at any cost  
the plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios  
the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails  
general bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable  
the events in "" fail-safe "" are fascinating because they're anything but predictable , but the real reason "" fail-safe "" works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot  
a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states' role in all of it  
most of this is through the film's use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president's advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war  
many of the film's most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices  
early in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of "" strategy "" in a nuclear assault to "" minimize "" casualties  
 "" what's the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? "" 
a guest asks impatiently  
 "" forty million , "" groeteschele responds wryly  
the problem with groeteschele's mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war  
the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals  
groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over  
yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o'herlihy ) has often recommended  
on the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u  s  , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage  
such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race  
 "" fail-safe "" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film  
why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ? 
is it wise ? 
is it even logical ? 
no , not really  
although "" fail-safe "" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way  
again , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film's most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance  
in addition to providing the central "" pro-nuclear war "" voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism  
the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib  
one of groeteschele's "" logical "" trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it's merely absurd  
he labels the average marxist an "" unfeeling , calculating machine "" that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself  
groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u  s  drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia's home soil--which must be preserved at all costs  
groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would  
the irony here is groeteschele's own mechanical theorizing  
he is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn't even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns  
once the film makes it evident that turning the u  s  bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be  
just how will the soviet union's leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ? 
 ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? ) 
with the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet's long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader  
without getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances  
 ( that is , as sensible as a nuclear "" incident "" can probably be  ) 
it does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all-out war , something that simply isn't possible because of its all-too-real consequences  
dramatically , the ending is quite powerful , and the use of o'herlihy's character as the symbolic "" matador "" ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film's opening ) , is particularly appropriate  
 "" fail-safe "" is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high-tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film  
nevertheless , under lumet's direction and walter bernstein's intelligent adaptation of burdick's and wheeler's novel , the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded  
the film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming  
but it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that "" fail-safe "" also finds dangerous  
in retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century  
it's just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele's dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown "

1,"as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it , the more pleased i was when i left  
first , getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz : "" if you liked scream , you'll love wild things ! "" 
 "" campbell gives a stunning performance ! "" 
 "" this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days ! "" 
 ( oh yeah , the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me ) 
now , onto more serious stuff ( and with this film , i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way )  
wild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa  
i'm not saying that in a bad way , but when you see this film , you may be shocked by what you see  
however , perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film's charming cast and tricky plot , that they let the film slide with an r rating  
being mormon , i'm bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film  
trouble is , i have already seen it  
and i like it ! 
wild things is a film noir of the 90s , filled with 40s sensibilities , and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture  
the style in which it is filmed is rich in color  
the actors are all gorgeous people , seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film  
sure , it's all too good to be true , but ain't it fun to watch ? 
when movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it  
there will be people who don't want to admit liking what they see , but i tell you , most anyone who sees this will like it  
wild things begins at blue bay high school , the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into  
it's almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone )  
of course , there are those select few who may look slightly ugly , but compared to the average person , they are gorgeous  
immediately , the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time  
we can turn off our brains , right ? 
wrong  
while you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn't turn out that way  
the film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present  
there's sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students  
he's heading the class discussion  
there's also kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam  
teaching the class , however , are two policemen : ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) , who want to talk about 'sex    
 ( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) '  
 "" what is a sex crime ? "" 
ray asks  
 "" not gettin' any ! "" 
one student responds  
this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch  
however , upon hearing this , one student , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , stands up and leaves the room , commenting that they can both kiss part of her body  
and so , wild things sets into motion  
quickly , kelly begins hitting on sam , but sam doesn't want anything to do with her advances  
kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him  
she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep  
surprisingly , that's really all i can tell you about the plot  
any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists  
and what's more , these plot twists are actually unpredictable  
going along the way of scream , wild things maintains that film's surprises , and then adds even more to them  
there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen  
and even though you think you may get tired of them , the surprises are so genuine that it's rather pleasing  
going back over them in my mind , nearly all of them work , though some stretch the boundaries of belief  
thankfully , the convoluted plot doesn't give us much time to think about each one , pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off  
as for the critics who complain that the film is trashy--well , it is  
this is pretty much just one trashy film  
however , it is the kind of trashy that isn't hard to watch  
it's good trash , in a sense  
one , the screenplay knows that it's not to be taken seriously , and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story  
this varies everywhere from kelly's mother ( theresa russell ) , who is more of a caricature of rich people , all the way to an ambulance-chasing lawyer ( bill murray ) , who wears a neck-brace to cover an insurance scam he is running  
bill murray also provides the best character in the film , and most of the genuine laughs  
and two , the sex is more than gratuitous , although not unwelcomed  
wild things is supposed to have sex in it ( what film with that title wouldn't ? ) , and this movie breaks the boundaries  
instead of having heterosexual sex scenes , it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell ( don't worry    
it's not as graphic as you might think )  
the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic , but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon's full-frontal nude scene  
it's very brief , so if you blink , you may miss ( ahem ) it  
and , for as long as i can remember , i don't think i have seen an r-rated film show an erect one before ( it's not completely , but judging from the audiences' reaction , it was more than they expected too )  
also , during one scene late in the film , there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon's characters , but nothing came of it ( makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating , or if the actors refused to do it )  
what first made me want to see wild things was its cast  
neve campbell , of course , has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released  
here , however , she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead  
the closest role to this was her performance in the craft ( though even in that she was a nice girl )  
campbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent  
you can tell she will be around for a long time "

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
like its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent  
a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking  
the film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop  
as boogie nights opens , he's toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity  
recruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar  
wholeheartedly embraced by jack's troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c  reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his "" one special thing "" are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a "" big bright shining star ""  
his lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in  
the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr  anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious  
from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr  anderson's accomplished command of the camera is without question  
while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco's unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr  anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent  
it's a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker's career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it's somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he's clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he's borrowing from some of the best , and it's entirely effective within the context of this film  
while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it's also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour  
the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre-aids-scare period in american history where uninhibited , free-wheeling lifestyles abounded  
while much of the film's humour pertains to the characters' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope's demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get 'freaky deaky' with the music -- it's elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous  
a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie/dirk's bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking  
ably supported by a well-selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr  anderson's personal collection ) , there's a clear affection for the era in boogie nights  
it's the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film's promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters  
after the debacle with 1996's milos forman film , the people vs  
larry flynt , another finely-crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography-related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public  
however , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it's hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there's very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business  
the glimpses on the sets of jack horner's shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there's a candid matter-of-factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it's refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided  
if anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves  
jack horner's dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence )  
in both films , the world of quickie low-budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack's retort of "" there are shadows in light , baby "" to his cinematographer's complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood's "" it's not about the little details , it's about the big picture ! "" 
rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false  
in boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there's nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an 'artistic' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark  
much like the humour lacing ed wood , the laughs involving jack horner are double-edged ; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres , when jack breathes "" this is the best work i've ever done "" , it's genuinely funny , but given his utter sincerity , also possesses a tinge of sadness  
mr  anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter  
while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn't any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film's characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film's * protagonist * literally doesn't say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it's no wonder why the playfully inane "" how much can you bench ? "" 
banter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film's finest exchanges  
and while mr  anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it's problematic that some of the the threads given to the film's characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore's child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv-movie version of her character's story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions  
still , even if he doesn't always know what to do with his characters , mr  anderson most definitely captures their essences , and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious -- misguided , even aimless , hopelessly naive , self-destructive , insufferable : i loved them just the same  
in any case , it's hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired ( and ultimately best-executed ) scenes of the year : a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose-cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson ( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance , even if it's a small one ) in a suicidal drug deal scam , only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric ( the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger's "" sister christian "" on his stereo system is sheer brilliance ) flanked by an armed bodyguard  
if this scene already wasn't tense enough with these elements , mr  anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene , who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room , pushing the scene to a new , surreal level of delightful giddiness  
there are some other interesting touches in boogie nights  
mr  anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight ; here , it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect  
similarly , a painful scene where crew member scotty j ( philip seymour hoffman ) breaks down in tears in the driver's seat , sobbing "" i'm so stupid "" after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver's seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening  
boogie nights is exceedingly well cast , and each of the actors rise to the occasion ; the ensemble cast is uniformly good  
while most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr  wahlberg ( fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films ) and mr  reynolds ( terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film , ringing true in every respect ) , a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention  
mr  reilly demonstrates here , as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard's georgia , a genuine aptitude for comedy -- many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film  
i'm not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot , but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee  
mr  reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number , and it's wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation  
worth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad ( and dead-on period ; it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me ) demo track "" you got the touch "" in a vain attempt at a musical career  
mr  reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective  
ms  graham , with her long dirty blonde hair , innocent demeanour , and huge hazel eyes , looks like a disney animated heroine come to life -- or in this case , a disney animated heroine who came to life , made a wrong turn , and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s / early 80s adult film industry  
consequently , it's a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet-faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates , but in a scene where she's lounging in a limousine prowling the streets , garish red lipstick messily smeared on , giving the camera a hilariously pouty come-hither look , all one can do is gulp  
her role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out ( err -- in a figurative sense ) -- she's essentially a glorified extra -- but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity  
 ( if only mr  anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face , though ! ) 
and a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish : as a teen , ms "

it's not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film , but i'd like to think that i'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time  
recently , i've seen the films of hitchcock , capra , fellini , godard , kurosawa , chaplin , lang , and many others  
 ? those men were talented artists , and their films reflect their genius  ? 
they are likely to be remembered for  
  
  
well , quite a while  ? 
i like this film , too  ? 
yes , it's a disaster-slash-action movie  ? 
true , its budget is a lot more money than i'll ever see in my lifetime  ? 
and there's not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money  ? 
in fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would've been more profitable  
i certainly don't care what their intentions were , because michael bay ( the rock ) is such a skilled director that i doubt he'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through  
of course , skillful direction doesn't complete the package , but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together  
the story is well-thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) , the acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters  
yes , you read that right  
armageddon actually has characters you can care about ! 
if you don't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be  
if you've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story  
it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film  
so , it's up to the u  s  government to stop it  
 ( why the u  s  is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated  ) 
their plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within  
the head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis )  
his group of men is a colorful bunch , including a  j  
 ( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi )  
there's also an interesting triangle formed between a  j  , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry's daughter  
a  j  
and grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad isn't too happy with the situation  
it's absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you'd like to call armageddon  
it's not about story -- it's about viscera and action , and thrills-a-minute , and all that stuff  
it's incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds' thought to what actually happens  
but bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better  
i think most of the budget went to cameras alone , because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles  
take the spectacular opening scene , for instance , in which a meteor shower obliterates new york  
a meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building , which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars  
the action itself might take five seconds in real life , but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways  
i like his quick-edit style , because it's abrasive and exhausting to watch  
it's also very loud , and obnoxiously noisy at times  
but it's fun to be obnoxious sometimes  
the special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame  
deep impact , visually , has absolutely nothing on armageddon , and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable  
special effects are very important in a film like this : if they're not good , then the image is not convincing , and the film doesn't work  
everything here looks bright and explosive -- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers , all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid  
the effects that don't look totally real are still a pleasure to behold , and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice-looking that it actually qualifies as art  
of course , all of this would add up to little more than an above-average light show , if i didn't get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action  
the film is two and a half hours long , and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action  
much of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters' subplots  
i won't suggest that these are complex characters , but their problems are real , and the emotions aren't put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way  
in fact , there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up , and that's a lot more than i can say about deep impact , which was banking on the feel-good parts of its story  
bruce willis is terrific , and i'm glad to see him bigger than life again ( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing )  
tyler and affleck are great together , and make a convincing couple -- all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level  
patton , who is a magnificent actor , thankfully is not wasted here , and the minor subplot revolving around his ex-wife and son is very moving  
the comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare ( who plays a crazy russian astronaut ) is nifty , and keeps the film lively and funny  
i wasn't challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon , and i don't mind too much  
but the film doesn't insult my intelligence -- it's pitched perfectly to entertain , which is what all it really wants to do  
it's not mindless and escapist , but well-crafted cinema "

1,"with the release of gattaca , i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens , or aliens in general  
hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films , but what was usually lacking was a good story    
and good characters    
and good acting , etc ( contact being the exception )  
and for some reason , hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth  
the closest , that i have seen anyway , was 2001 : a space odyssey , which made mankind an alien race themselves , being dwarfed by the technology which they created  
now comes gattaca , another film about technology reigning supreme , except here on our planet  
the difference between 2001 and this one is simple : gattaca is more frightening  
most of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering  
using this premise , writer/director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills  
unfortunately , due to a lack of advertising , i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office  
since seeing the film , i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca  
lately , however , i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca  
most people don't even realize that it is a film  
despite this fact , i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it  
niccol's film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter , better produced , and more realistic  
gattaca begins in the 21st century  
procreating is now done in a petri dish , and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it  
natural child birth is considered old-fashioned  
we are introduced to jerome morrow ( ethan hawke ) , an employee of the gattaca space program  
one of the directors of the program has been murdered , and the main suspect is one vincent freeman  
the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman  
vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love  
however , after his birth , and through several genetic tests , doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99% chance of a weak heart , as well as poor eye sight and a short life span  
as a result , both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics  
anton ( loren dean ) is produced without flaws , and the competition between brothers spawns  
vincent has a dream to fly a solo-flight around the titan , the 14th moon of saturn , but because of his condition , gattaca , and society in general , forces him to do menial labor around the company  
labeled an "" in-valid , "" vincent's dream seems impossible , until he meets a black-market dna specialist , german ( tony shalhoub )  
german introduces him to a "" valid "" who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident  
jerome morrow ( jude law ) agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools ( urine , blood , skin and hair samples , etc  ) that he will need to get past gattaca's tight security  
in exchange , vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship  
after the murder , however , his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincent's eyelashes left at the scene of the crime  
irene cassini ( uma thurman ) is a genetically flawed "" valid "" working for gattaca , and she begins to fall in love with vincent/jerome  
gattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time  
only two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years ( contact and the arrival ) and gattaca will rank among them  
unfortunately , whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effects-laden films , it normally gets buried  
the second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs  
the orange glow of gattaca's scenes are impressive , but the sets deserve most of the credit  
the sets are very well done , creating a futuristic sense , but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers  
as we look at the designs , we realize that these buildings aren't too far into the future  
this brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day  
the best thing , however , is the plot  
the story is more than your average sci-fi/thriller  
at its heart , it develops a theme which is never overpowering but is always present  
perhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring  
would our society become a bunch of soulless zombies ? 
maybe human nature is a result of mankind's flaws  
if we get rid of flaws , do we get rid of dreams as well ? 
niccol's intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well , and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against a dramatic story , or vice versa  
the power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters  
while flat may sound like a poor job on niccol's part , it actually enhances the meaning behind the story  
ethan hawke has developed into a handsome adult actor , giving his best performance of his lifetime so far  
his curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and "" valid "" peers  
uma thurman is    well , uma thurman  
her character is slightly underdeveloped , but the story isn't about her  
however , thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat character  
jude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character  
he provides several nice touches , and his final scene is a very touching and heartwrenching one  
loren dean gives a nice performance in his well-developed character "

rated pg-13 for mild language , adult situations , drug use , martial art action and violence  
107 minutes  
super 35mm / panavision ( 2  35 : 1 ) 
what can you say about jackie chan that hasn't already been said  
since the release of 'rumble in the bronx "" back in 1996 ( the u  s  release ) , jackie has become a fairly recognizable commodity on america's video shelves  
having made over 80 films , jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of action-comedy to the west  
his latest release , "" shanghai noon "" , is a joyful tribute / spoof of the classic western  
and by adding jackie chan into the genre , the tag line for the film ( "" the western gets a kick in the pants "" ) rings true  
jackie stars as chon wang , a lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china  
the royal princess pei pei ( lucy liu ) is set to be married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture  
unwilling to follow her father's wishes , princess pei pei with the assistance of her english tutor , decides to escape to america  
but this is all a ploy devised by exiled guard lo fong , which will lead to the princess' kidnapping and ransom  
unable to take any legal action , the ransom demands are met and three of the forbidden city's bravest guards ( played by cui ya hi , rong guang yu , and eric chen ) are ordered to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson city , nevada  
chon wang pleads with the imperial court and is given permission to join the team , as he is looked upon as a buffoon  
on a train in the u  s  jackie meets up with bandit roy o'bannon ( owen wilson )  
he is much less of a bandit than he is a glory hog , looking simple for the notoriety and fame that being a bandit will bring him  
with his gang in tow , roy attempts to rob the train , when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court , who also happens to be chon wang's uncle  
chon wang gives chase , foiling the attempted robbery , but also leaving himself stranded in the desert  
as the disgraced guard wanders through the desert , he again comes upon roy , who has been left for dead by his former gang  
buried up to his neck in the desert , roy pleads with chon to dig him out  
chon demands to know where carson city is  
roy directs him , and chon leaves  
but not before sticking two chopsticks into roy's mouth and telling him to dig himself  
chon soon finds himself confronted by angry crow warriors , a friendly sioux tribe , gunslingers , a horse that thinks and behaves like a dog and an indian bride ( brandon merrill ) , before once again running into roy  
 "" shanghai noon "" is just good fun  
the chemistry between the cast is remarkable  
the performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film  
jackie's performance is as good as anything he's done before  
he's not called on to do much acting here , as the character is not written with any depth  
but jackie's natural charisma shines through , and his comic timing is so perfect , both physically and ( surprise ) verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on  
owen wilson , last seen in the embarrassing remake of "" the haunting "" , gives a good natured performance as roy o'bannon  
his innocence is refreshing and fun  
a bad guy that's not really bad  
his scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis  
lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script , but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant  
the character is a noble woman of status and wealth , but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment  
the rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances  
nothing here is realistic , mind you  
 "" shanghai noon "" is first and foremost a light , jovial film  
and the performances match that style with ease  
the cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous  
using calgary , alberta as the prime location  
mr  mindel is able to create a lush , romantic western feel to the film  
nothing here really looks like nevada , but the locations are so beautifully shot and staged , the film can be looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre  
and as such , the script by alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose with history , but with reverence to past films  
homage to such films as "" high noon "" ( obviously ) , "" red river "" and most notably "" butch cassidy & the sundance kid "" all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film  
it is a comforting experience  
at a time when the western is considered either old hat or irrelevant , here is a film that embraces those old attitudes and ( dare i say ) clich ? s and manages to make them palatable and refreshing  
here is a film that is not contemptuous of the genre  
this is the purest "" horse opera "" since the days of george o'brian or john wayne  
director tom dey has crafted a loving tribute to hollywood's past  
in this , his first film mr  dey shows both a love of character and of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see  
nothing here really stands out , or takes one's attention away from the story or action  
and that is as it should be , when jackie chan is your star  
and what of the action and stunts  
well , while not up to a level of "" drunken master 2 "" or any of jackie's hong kong films , "" shanghai noon "" is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american film before  
his timing , choreography , and creativity are still as sharp as ever  
jackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films ( obvious to those of us that have seen those films , but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar )  
finally jackie can honestly say , that he has made an u "

1," ""   it's certainly more than just a monster story   "" 
- kenneth branagh , director/actor/co-writer of mary shelley's frankenstein  
kenneth branagh's new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein-films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world , including the most controversial version of them all - directed by james whale  
the dark and stormy nights , the lightning bolts , the charnel houses of spare body parts , the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful  
but the center of the film , quieter and more thoughtful , contains the real story  
horror-fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror  
branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues : morality , philosophy and human elements of the story , and not on old fashioned horror cliches  
his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel  
the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean  
the year is 1794  
a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters  
his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs  
as the ice closes around his ship , a figure appears on the horizon  
it's a man  
exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew  
his name is victor frankenstein ( kenneth branagh ) and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown  
the myserious stranger begins his tale , or more precisely his confession , in geneva , 1773  
he is remembering his childhood and youth  
laughter , banquets and parties - a happy life , without troubles or concerns  
here victor lived with his father ( ian holm ) , mother ( cherie lunghi ) , his surrogate sister ( helena boham carter ) and his servants in happiness and harmony  
this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed  
like thunder from a quite sky , his mother dies , giving birth to his youngest brother  
shocked , baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair , victor ( already interested in science ) becomes obsessed with death  
standing on his mother's grave he says : "" oh mother   you 
did not have to die    no one should ever die    i 
will stop this   i 
promiss   "" 
after proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished , victor travels to ingolstadt , in presuite of a medical career  
after a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night , creating life from death  
composing dead bodies , frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man - both physically and mentally  
with strong electrical impulses , he managed to breeth life into his creation  
the result was ugliness  
realizing what he has done , frankenstein tried to undo his work , but it was to late  
the creature has escaped  
because of the epidemic , frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home , making plans for the wedding  
for a while everything is as it was before his mother's death  
but then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously    
whale's picture , although powerful , never managed to capture the total depth of the novel  
brannagh has more or less done that  
another thing is characters and actors  
branagh has developed every character and assembled a magnificent cast  
the greatest performances comes from de niro - the monster , that has been played by ( among others ) charles ogle , karloff , lon chaney , bela lugosi , glenn strange , christopher lee , fred gwynne ( as herman munster ) , and now , robert de niro  
alone , hated and feared , he is completely aware of his ugliness  
at first he is like a helpless , abandoned child , desperately reaching out for love  
later when he reads frankenstein's journal , and learns that he is composed of dead bodies , his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge  
he is capable of killing without regret  
 "" i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground     and 
then i slowly crushed his neck  "

1,"contact is a nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagan's only novel  
it details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of a young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway ( jodie foster )  
we first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico , where she is part of the seti ( search for extraterrestrial intelligence ) project  
her research is quickly killed , however , by her highly political david drumlin ( tom skerrit ) , who disdains "" pure research "" in favor of science with "" commercial applications  
she goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s  r  
hadden ( john hurt )  
then , with that money just about to finally dry up , ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal  
in the movie's most exciting and believable sequence , ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega  
at first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers , then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before  
further decoding , with hadden's help , reveals another layer to message , containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine  
it appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens' home world  
of course , the big question becomes "" who gets to ride it ? "" 
 ( right after "" who's gonna pay for this thing ? "" )  
to boil it down , ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism , while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith  
drumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform ( apparently to keep "" godless science "" from talking to god , or something like that )  
then hadden reappears with startling news  
he has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie , in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest  
ellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream-like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels , where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father ( david morse )  
when she returns home , no one believes her  
she was not even gone for one second , they say , even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours  
her story is officially discredited , although believed by a large segment of the public ( who don't even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static  
  
  
eighteen hours worth of static )  
there is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first  
ellie arroway is a well-rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working  
neither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs , but that's a tough standard to meet  
ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures  
her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally  
drumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble  
hadden obviously has affection for ellie , but in the end he seems to see her as his creation , nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board  
even palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , ellie's love interest , takes a paternalistic interest in ellie , seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses  
the film is technically impressive , especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine  
the part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain  
the film falls apart when dealing with its central theme , the dichotomy between science and religion  
this is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved  
the film presents science pretty well ( until the end ) so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith  
religious people are presented as shallow caricatures  
rob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank ( very subtle , guys ) , the voice of the religious right  
another religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine ( jake busey )  
the only really fleshed-out religious person , palmer joss , is supposed to be a minister of some sort , but his actual faith is left pretty vague  
i can't even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian  
all we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about pre-marital sex  
the film drops the science ball at the very end , when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith  
in a day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist "" religious "" doctrine , this is exactly the wrong message to send  
in a movie dealing with issues of science and faith , the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism  
what ellie should have said was , "" you shouldn't believe me  
not without evidence , and i don't have the evidence  
i know what happened but you shouldn't take my word alone  "" 
that is the voice of science speaking  
the character of david drumlin is another problem with this film  
his attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for a person in his position  
also , his profession of "" faith "" before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only a pack of idiots should have fallen for it  
the last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles  
the media figures , such as bernard shaw and jay leno aren't so bad , in as much as their participation was voluntary  
the use of bill clinton , however , should give anyone pause  
first of all , lifting the image of a sitting head of state and inserting him into a fictional story line , thus using his words outside of the context in which they were spoken , is just plain creepy  
also , using the real president places this film between 1993 and 2001 , forever dating it  
people watching this film in the future will say , "" hey , this never took place during clinton's term  "" 
this bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief  
also , the level of technology portrayed in the film is too advanced to take place before the first decade of the next century  
better to have had a fictitious president played by an actor or no president at all  
the film does raise an interesting question , although it never develops it in a satisfying way  
if we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture , would an atheist be automatically disqualified just because ninety percent of the population of the world professes a belief in god , or at least some form of supernatural creator ? 
personally , i would hope not , since religion is basically an opinion , a form of ideology  
i would not want any form of ideological test for such an import task "

1,"with the success of the surprise hit alien , directed by ridley scott , a sequel was inevitable  
in fact , after watching the first film , a sequel was wanted , particularly by this reviewer  
handing over the director's chair to recent box office gem james cameron , who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii , a surprisingly dull film , and terminator , making cameron a household name ) , the alien series got a face-lift of immense proportions  
instead of being a suspense/science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture  
what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created  
a film like aliens comes along only once in a while , and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it  
i never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have  
the terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear  
aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen  
with a science fiction plot , cameron gives aliens added testosterone , pumping up the action and fire power from the original film  
in fact , aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original  
perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero--or heroine , as the case may be  
never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film , and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character  
sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about  
placing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual , but because of weaver's presence , a woman is the only suitable hero  
aliens begins 57 years after alien ended  
lieutenant ellen ripley ( weaver ) is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened  
she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens , but "" the company "" is doubtful  
they explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left  
despite stern warnings from ripley , the company remains rigid and won't call the families back  
however , when the company loses contact with the colony , ripley's story seems much more feasible  
one of the company's directors , carter burke ( paul reiser ) , wants to gather a team to travel to the planet  
this team includes a buff private vasquez ( jenette goldstein ) , a questionable corporal hicks ( michael biehn ) , and a loyal android bishop ( lance henriksen )  
burke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony  
arriving on the planet , the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon-type environment  
the only survivor is 12 year old rebecca "" newt "" jorden ( carrie henn )  
ripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become , and she becomes newt's surrogate mother  
ripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened , and soon , all hell breaks loose  
aliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott's version , it also multiplies the number of aliens in general  
alien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member , except ripley , who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo  
aliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens , and as a result , the chills are incredibly heightened  
then again , this is james cameron , the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2 : judgment day  
he is the best action director out there ( topping renny harlin , who directed cliffhanger ) , and only he could create something as terrifying as this film  
it seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes , and aliens has the motherload  
with perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film , aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion  
i can't recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout , never dropping for a moment  
just when you think the movie is over , something else will occur , and it starts right back up again  
with a seemingly endless conclusion , aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history  
this scene is usually the one remembered most from the film , as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen  
using flawless special effects , the climax is exhausting , leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety  
of course , for a film of this genre to work properly , the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see  
aliens is completely realistic , even a decade after its initial release  
the special effects are wonderfully seamless , with a terrifying alien to go with them  
one of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music , composed by cameron-regular james horner  
horner has created a terrific score , receiving an oscar nomination for his work  
not only that , horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film , or science fiction film ever ( and that includes 2001 : a space odyssey , which was mainly a compilation of well-known composers )  
in fact , the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music  
the production design is incredible , which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy  
dark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive , but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well-lit locations  
normally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer ; aliens uses lights to scare the viewer  
then , of course , is the cinematography , which uses point of view shots , along with video feeds in order to build suspense  
some of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley  
surprisingly , the acting is not only above average for this genre , but some of the best  
sigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley , incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard-edged persona  
weaver soars above the rest in this film , but she is supposed to  
carrie henn gives an above average performance for a child , developing a three-dimensional character from her quiet attitude  
lance henriksen is terrific as bishop , showing that androids don't always have to be flat characters  
jenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role , and steals several scenes of her own ( though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn't fighting )  
michael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film  
however , biehn does a good job , making it seem original again  
paul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director , but reiser manages to pull it off quite well ( however , i still see him as paul on tv's "" mad about you "" )  
a very good cast ( which also includes bill paxton and william hope ) highlights this action film , making it stand out from others  
aliens is rightfully rated r for violence , gore , language , and terror  
aliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre , as alien was more of a suspense/horror film  
aliens pumps up the stakes , and cameron directs it with professional quality "

1,"in 1987 the stock market crashed , and oliver stone's wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses  
wall street lucked out in its timing ; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had , and though its kill-or-be-killed approach to business was exaggerated , that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan-era businessman  
stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs  evil tale relayed in the fast-paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange  
critics and audiences lauded wall street , elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic  
i'm proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them  
i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone's output with its thin caricatures , obvious sentiments , and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen  
stone goes for broke in every scene ( the same could be said for nearly all of his works )  
this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions  
he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane  
it's all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity , rather than explore what these situations are really like  
i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative ( as they are presented in boiler room ) rather than laughably over the top  
these guys are salesmen after all , not televised judges  
more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street  
the only possible solution i can muster is its release date  
and not just the timeliness of the "" greed is good "" subject matter : the film was plumped down in the eighties , a decade in which the one-joke comedy rose to an art form , and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept , low result movies  
in my mind , the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies , but bad music , bad hair , and bad clothes  
maybe stone's after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace  
boiler room is an equally well-timed film with some similarities to stone's piece of crap  
they both feature a consequential father-son relationship , though boiler room's is much more subtle and touching  
and they are both concerned with the power of greed , yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery-smooth , heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street  
boiler room is a message movie as well , though ( at least until the end ) doesn't shove it in our faces  
boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash  
as i said , this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day ( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn't been seen in quite a while ) ; not only do we want to be millionaires , we want to watch other people become millionaires ! 
in our super-judgmental , power-oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything ; when you have money , you have it "" all ""  
and seth ( giovanni ribisi ) wants it "" all "" the easy way  
he's a well-intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm ( the kind that sells junk stock ) whereupon he meets others just like him  
ben affleck is cast as jim , the company headhunter , who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko  
his job is to influence trainee's into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood  
it's ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b  s that they're told to dish out to prospective buyers  
affleck's character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin's similar character in glengary glen ross , and that proves detrimental to the actor's performance  
affleck shouts , curses and be-littles his rookie employees just like baldwin , minus the edge  
when alec played the scene he became the part , spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own  
by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading  
the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks : they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game  
rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are : intellectual gangsters  
they aren't above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes  
we drink up this world along with seth , and watch him become seduced by it , just like we might be  
as in all cautionary tales , boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing , then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness  
i know this story  
we all do  
but it can work if it's told with intelligence and energy , and that is how writer \ director ben younger tells it  
as a director of ( please excuse my french ) mise-en-scene younger has much to learn  
his style is sitcom bland  
but his writing isn't  
younger's script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch ; his dialogue is like a junior david mamet  
despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone-pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script  
the brokers \ hucksters counter every customer objection , gently bullying them into buying stock  
these moments are filmed like psychological action scenes : a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn't aware that he is one  
with the exception of affleck's brief appearances , the performances are truly exceptional  
ribisi , who has the edgy looks of a character actor , is extremely potent here , working his pale angular face , and eerie , plaintive stare for all their worth  
he conveys child-like vulnerability ( his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren't going his way ) in some scenes , and in others he's ferociously cut throat  
the jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie : ribisi is confident when it's just him and the phone , but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father ( authoritatively played by ron rifkin )  
boiler room thankfully avoids wall street-like histrionics in the sales-pitch sequences ; the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys  
those ploys are taught to seth by chris ( vin diesel ) , a kind broker who alternates between seth's friend and his mentor  
diesl shines in his minor role  
this week i saw the sci-fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner  
in that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80's , and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70's  
nicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can't have  
nia long , as the firm's secretary , ( a lone black women amongst many white men ) is ribisi's love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets , but develops into something more interesting  
the two make an oddly likeable couple  
long is smart and brash , and ribisi is charmingly aloof  
at one point he says to her "" i'm just lookin' for some chocolate love ""  
it's a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child-like way , it becomes sweetly endearing  
unfortunately , towards the end , the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy "

1,"a couple of months ago , when i first downloaded the face/off trailer from the net , my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold 'yawn'  
followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key , not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss-poor trailer  
then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u  s      unique    excellent     must-see  
well , i thought still skeptical , i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here  
'here' , of course , was still three months away  
i'll admit , when i trotted off to see this film , the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow  
i'd heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled , but his films were definitely not on my must-see list  
that , let me tell you , has changed completely  
i knew this fact only five minutes into the film , after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet  
the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick  
seriously  
i've never been a big john travolta fan , but he , like cage , perfectly suited his role in the movie      sorry , 
make that 'roles' in the movie  
even travolta's great performance , however , paled in comparison to cage's character portrayals  
my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler's hideout  
half drugged out of his mind , he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his son's death from castor's perspective - "" doesn't it just break your heart  "" he mutters coldly  
now don't go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie - it's not  
that's what really makes this movie unique  
it's an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters      not a common mix at all  
suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though      that's 
the only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other     and 
never hit  
several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press 'rewind' and watch it over again  
the part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a double-sided mirror is just plain brilliant  
whilst cage's and travolta's performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies , the lesser characters are just as intriguing  
joan allen , who usually sticks to the straight drama movies , plays her part perfectly as archer's long suffering wife  
i like the fact that her character didn't end up toting a gun at the end of the movie    it 
would have wrecked her potrayal  
gina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troy's mistreated girlfriend     "

because thats all that there really is     
i found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot  
for one thing , a white leading actor who has a black daughter does leave some curiosity     
i am not saying that this isn't possible   
but it does leave one to wonder    i 
know i did  
another thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out     
and certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations  
there was one scene that should have been short    
but it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking   
ok enough already get on with it  
there are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do    
things just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort    
another thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning  
this movie is also very predictable    
you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment   
granted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you  
also some of the things that happen are a little too predictable and several cliques are repeated    
it gets boring at times to tell you the truth    
even though there is still action going on  
another little point i might add is that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero  
some of the characters are not proper for their roles  
the acting is fine but the characters just don't seem to add up  
if i was to base my review totally on the plot then i wouldn't rate this movie too highly but that's just the thing this movie isn't just the plot , its the whole package and this package is really well done  
the whole movie is really well done and looks really good and if one was to overlook the flaws in the plot and characters then this is really a movie  
the special effects are just amazing , you can't tell that the dinosaurs are created it looks like they were there live , in a few instances of course you know its fake but there are other times that you just wouldn't be able to say that the creature wasn't there during filming , extinct or not  
another thing is the destruction scenes    
wow , those were masterpieces   
well some of them were they were well choreographed and along with the dino's make this one of the reasons to see this movie  
this movie is fairly long but it is action packed so it should do well in the box office   
unfortunately it will take away from fifth element but alas what can we do   
i may be too cynical for my age but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects and for it few funny moments  "

soldier a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman 
the warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body  
jungian archetypes , these two opposites need each other to create a whole , but it's difficult to integrate both  
often we'll encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and , with the help of jung's magician , sit around imagining grand schemes  
without the drive to manifest their plans , much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness , all they have are dreams  
warriors on the other hand , are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat , and will do combat with every last bit of their energy  
they don't care enough about anything to know what's worth fighting for : gladiators who live only for the battle  
this dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know , but can also illustrate societies  
america during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers  
todd 3465 ( kurt russell ) is a living , breathing archetype  
chosen from birth as a soldier , he is raised by the government to be a killing machine  
his childhood is cruelty and competition  
he is indoctrinated with the big rules  
never question authority  
winning is everything  
strength beats knowledge  
a veteran of numerous intergalactic wars , todd is 40 and he's obsolete  
a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger  
left for dead after a test battle with the best of the new killers , caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) , he's unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234 , a garbage world  
obviously our hero is still alive  
he finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health  
when the peace-loving colonists get a good look at who todd is , they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world  
they are the other good guys  
these lovers find that they need a warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons  
todd finds himself in the role of protector  
what could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultra-right wing future is ruined by turning the film into a cartoon  
the effects are mostly second-rate explosions or jerky slow motion  
the plot is old hat  
we don't get even a glimpse at the society that created the soldiers  
hardly anything makes sense  
the film's science fares badly  
with all the remarkable advances we've made in just 37 years ( the film takes place in 2036 ) , we're still stupid  
after conquering the stars , for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it to a landfill light years away  
even stranger , the garbage barges appear to double as time machines  
virtually all the trash is vintage 1960  
there is nothing in the story that is not predictable  
the first thing that todd sees after coming back to life is sandra ( connie nielsen ) , the woman just a little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care of him  
it doesn't take a genius to foresee that her husband isn't going to be around much longer  
is it a shock to find out that the film's climax is an unarmed battle between todd and caine ? 
who would you guess wins ? 
some of the scenes would work if this were a comedy  
todd's first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connie's nipple poking through her thin blouse  
later as he sits by his lonely campfire , a tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion  
supposedly this clich ? isn't meant to be humorous  
dastardly col  mekum ( jason isaacs ) with a pencil-thin mustache is as real as snidley whiplash  
responsible for last year's quirky and visually enticing but problematic "" the fifth element "" , director paul anderson sees the film as "" shane "" in outer space  
maybe , if shane were played by sylvester stallone in rambo mode  
the movie doesn't even work as an action film  
there is never a question as to the outcome  
somehow the new superior soldiers don't prove much of a match for todd  
the acting isn't anything to write home about  
nielsen almost comes across as a real person but is soon relegated to a background victim  
russell is buffed-up and does a credible job but it's not much of a challenge  
uttering around 100 words during the film , mostly what todd does is hit things and stare grimly into space  
gary busey as todd's commanding officer is completely wasted in his low-key role  
everything blows up and occasionally it looks cool  
sometimes the sets are impressive  
unfortunately "" occasionally "" and "" sometimes "" don't make a film  
most disappointing is that the screenplay is by david webb peoples who wrote "" blade runner "" , possibly the best science fiction movie ever made  
sharp-eyed viewers will notice a few obscure references to that film  
peoples says that this is not a "" blade runner "" sequel , but a "" sidequel "" that takes place in the same universe  
although that may have been the intent in his original script , the result is more like a bad television series that the "" blade runner "" replicants watch to pass time  
perhaps those artificial humans would find this entertaining  
 ( michael redman has written this column for over 23 years and wants to wish everyone an appropriate halloween    whatever 
you'd like it to be "

after a hiatus of about fifteen years , the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest  
in early 1997 , there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone , one on television and two in the theaters , with dante's peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar  
of the two , i had heard that dante's peak was the better film , so i decided to check it out when it was released on video  
the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town  
the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption  
flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky , crushing homes and people  
we see people panicking , people crying , and even horses rearing  
it is a disaster of biblical proportions , signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road  
symbolism doesn't get much more blatant than that  
we learn that harry dalton ( pierce brosnan ) , a volcanologist with the u  s  geological survey , was there with his wife when the eruption occurred  
harry survived , but his wife did not  
a few years later , harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante's peak , washington ( which , we are told , has been voted second most desirable place to live ( under 20 , 000 ) by the readers of money magazine )  
there harry meets rachel wando , a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante's peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop  
although the mayor doesn't seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up , a few members of the city council are  
they are afraid that harry's presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante's peak  
they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug  
however , when an amorous young couple takes a skinny-dip in the local hot springs , they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath  
thus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption  
this film contains a number of cliches  
the amorous couple is one  
as soon as they doff their clothes , you know they're going to die  
the town busybody and the abrasive mother-in-law make appearances , as does the death-defying dog  
countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable  
watching the movie , i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements , but some of the dialogue as well  
unfortunate , since much of the dialog is terrible  
for example , harry's boss , paul ( charles hallahan ) , and a team from the u  s  geological survey join harry to assess the situation  
paul basically tells the townsfolk that harry's eruption predictions aren't cause for alarm  
this causes harry to leave in a fit of rage , only to turn up the next day , ready for work  
when paul asks harry why he stayed , he says with grim determination , "" cause this town's in trouble and i'm the best man you've got  "" 
even better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving  
he likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water  
if the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up , however , the frog won't move and will allow itself to be cooked  
 "" is that your recipe for frog soup ? "" 
asks one of the team members  
 "" it's my recipe for disaster , "" responds harry  
dante's peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious  
our heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid  
mayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming , in a very grave tone , "" acid eats metal  "" 
thanks for the tip  
when we first see the u  s  geological survey building , there's a caption labeling it as such  
this wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads , in large letters , "" u  s  geological survey  "" 
i suppose the caption is for people who can't read signs  
although harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film , the viewer has no idea why  
there is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters , and the relationship seems rushed because of this  
when they get close to kissing , i was asking myself , "" why do they want to kiss ? 
were they even attracted to each other ? "" 
if i were the mayor , i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesn't even crack a smile through the whole movie , trying to pull off the rough-yet-debonair act  
who does he think he is ? 
james bond ? 
the eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed  
there are several "" warning signs "" prior to the eruption itself , but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we don't feel as if they are leading up to anything  
for example , one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve a remote controlled robot  
a tremor occurs  
does he plunge headlong to his death ? 
is he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below ? 
no , a couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg  
the sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene , which i suppose was intended to be dramatic as well  
it wasn't  
one plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dante's peak  
in a disaster movie , there's usually one guy who's greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruption/fire/earthquake/explosion/tsunami/tornado/meteorite , and usually gets killed by the disaster  
it's okay , of course , because we all think he got what he deserved  
if you're going to be unoriginal , you might as well go all the way  
in dante's peak , the city councilmembers are concerned , but they don't really try hard enough "

if there was a possibility to receive a refund , this review would not be forthcoming  
but as it is , "" godzilla "" is without a doubt the loudest , longest , and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio  
producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves , and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch "" last year at merienbad "" until they can grasp the idea of content and plot  
no amount of hype , no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine ( billy the kid vs  
dracula )  
 "" godzilla "" opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs  
we are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship ( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins )  
well , the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature  
later , a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache ( jean reno ) interview the sole survivor  
in a state of shock , the only thing the man can utter is the word "" gojira "" ( the japanese name of the famed beast )  
we are then introduced to dr  nick tatopoulos ( matthew broderick , with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film )  
he is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population  
he is immediately drafted by the u  s  military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature  
in a short amount of time , another fishing boat ( loaded with canned tuna from the u  s  and korea for some reason ) is found grounded in jamaica  
well , it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york  
when the beast finally appears , he tears up one building , stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert ( thumbs up for new york )  
the military , with dr  tatopoulos's help , have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system  
it finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr  tatopoulos who snaps the beast's picture  
the monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting , and the chase is on , with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage  
working from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple , dr  totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated )  
well the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant  
needless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster's nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city ( even though the monster isn't dead yet )  
i sincerely hope that i've completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film  
i gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour's wage on this tripe  
everything about "" godzilla "" reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast  
the script ( and let's be clear here ) by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years "" razzie "" award  
the dialogue between maria pitillo ( as audrey timmonds , dr  tatopoulos' estranged girlfriend ) and mr  broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed )  
the film could be enjoyably campy if it didn't take itself so damn seriously  
but to what end , as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature , nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind  
no  godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it  
the film is bleak and ugly looking  
taking place at night during a rain storm , the movie has little or no depth  
everything is ugly and dark  
new york has never looked so inhospitable since "" death wish ""  
in an attempt to give the film some color , audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue  
the only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica , where dr  tatopoulos finds himself standing in a giant footprint  
the scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up  
you know from the outset that nick is standing in a footprint  
for a scientist , this is very poor observation  
let's look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film ( this activity , is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game ) : 
1  ) why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs , and how do those eggs fuse into one beast ? 
2  ) why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate ( such as new york ) to nest ? 
i don't think iguana's have a habit of migrating  
3  ) how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system , slice a submarine in half , yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin ( in comparison ) steel cable on the brooklyn bridge ? 
4  ) the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need it's suspension cables  
5  ) did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly ? 
if so , then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures  
 ( note : each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide  
godzilla would have to be over 1 , 000 feet tall to carry them all )  
6  ) godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters , but new york cabs are made of stronger steel

dr  d's rating : critical condition ( 
okay , here's the deal  
i'll be the first one to grant that everybody needs a day off now and then  
i'll even go so far as to say that a vacation is a necessary part of doing any job well  
i mean , hey , i've been known to stretch a weekend into a three-day outing , if friday looks to be a slow day

a simple sentence like that , and i've got a nice four-day fishing trip with the boys , or more often than not , a trip up to cherokee , n  c  , for jackpot bingo and assorted other mountain funnery  
but the point is , if you take a day off , do something different  
if you've worked yourself silly for months , relax a bit  
sleep in  
eat pancakes at noon  
microwave an egg in its shell  
watch pro wrestling with the sound off  
listen to some barry white records at high speed  
whatever

but the contest doesn't end there , guys and gals  
we get steals from russ meyer movies , where everybody in town is horny and sweaty  
we get the town from bad day at black rock , minus the train , plus busty women who can speak  
look at any schwarzenegger film , and you'll see our hero , bobby , as bobby has a mudhole stomped in his keister a dozen times , has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times , gets bit by a tarantula , gets shot at , and ends up with vultures circling overhead , all the while getting up like he just got a shaving nick  
bobby as terminator ? 
stretch it a bit , and we have a five-finger discount from doc hollywood , where the whole story occurs because of car trouble , forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic  
okay , he's working from a book , so maybe ollie's not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas  
i just expect a man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative  
i just wish he hadn't brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toe-stub  
sean penn gives a great performance , and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be , playing over-the-top caricatures of stereotype characters  
the best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blankety-blank is going on  
too bad it's not fun to watch when it's happening to us    while 
we sit through this mess of a film  
u-turn is not a bad film if you're a fan of technique  
it's the oliver stone you've always known  
robert richardson is his usual cinematographer , and rob and ollie know how to shoot a flick -- great camera angles , shifting viewpoints , wicked colors , nice looking pictures  
but pictures of what ? 
i think i'd rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tilt-o-whirl point of this loser film  
plot twists are one thing , repetition is almost unforgivable , and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie i've seen in the past five years  
oliver , i know your body of work is nothing to sniff at  
you've been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie , and films like platoon , jfk , wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on  
your scripts are certainly respectable , your budgets are up there on the screen , and your actors don't dog it  
and i know that , maybe , with u-turn , you were just kicking back , just having fun "

ewan mcgregor - codename : "" eye "" - is pointing a high-tech rifle-ly gadget at a fat , bald business-oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across the street  
we get the requisite electro-green through-the-sight view  
we the audience , seeing a high tech rifle-ly gadget , of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target , but instead , he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy , low-quality photographs , which eye then proceeds to fax and e-mail to everyone in his target's office  
all right , so thirty seconds in , i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle/camera , but i was still open minded    
maybe there's a really good reason for it  
i've got reason to believe , you see - i admire a lot of ewan mcgregor's previous work    
and he's obi wan ke- friggin-nobi for god's sake  
and director stephan elliot's last movie priscilla , queen of the desert was a quirky little delight  
there's some genuine talent involved here  
i think at the twenty minute mark , there was still a spark of hope in my heart  
eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization's son ( i still have no idea what this organization was - british intelligence ? 
national spy ring ? 
private investigation ? ) , who is apparently stealing from his trust fund  
he has received his assignment from k  d  
lang , through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase  
when eye tracks his target to an expensive- looking secluded house , he witnesses a mysterious and beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) take a knife out and proceed to stab the poor bastard  
ok , that's odd , i think to myself , this could be interesting  
then she starts to cry , and through her tears exclaims "" merry christmas , dad ! "" 
for the first time  
so begins our tale of obsession    
or    something  
the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor's eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states , totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar  
throughout his entire professional life , he has been a voyeur ; so when he falls for someone , the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras  
fine , that's a lovely premise , i suppose  
but gosh darn it , if you're going to go there , you better have some sort of explanation  
and that's precisely where this film fails  
this is the kind of movie that pisses me off  
it's an abortion , a collection of half-formed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end  
it pretends it is something that it is not - a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a high-tech thriller  
here , the filmmakers have confused "" surreal "" and "" deep "" with "" vaguely unclear "" and "" crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors  "" 
i never , even for an instant , had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in "" love "" with this woman who changes wigs and kills people  
the movie offers only two explanations , neither of which make a lick of sense  
explanation number one : the obnoxious presence of eye's imaginary daughter , who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago , tells him he shouldn't leave ms  judd  
explanation two , which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie : "" beauty is in the eye of the beholder  "" 
whoo hoo , that helps , thanks a bunch , case closed  
that's as deep as it gets , folks  
there is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes , which , instead of tying everything together , ends up being as profound as a clever sixth-grade mad lib  
there are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was  
my personal favorites include : the prison-matron modeled after austin powers' frau farbissina , who apparently taught ms  judd everything she knows about wearing wigs ; jason priestley's awfully played dirty desert vagrant #1 , who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet , but fails miserably ; and the cop-who-sees-ashley-fleeing-an-accident-scene-and- then-wants-to-pay-for-sex- but-is-shot  
each one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last  
the script pays no attention to the laws of time and space  
any time one of the frequent location changes occurs , the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe , and minutes , weeks , or years could have passed  
bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair - one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slow-motion close-up awash in a lot of bass  
ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell  
jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks , then laughs maniacally    
cut to random guy with eye patch    
iguana out of focus    
iguana comes into focus  
wow , man "

-1,"the above is dialogue from this film , taken almost completely in context , and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is  
it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film , and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about , especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously  
mr  gregg "" i'm-having-a-mid-life-crisis "" araki , the writer and director of this film , wants to show how important teenagers are , and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible , horrible world  
and how does he show it ? 
by really cheap surrealism , and moronic exchanges like this  
oh , and it gets better  
a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of , oh i dunno , the fiftieth sex scene in this film ( i'm not counting the several masturbation scenes )  
in it , one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another , and he says to her something along the lines of "" do you ever wonder what life is all about ? "" 
sorry , man : foreplay takes place before the act of coitus  
of course , what do you expect : the film was written and directed by a guy who can't even spell his first name right ( yes , i know it's a cheap joke , but it had to be done )  
 "" the doom generation "" is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them , and also as another "" teen angst "" film ( one of the slogans is "" teen is a four-letter word "" - hardy har har )  
it's a film about two angsty teens - amy blue ( rose macgowan , who would later play the buxom tatum in "" scream "" ) and jordon white ( james duval , who would go on to play randy quaid's son in "" independence day "" ) - who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac , xavier red ( jonathan schaech , who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in "" that thing you do ! "" 
- and by the way , do you get the symbolism ? 
red , white , and blue ? 
huh ? 
huh ? ) , and go on a road trip where three things happen , in no order : 1 ) they have sex ; 2 ) they run into weird people ; 3 ) they kill them  
the film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films  
gregg araki obviously has seen such films as "" easy rider , "" "" natural born killers , "" and "" kalifornia , "" and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide  
but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not , or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper  
 "" the doom generation "" doesn't want to do this ; it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level  
he wants to show everything in a weird manner , and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about  
here's one scene , an earlier scene in the film : amy and jordan go into a quick-e mart type place to get food and other stuff  
amy is smoking , and the clerk , an asian man mind you ( i love how racist this film is , i really do ) , tells her to put it out  
she tells him to fuck off or something to that note  
he points a shotgun at her , and she puts it out reluctantly  
jordan makes two hot dogs , and takes them to the counter  
the cash register rings up "" 6  66 "" 
 ( oh , and this symbolism doesn't stop here )  
jordan checks for his wallet but it's really in the car  
he asks amy for it , but she left her wallet in the car as well  
the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money  
they say they don't have it  
he gets ready to kill them , but then xavier , who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before , pops out of nowhere , fights with the clerk , and ends with him blowing the clerk's head clean off ( clean wound , mind you )  
the head is shown flying through the air , and lands in a fryer , where it begins to scream  
i don't really object to this kind of sick violence , but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only : to gross you out  
araki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme , he'll make some kind of art  
wrong  
it takes a kind of resistance to make gore art  
when george romero made "" dawn of the dead , "" a very gory flick even for today , he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick  
same goes for peter jackson's disgustingly gory "" dead alive , "" which features a 30 minute long fest of blood , guts , dismemberments , flesh chewing , and other assorted stuff , all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body , taking out all sorts of zombies  
it was sick , but it was also satirical , and controled  
a scene like this has no purpose in the film , and it sticks out from everything else that happens  
here's a couple other scenes : jordan and amy have sex in a bath tub and xavier watches , masturbates , and then licks the semen from his hand ; xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window , masturbates , and falls backwards ; a man attacks the trio , and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword ( put there just so this could happen ) ; a fast food employee stalks the trio , and his arm is shot off by xavier ; and various other annoyances  
also , look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people , who probably didn't really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it ( just like peter o'toole , helen mirren , malcolm macdowell , and john gielgud probably didn't when they signed to be in "" caligula "" )  
people such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt , alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel , hollywood madam heidi fleiss , christopher "" peter brady "" mcknight , amanda bearse , and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds , then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line  
why are they here ? 
so that we can all point to them and say "" hey , look it's ( fill in the blank ) ! 
wow ! "" 
gimme a break  
the film's meaning is pretty easy to detect : that , you know , teens are so precious , and the world is such a horrible place , that when the two entities collide , there's a giant explosion of horrific violence  
otherwise defined as "" teen angst , "" or the belief that being a teenager is a horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you  
look , i'm 19 years old  
i went through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did  
i've since moved on to "" i don't really know what to do with my life "" phase , but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks they're dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse  
part of being a teen is experimenting , and testing the waters  
it's not whining about how awful parents are , and purposely feeling dispondent  
this is what the characters in this film do , and the film wants to show how they're these great people who are being punished by the world because they're teenagers , and how they try to defend themselves but can't totally overcome them  
it's not their fault they kill people ; it's the world's ! 
what they really need is a reality check  
the world is a bad place , and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting  
but part of it is taking everything that happens to you and learning from it  
the film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed , and there's nothing they can do about it  
hence the title  
not only does it have bad fallacy , but it can't even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner  
everything's overly surreal , and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex  
how does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst ? 
how does a talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way ? 
and why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film ? 
if araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction , he'd show them for what they really are  
and if he didn't want the satirical approach , he'd show the real problems with the world  
and if you still don't think that "" the doom generation "" is incompetent on every single possible level it could be , take the acting  
rose macgowan is horrible  
yes , she proved herself talented in "" scream , "" but she's so bad in "" the doom generation "" that if i had not seen her in "" scream , "" i would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today  
her entire performance is one-note ( bitchy ) , and the one scene where she cries over a dead animal is so forced that it's laughable  
equally bad is jonathan schaech , who wants to be the slacker serial killer : someone who doesn't have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain  
his performance is annoying as hell , and granted , he was better in "" that thing you do ! "" 
and then there's james duval  
let's just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando "

 "" runners "" take bets from potential lottery winners and deliver them to private locations for drawings  
the undisputed leader of the harlem numbers is the madame queen ( cicely tyson ) who is challenged by dutch schulz ( tim roth ) , a ruthless hoodlum  
by turning against the queen , dutch defies his partner , the infamous lucky luciano ( andy garcia ) , who wishes to respect the queen and keep the peace  
the queens' army strengthens when an acquaintance , ellsworth "" bumpy "" johnson ( lawrence fishburne ) is released from prison and becomes a bodyguard for her  
he proves himself worthy in short time as he thwarts an assassination attempt ( on himself and the queen ) , and later takes control of the queens army when she is jailed for tax evasion  
bumpy's reign is not as restrained and subdued as the queen and he declares all out war on dutch  
bloody gang warfare ensues  
bumpy faces many obstacles during his reign  
his new army questions his methods  
his girlfriend ( vanessa l  williams ) and the queen disagree with his violent solutions  
most importantly ( in his eyes ) , dutch has become a more formidable foe than he imagined , and seeks help from lucky luciano to assassinate him  
there have been so many movies dealing with organized crime that it must be hard to write an original story dealing with it  
this movie is not original at all  
in fact , i was angered by how many similarities there was between this film and , arguably , the best gangster movie of all time , the godfather  
if you are going to borrow ideas from another movie and not give credit , why not borrow from a lesser known movie ( say , millers crossing ? )  
how could the credited screenwriter chris brancato not give credit to mario puzo himself ? 
here are just some of the major similarities ( i stopped counting at 10 )  
crooked cop assaults blood relative of the leader  
gang extracts revenge on crooked cop  
wife ( or girlfriend ) questions her partners' murderous activities and leaves him  
high ranking "" officer "" betrays the leader  
blood relative of the leader murdered  
war erupting between the "" families ""  
high-ranking officer disapproves of the leader in front of other family members  
new leader runs family differently from previous leader  
large meeting with all families involved  
the setup in this movie is done rather well  
i enjoyed the portrayal of the network of "" runners "" sprinting through the streets collecting bets for the queens lottery  
this was the way of life in harlem , and most people involved with the queen did so because it was the only way to support their families and put food on the table  
number running was the only way for the harlem population to find work  
i also enjoyed the interaction between the angry , violent dutch and the calm , patient lucky  
after about the 30-40 minute mark all of the similarities with the godfather start appearing , one after the other ( and in short order )  
it was a huge distraction , and an insult to my intelligence  
who was the screenwriter kidding here ? 
some of the individual performances were well done  
andy garcia was very convincing as lucky , unfortunately his screen time is reduced to a supporting role  
tim roth effectively plays the cocky villain , much like his roles in "" the cook , the thief , his wife and her lover "" and "" rob roy ""  
the good performances and convincing setup during the first third of the movie do not make up for the lackluster story that follows  
a couple of coincidences is one thing , over a dozen is an insult  
directed by bill duke 
ellsworth bumpy johnson        lawrence 
fishburne dutch schultz             tim

the garbage known as "" snuff "" films ? 
nothing , right ? 
what's to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography ? 
well    nothing  
so , why make it , hollywood ? 
there's no reason why the average , sane movie-goer will be interested in such a topic  
no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this  
the lack of quality filmmaking in "" 8mm "" ( from technical to acting ) stands out even more when you consider the star , writer , and supporting cast--all reputable  
but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again ! 
like paul schrader , schumacher has his moments , but they're few and far ( far ! ) 
between  
basically , this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it  
why not walk out ? 
well , this wouldn't be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie  
here's why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of "" 8mm ""    
first thing--if you don't heed my advice , then understand what you're about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud  
it's not easy to watch  
i didn't know the details of the story beforehand , but at least my ignorance can help others now  
the ( ha ! ) plot revolves around tom welles ( nicolas cage ) as a surveillance expert and private investigator  
a rich old woman discovers a "" snuff "" film in her late husband's safe  
she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl ( it had to be a young girl , didn't it , schumacher ! ) who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead  
she's horrified that her husband would have owned such a film ( in 8mm , of course ) and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find  
family-man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque "" murder ""  
let me backtrack for a moment  
see , "" snuff "" films are pornos with a violent twist--people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead  
however , the deaths are often staged and , in those cases , special effects and "" good "" acting make all the difference  
very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard-to-find movies  
the thought of this "" industry "" makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review , but i'll swallow my bile and move on  
welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry  
you'd think he's sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him ! 
he comes across smut clerk max ( joaquin phoenix ) who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze  
after a lot of digging and bribing , welles finds the men who are responsible for making this , and other , "" snuff "" films  
skip ahead , skip ahead , skip ahead    
led by dino velvet ( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance ) and star-torturer "" machine "" ( christopher bauer ) , they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue  
the movie doesn't end there , unfortunately , because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films do--become a vigilante  
this film doesn't draw you in  
it keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close ? 
it is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ( ie  
 "" se7en "" ) , but it takes a large measure of restraint ( schumacher has none ) and a larger amount of talent ( schumacher has little )  
by those jabs , i'm not only referring to his stylish destruction of the "" batman "" franchise , but "" a time to kill "" was an immensely overrated disappointment  
for a guy who gets so much studio money , his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled  
a good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter  
writer andrew kevin walker didn't recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for '95s twisted thriller , "" se7en ""  
director schumacher doesn't have that innate ability to make you watch things you don't really want to see like better directors are capable of doing  
he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don't see is more frightening than what we do ( especially when it's a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered )  
however , gratuitous is joel's middle name  
he must think that not flaunting a hard-core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint  
no , he doesn't go that far , but we see enough unpleasantness  
he doesn't leave much to the imagination  
it's manipulating to hurt ( or kill ) young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante  
the script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters , yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ( ha ha ! ) 
craft  
case in point , a shot of a christian fellowship bus ( good , right ? ) 
drives away to reveal one of the villains ( bad , right ? )  
see    no 
subtlety  
does joel think we're stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery ? 
who do we root for in this mess ? 
is there anybody out there ? 
it's not all the director's fault , though  
why did the actors sign up for this ? 
nicolas cage is an oscar-winner , for cryin' out loud ! 
if he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money , what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda ? 
what is cage supposed to be in this movie--a whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears ? 
villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy  
and what is james gandolfini doing in this trash ? 
he was so solid as a concerned father in "" a civil action ""  
i guess ol' nic , pete , and jim were promised a mountain of money    or 
they're suckers  
or they just don't care  
there are moments ( albeit brief ones ) where this rises above the wasteland  
catherine keener is good ( although too quick to threaten divorce ) as mrs "

then one day , she sees him knock a woman upside the head with a baseball bat  
ooooooooh ! 
she must then join together with her model-friends to find out whether or not this guy is really goofy-but-loveable , or a psycho killer

this thing stinks to high-heaven  
it's just plain embarrassing for everyone involved  
i even felt my iq dip below its usual low as toilet humor somehow worked its way into this so-called romantic-comedy-action movie ?

hey , i'm actually starting to sound a little like harry knowles here , but i guess i could see where his frustration comes from time to time  
it's sad really

pure hilarity ! 
or maybe i'm just too jaded , too much of a critic , not relaxed enough to enjoy this fluff-piece    uuuhhmmm    naaaaah ! ! 
this movie sucks the big one  
it's chockfull of stupid characters delivering inane dialogue fitting snuggly into a preposterous plot  
this is the kind of movie that has one character inserting another character into a car headfirst to the floor only because    well , 
it's supposed to be funny , see ? 
you see , that person then has their legs swinging in the other person's face as they drive and that distracts the driver , see , and well , that's kinda funny , no ? 
harumph    yeah , 
well    you 
get the picture ! 
anyhoo , freddie prinze jr     nuff 
said  
monica potter , a bad career move , but we might forgive you if you keep up the julia roberts bit  
the rest of the model girls    well , 
thanks for being there so i had something to look at , but please apologize to the entire modeling community as a whole , for making them all out to be complete imbeciles ! ! 
so why the three points out of ten , you may ask ? 
well , it's simple really  
one point goes to the russian model girl and that cool accent ( don't ask me why , but it actually turned me on )  
one point goes out to all of the model girls for being in the movie ( nice window decoration    natch ! )  
and one last point goes out to the makers of this film , who spared us any long sorted story , and made sure to give us the opportunity of leaving the theatre after only 90 minutes of manufactured garbage , so that we could run out as fast as we can , grab the next person that we see walking down the street and warn them of the devil that is    freddie prinze jr    i 
mean , head over heels  
you've been warned , good people  
ps : didja notice how i didn't even mention rear window once in my entire review ? 
i didn't want to taint the memory of the classic flick by having it uttered alongside this thing , but then again , i just did mention it , but i guess it doesn't count in the ps section "

-1,"when i watch a movie like mike nichols' what planet are you from ? 
i can't help but feel like everyone is looking at me  
it's as if all the audience is gazing at the back of my head in the darkness , eyes shooting daggers , quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hard-earned money to spend their time watching this    
this    
thing  
i shift uncomfortably in my seat  
i'm reminded of how i feel when i see a pair of second- or third-rate celebrities engaging in a teleprompted "" funny "" conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award  
it's not my fault , i know it's not my fault , but dammit , someone's gotta be embarrassed , because it doesn't look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame  
i'm about to give you a list of names of people who are gonna make a movie together : garry shandling , annette bening , john goodman , greg kinnear , mike nichols  
do any of these names make you instantly shudder ? 
the answer i would have come up with before today is no , this is quite a list of talented individuals we've got here  
granted , john goodman was in the flintstones , and greg kinnear has turned in some less-than-lackluster leading man performances in certified failures like a smile like yours , but even so , they've got proven power as excellent supporting players  
garry shandling has two television classics under his belt , his ingenious little it's garry shandling's show and the larry sanders show  
and for god's sake , mike nichols directed the graduate , and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty  
so explain this    
this    
thing  
what planet are you from ? 
purports to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole pop-psychology mars/venus phenomenon  
but what this movie winds up being is a collection of unfunny cringe-inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe-inducing moments ; the end result is , unsurprisingly , an unfunny , uninsightful , cringe-inducing , thoroughly icky embarrassment  
garry shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males ( they reproduce through cloning , of course )  
his leaders put a select group of males through a series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth , find a female of the species , and impregnate her  
they're taught how to pretend that they're listening by nodding and saying "" uh-huh , "" and how to compliment shoes  
imagine my delighted surprise when , oh heavens , all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably , producing comedic results ! 
the lucky winner is fitted with a penis ( since theirs , after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence    
i will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that they're all just clones    
whoops , too late  ) 
the penis , when aroused , tends to make a humming noise  
the writers , when frequently strapped for ideas , tend to turn to this as a source of "" comedy  "" 
it isn't funny the first time  
it isn't funny the eighth time  
it isn't funny the eighteenth time  
if anything , it made me feel vaguely self-conscious  
garry meets up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear , who turns out to be a generic , unlikable scumbag  
he's meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandling's alien character , but he's so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside  
kinnear's scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims other peoples' work as his own to worm his way into a vice presidents' position and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks  
wow  
what a magnificent bastard  
nearly every man in the movie , in fact , is played as the same sort of sex-driven slimeball  
when kinnear's wife walks into the office , there isn't a single guy who doesn't trip , bump into a wall , or otherwise pratfall as if they'd never seen a woman before  
the few guys that aren't particularly slimeballs , such as john goodman's detective character , are simply uncommunicative workaholics  
shandling meets up with annette bening , who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed , at one of kinnear's aa meetings  
shandling's mission is to have a baby , and when he reveals his desires to her , bening instantly falls for him , and the next day    
they get married  
yup  
the next day  
cuz ya see , it turns out she wants a baby too ! 
bening's character perhaps was the most difficult to watch , especially after seeing her come apart at the seams so effectively in american beauty    
if her character here is supposed to be representing the female of the species as a whole , then woe , i say , to the species  
she's unfathomably insecure , and succumbs so easily to all of shandling's lines and lies that it borders on tragic  
there's a point where , after thinking she may not be able to bear children , she learns that she is indeed pregnant  
when garry comes home after nearly cheating on her , she strolls into the kitchen and sings "" high hopes "" ( you know , the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song ) to deliver the news , and then says to him , "" now you can't leave me  "" 
we're supposed to empathize with shandling's discovery of the feeling of "" guilt , "" but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing  
and eventually , shandling falls in love with her "

it tries to be twice as big as it's predecessor , yet ends up twice as shallow  
shallow     hmm    now there's an idea  
maybe if the ill-fated cruise liner in this movie had struck a shallow reef early on things may have turned out better  
the first thing that struck me    and 
surprised me , was that the camera work ( for the opening sequence anyway ) was terrible  
looked like the cameramen were drunk and kept tripping on their own feet       very 
different to the original movie  
the characters ? 
well , not many of the characters actually * had * characters , but here's a rundown  
annie , who was the highlight of the the original , must have seriously banged her head in the train crash at the end of the first movie  
why ? 
because something's got to account for her losing that many iq points  
even though annie wasn't exactly a rocket scientist in speed , here some of her actions just make you want to beat your head against a wall  
for instance , after successfully using a chainsaw to cut a hole in a door so that a group of people can escape noxious gases - she stands in the middle of the opening for about five minutes till someone reminds her that the people can't get ut till she get's the chainsaw out of their faces     bang 
bang bang 
in point of fact sandra's character is turned into little more than one of those scantly dressed extras from hercules , who constantly has to be rescued  
jason patric ? 
all i can say is bring back keanu  
keanu reeves might have the emotional range of a tree stump    but 
that's one more tree stump than jason has  
i don't think he changed facial expressions all movie - jason , smile for the cameras ! ! 
now frown !    i said frown     oh    you are    bang 
bang bang   
wooden just doesn't describe this guys performance , but it'll have to do  
the bad guy      ahh    william 
dafoe - there's a bright move  
how can you go wrong with the star from that acknowledged classic , body of evidence ? 
 ( yes , that is sarcasm )  
his wide eyed maniac of a character doesn't start out too bad   "

-1,"your first clue that something isn't gonna be quite right with the movie you're about to see : it's heavily christmas-themed and its release date is , oh , say , at the end of february  
your second clue that something isn't gonna be quite right with the movie you're about to see : charlize theron , one of the movie's dubious stars , makes an appearance on the daily show in which , when asked if her new movie's any good , she replies with the equivalent of a verbal sigh    
assuring us that , yeah , it sure is a movie , all right ! 
and there's some scenes like those you'd expect to find in a movie , and there's some action    
and there's other    
stuff    
too  
how to immediately grab my attention : open your movie with five dead guys in santa claus suits  
then show a caption reading "" six days earlier    "" 
ya know , i was honestly interested to find out what killed all those poor santas    
how to immediately lose my attention : follow your opening scene with a terminally dull nice-guys-who-don't-deserve-to-be-in-prison scene  
write a line for the one of prisoners like "" i just want to go home and eat christmas dinner and watch some ball with my dad  "" 
then , have ben affleck actually say that line , on film , and forget to leave it on the cutting room floor  
for good measure , throw in a poorly motivated prison riot and have affleck's best buddy stabbed    
aw    
and just two days before his release , too  
already the cliches are piled on thick , and when it rains , it pours  
how to take my attention , dash it violently against the rocks , and make it so that i'm contemplating my strategy for calling "" shotgun "" about an hour before i know the credits will roll : deny your characters the ability to think  
have ben affleck , for some reason i'll never understand , pretend he's his dead prison buddy so that he can get his girlfriend , played by charlize theron  
have gary sinise show up and force the two of them to participate in a poorly planned casino heist  
the villains' big idea ? 
kidnap affleck because he used to be a security guard at the casino , force him to tell you where all the doors in the place are , then dress up in santa suits , create some "" diversions "" and rob the place  
on paper , it seems like the stuff of a potential caper comedy , but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks he's looking at the makings for some sort of clever action-crime thriller  
it's not like the man isn't capable    
far from it  
he's the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may  
he wowed me with some the most memorable car chases i've ever seen in last year's ronin  
but he's certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers    
put reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his 1996 version of the island of dr  moreau  
step one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible : cast ben affleck in the role of the world's most generic hero  
he gets no good one-liners , he doesn't get to shoot or implode anything in new and interesting ways , and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as a car thief and wants a cup of hot chocolate and piece of pecan pie  
his name is rudy ( short for rudolph , in all likelihood  
see , it's called reindeer games  
get it ? 
get it ? 
shut up  ) 
in the past , affleck has been at his best as a supporting actor , and reindeer games does nothing to further his viability as a leading man  
step two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible : gary sinise's villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook a filmmaker could have some up with  
he's dirty and potty-mouthed , he's got long , scruffy hair and a goatee , and i fully expected him to walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them  
he's also extremely inept at what he does  
he thinks garish cowboy costumes and santa suits make acceptable disguises , and he trusts affleck's character to pull through even after , time and time and time again , he tricks him and lies to him and nearly kills him  
but instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role , sinise seems to think he's playing some sort of tough , smart , and smooth criminal mastermind , rather than the complete moron that was obviously written into the script  
[on a side note , gary sinise wins this week's "" title ! "" 
award , as he's the one who gets to awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings  
last week's winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards  ] 
how to take your bad idea and make things worse : include two or three plot twists that , instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent , make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely  
this is a bad movie  
and what's worse is that , except for a few moments near the not-so-stunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous , reindeer games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad  
if they'd done that much , at least i would have been entertained "

okay , how about with this : starship troopers is one of the worst movies to hit theaters in a long time  
in fact , it might even be the worst * major * release film to come out in years    
or even a decade  
this is bad beyond belief  
i would * not * suggest paying money to see this  
there's a good chance you'll regret it  
if you see it for free , you could still want to walk out  
go right ahead  
the movie starts off with cheesy 90210 scenes set in the future world of    buenos aires  
here we meet the group of horrendously bad actors and actresses playing obnoxious , easy-to- * despise * -with-a-passion characters that have love triangles , love rectangles , and love hexagons screwing up their life  
before long they all go off and join the military , primarily in the interest of having sex with the other youngsters that joined  
they train  
they strut around nude for no reason whatsoever  
after an hour of making the audience scream in agony , they start fighting bugs  
the big bugs look nice , even though their design is only "" okay  "" 
unfortunately , the fights are boring since we * want * all of the characters dead anyway  
cue more agony  
then some characters have sex  
then some more die  
 * * * who cares ? ? ? * * * 
cue more agony  
the movie ends , the audience runs out to their cars , vomits over the pavement , and attempts to drive home  
unfortunately , after that torture , they can't think straight , don't pay attention to the road , and many are in ugly car wrecks  
you remember how batman & robin was bad ? 
well , batman & robin kicked this movie's sorry butt , people  
starship troopers does not succeed as an action movie  
it does not succeed as a drama  
it does not succeed as a war movie  
it does not succeed as a comedy  
it does not succeed as a satire  
it does not succeed as a parody  
it succeeds as being horrible  
terrible  
gut-wrenchingly bad  
i wanted to run away from that movie every minute  
but i paid my money and i owed it to others to see if the movie got any better  
so i stayed  
it never got better  
frequently , it did the impossible , and got * worse *  
the movie as written , acted , directed , and basically just feels as a whole like it's about on the mental maturity level of a free willy 4  the whole thing feels like a movie that only three-year-olds could enjoy    
except for the ridiculously gratuitous blood and gore , and pointless nudity  
it's written for little children , but children should definitely * not * go anywhere near it  
of course , i recommend the same for everyone  
don't go anywhere near it  
verhoeven's got a streak going now  
his last movie was showgirls  
he seems to be trying to see how bad his movies can get before people finally stop coming  
showgirls was a failure , but it appears that , though it'll be lucky to make near its budget , this movie will still do okay gross-wise  
is it really * all * bad ? 
well , no  
troopers has about four or five lines of dialouge/short humorous scenes that are actually funny , mostly from the "" do you want to know more ? "" 
commercials that pop up throughout the story , promoting the joys of the joining the troopers  
so that adds up to about 30 seconds of entertainment and still about one hour , 59 minutes , and 30 seconds of miserable torture  
i'm totally confused as to the way that some people are really enjoying this movie  
but i do admit it  
so , if you're willing to possibly put yourself through torture , go ahead and see it , and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it  
i don't know how anyone or any * thing * could love this movie , but hey , to each his own  
feel free to give it a shot  
of course , in the interest of saving your souls , i don't recommend it  
but guess what ? 
alien resurrection comes out november 26th , and , having already seen some of it and having read the script , i assure you that it will blow pretty much everyone away  
though opinion on starship troopers is reasonably split , it'll be difficult to find someone that * won't * like alien resurrection when they've seen it "

the following review contains some harsh language * * * 
the blair witch project  
quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time  
if you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace , because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy  
my colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more , then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more  
and this worked for him  
well , i'm sorry , but nothing    
is nothing ! ! ! ! ! 
nothing is not more  
it's nothiiiiiinggggggggggg ! ! ! ! ! !  
i do not pay 5 dollars to see nothing  
 "" nothing "" is free , available all around the world at a location near you  
i am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary  
i could just discount them and say , "" well , i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow  "" 
but i have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesn't hold water  
there must be some other reason  
 ( then again , maybe my first thought is correct , i think i'll try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction  ) 
when i hear people praising this film , i never hear them talking about what makes up about 97% of this movie : three kids bickering with each other about being lost  
they only talk about what might make up possibly 3 to 4 minutes of screen time  
this being a few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout "" josh ! ! "" 
over and over  
this film should not be called the blair witch project , it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost    
and argue with each other  
oh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting "" josh ! ! ""  
and if you thought that was scary , wait till you see a pile of rocks , and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs , oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear  
oh yeah , and some goo on one of their backpacks  
you've never seen terror like this folks , and you don't want to  
the chevy chase/goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film  
 ( for current films , i highly recommend the sixth sense or a stir of echoes for a creepy filmgoing experience  ) 
this film is an example of marketing with no substance  
the marketing was brilliant , and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film  
they want this film to be good  
and i think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they don't have anything else to praise  
that wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along , but this is not it  
this film could have been so much better  
just think , if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost , and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff  
i saw this movie with a girl who was extremely pumped for it  
she was sold on this film  
and then , at one point during it , she turned to me and asked '    are 
we supposed to be scared by this ? '  
i've heard one opinion that you "" have to use your imagination "" to create the fear in this movie  
well , i thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed to do  
use their imagination and create a good movie  
i mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay 5 bucks for it  
but even if you like this idea , then what are you imagining ? 
an entity called the blair witch ? 
some rednecks fucking with these kids ? 
are either of these things really scary when you think about it ? ? ? 
i've heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it can be to be out in the woods and hear something  
well sure thats scary in real life , but there are a lot of things that are scary in real life that are not scary in a movie nor even interesting  
you could sit in your house and see a snake or a spider and it could be scary , but in a film it wouldn't be  
and no , a movie does not need a big budget or cgi special effects to be scary or creepy  
actually the less the better ( see the equally awful remake of the haunting )  
but you have to do something  
you cant just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this could be scary , if it were real  
and by the way , about the shakycam filming in blair witch  
aren't these supposed to be "" filmmakers "" who should know how to point a camera and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly ? 
i'm not even talking about the couple scenes where they are terrified , that's justified  
i'm talking about the other 87 minutes of the movie where they can't seem to shoot anything smoothly at all  
minor quibble there  
there is a feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers  
that the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way to the bank  
and i think there is a good chance they will see this film again and say to themselves "" what was i thinking ? ? ""  
but , if they don't , then thats fine "

truth be told , "" supernova "" wasn't quite as bad as i thought it might be  
maybe i just felt sorry for the actors , or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn't started tinkering with the director's ( walter hill ) final cut , causing him to want his name removed  
maybe i'm becoming a softy  
in any case , i didn't find "" supernova "" as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe  
but it's still bad  
the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel "" nightingale  "" 
the crew includes captain a  j  
marley ( robert forster ) , his new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) and danika lund ( robin tunney ) , and computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz )  
there are some attempts at "" characterization , "" but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female )  
don't expect any more explanation , because you won't get it  
anyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent  
during the dimension jump ( i think that's what it's called , but don't hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board  
he calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with  
then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening  
have you seen "" alien ? "" 
have you seen "" event horizon "" ( a lame movie in its own right ) ? 
good  
then you've seen "" supernova  "" 
post-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either  
after all , no one's going to think for a second that troy won't turn out to be a villain  
but the bigger problem with "" supernova "" is that it can' t just stick to the simple plot it's afforded  
numerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it's a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped  
was there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ? 
did the ship's computer learn something about humanity ? 
what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ? 
and just what does the film's title signify , if anything ? 
as far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn't developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements  
character relationships in this film also make very little sense  
for some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex  
we get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes  
bassett and spader's characters start off hating each other  
fifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they're engaging in some hanky-panky  
when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him  
every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut  
the most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits ! 
furthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits  
maybe that's why the film's title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster  
right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you're seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations  
the rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b  point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby  
point b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing  
doesn't make sense  
since i didn't understand anything about these characters' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ? 
not a whit  
it's a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do  
they don't find it  
bassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces  
sexual tension ? 
more like constipation  
maybe they're just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as "" this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice  "" 
not that we ever find out who that is , mind you  
the climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film's biggest forehead-slapper  
as troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected  
he' s awfully one-note , but it's not as if he's given any more notes to work with  
the rest of the cast does even less  
tunney stands around looking cute , then scared  
phillips broods  
cruz flirts with the computer  
then they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn't paying much attention by then  
 "" supernova "" is pretty awful , but i'm cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got  
that's it  
if you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you'll probably hate it more than i will  
even the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn't going to save the film  
honestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ? 
it usually results in a bad movie , and that's what "" supernova "" is "

the premise of both the movie and the television series is two fbi agents who investigate the paranormal ; fox mulder ( david duchovny ) is the avid believer whose quest to find the truth about extraterrestrial life borders on the paranoid , and dana scully ( gillian anderson ) is the scientific skeptic trying to find a rational explanation to mulder's flights of fancy

a "" shadow government "" is aware of this , but tries to cover-up the alien existence  
mulder and scully know "" the truth is out there , "" and so try to expose both the invasion and the cover-up  
there are three central questions i have heard asked about this movie : 1  
will those who don't watch the series be able to understand the movie ? 
yes  
isolated as an individual text , the x-files can stand alone  
they have given enough background for anyone , familiar with the show or not , to understand the movie  
although some of the secondary characters' histories may confuse the uninitiated , those characters are not essential to the film  
this is a major problem : they trot out token secondary characters from the series out for an appearance and then disappear just as quickly  
why bring superintendent skinner into the picture in the first place , and then have him sat silently on an fbi internal affairs committee ? 
why bring in "" the lone gunmen , "" three computer geek conspiracy theorists , for an even briefer appearance ? 
these characters are recurrent on the series , and their appearance in the film was met with whoops from the audience ( suggesting their popularity among fans - actually most of the audience could pass for "" the lone gunmen "" )  
still , then they vanish just as quickly  
2  the television show never gives us any answers  
will the movie actually explain some things ? 
yes  
in the x-files we get a fairly complete history of "" the black ooze , "" what it is and what it wants  
we finally get some understanding of the motivations behind the "" shadow government  "" 
there are even some subtle tie-ins with contemporary ufo-ology , including the "" greys "" and the roswell crash of 1947  
3  is the movie any good ? 
no  the x-files is a dreadful movie and shows some fundamental problems with writer/creator chris carter's talents and the relationship between cinema and television  
first off , the screenplay by series creator chris carter is sloppy and cliched  
after approximately forty-five minutes ( the length of a television episode minus the commercials ) , the pace drops to a snail's crawl  
not long after that point , when carter attempts to answer some questions we have had about the series , we wish he had not  
the explanations are so trite and ridiculous that one would have preferred it had carter not explained quite so much  
i am willing to suspend my disbelief a fair bit , but the absurdity carter wants me to swallow was just too much  
breaking the suspension of disbelief destroys the movie - and listening to other fans leave the cinema , maybe the series too  
the explanations are not only absurd , they are tired and unoriginal  
the extraterrestrials breed and gestate like those from the alien series , and their craft looks like a leftover set piece from independence day  
note that the alien movies , id4 , and the x-files are all from 20thcentury fox - a studio that is beginning to cannibalize itself i think  
the x-files is noteworthy for being the only movie based on a television series to be produced while the series was still running  
in comparing the movie and television series certain aspects of the respective media emerge  
the avoidance of the series to answer the questions it raised annoyed and frustrated many people  
however , i rather liked that about the series  
television allows you to impose as much , or as little , meaning on a show as you want  
it is the proverbial "" blank screen "" which we project our minds on  
meaning on television is open and ambiguous ; it is the nature of the medium  
cinema , on the other hand , is the opposite  
it projects onto us the filmmakers mind  
we can , in some films , fill the textual gaps ourselves , but that almost never happens in an american film  
meaning , in cinema , needs to be self-contained and determined  
so , when the x-files made that jump from small to big screen , carter needed to take into consideration the differences in the medium as well  
he did not  
by making explicit , what the television show left implicit , carter reveals the limits of his creativity and skill  
when they say that "" fans "" make a tv show , it is not far from the truth  
on television , fan culture must impose its meanings on the text because there is nothing there  
how true that is when we see the "" explicit "" x-files - there is nothing there

director : george lucas cast : liam neeson , ewan mcgregor , natalie portman , jake lloyd , ian mcdiarmid , samuel l  jackson , oliver ford davies , terence stamp , pernilla august , frank oz , ahmed best , kenny baker , anthony daniels screenplay : george lucas producers : rick mccallum runtime : 131 min  
us distribution : 20th century fox rated pg : mild violence , thematic elements 
copyright 1999 nathaniel r  atcheson 
a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review  
i've attempted to obey this rule in recent months , but to do so would be impossible in this case  
the fact is , nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them  
the original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people  
for me , they calibrated my creativity as a child ; they are masterful , original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time ( and they still hold up pretty darn well )  
i am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release , but that doesn't make me any less dedicated to it  
on the contrary , the star wars trilogy -- and the empire strikes back in particular -- are three items on a very short list of why i love movies  
when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine-film series , i got exited  
when i first saw screenshots from the film , well over a year ago , i embarked on a year-long drool of anticipation  
and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving , i was ready to see the film  
but then there was the hype , the insane marketing campaign , and lucasfilm's secretive snobbery over the picture  
in the last weeks before the picture opened , while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater , i was tired of hearing about it  
i was tired of seeing cardboard cut-outs of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell  
i just wanted to see the movie  
reader , do not misunderstand  
i did not have an anti-hype reaction  
the hype was unavoidable  
i understand and accept the hype -- it's just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released  
five minutes into the phantom menace , i knew there was a problem  
 "" who are these jedi knights ? "" 
i asked  
 "" why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine-gun rapidity ? "" 
 "" why aren't these characters being developed before their adventures ? "" 
 "" why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film ? "" 
these were just some of my questions early on  
later , i asked , "" where's the magic of the first three films ? "" 
and "" why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes ? ' 
by the end of the film , i was tired , maddened , and depressed  
george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless , mindless , summer blockbuster  
the phantom menace is no star wars film  
take away the title and the jedi talk and the force , and you're left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time  
it's an embarrassment  
i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored , or a new theme is examined , or a special effects shot isn't used  
there are a few of each , but they're all token attempts  
the fact is , george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects  
this is not what i wanted to see  
i didn't want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth , but i did  
the story centers mostly around qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson , looking lost and confused ) and his apprentice , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor , who scarcely has a line in the film ) and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo  
naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation ; their contact on naboo is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people  
after picking up jar jar binks ( a completely cgi character , voiced by ahmed best ) , they head to tatooine , where they meet young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his mother ( pernilla august )  
qui-gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin , and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys  
the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious , neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters  
there isn't anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form  
the way lucas has handled it , however , it unsatisfactory  
first of all , we don't learn one single thing about qui-gon jinn  
not one thing  
what was his life like before this film ? 
well , i imagine he didn't have one  
that's why he feels like a plot device  
this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role , and why he's recently retired from film ( i don't blame him , honestly )  
obi-wan , a character i was really looking forward to learning more about , is even less interesting  
mcgregor has just a few lines , so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere  
since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace , lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie  
things start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine ; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed-out character in the film , and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role  
i was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene ; rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting  
and when anakin says goodbye to his mother , i found it moving  
also fairly good is portman , and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written  
jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i've ever had to endure , but he's more interesting than most of the humans  
as soon as the relatively-brief segment on tatooine is over , it's back to the mind-numbing special effects and depthless action scenes  
i've seen many movies that qualify as "" special effects extravaganzas , "" but the phantom menace is the first one i've seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie  
the reason is obvious : george lucas has no restraint  
i can't say that i didn't find the effects original , because i did -- the final battle between darth maul , obi-wan , and qui-gon is visually exceptional , as is most of the film  
but i also found the effects deadening and tiresome  
my breaking point was near the end of the picture , as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters ; in the background , we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky , and i wanted that to go away  
can't we have one stinking scene that isn't bursting at the seems with a special effects shot ? 
i got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours  
and then there's the question of magic  
what was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi ? 
i have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel  
john williams' familiar score is no help , nor is lucas' direction  
i think it comes right down to characters : there are none here "

-1,"years ago , robin williams made _jumanji_ , a brilliant achievement in special effects , but a travesty on nearly every other level  
the same can be said for _what dreams may come_ , a boring , illogical , weepie-wannabe that left my senses numb  
don't get me wrong : i love breathtaking special effects and pulse-pounding imagery  
_brazil_ is on my personal top ten  
_the city of lost children_ is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios  
i even love _2001_ and _last year at marienbad_ , being in the minority amidst my friends  
_what dreams may come_ , imagery aside , has little daring thought to complement its imagery  
the daring thought it _does_ have is never fully realized  
it's idea of a plot is so lukewarm , that it insults the bigger questions it raises  
it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences , put on an electronica soundtrack , and sell it as one of those popular _mind's eye_ videos  
robin williams plays chris nielsen , who dies too prematurely--not only in the story , but before we have a chance to really know and care for him  
the director , vincent ward , and the screenwriter ronald bass , have chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience with the afterlife  
big mistake  
it would have been far better to take the half-hour or so needed to tell his life story first ( ala _it's a wonderful life_ ) , so that i can build up respect for him , so i could know and possibly care for him , his children , and his long-suffering wife ( played superbly by annabella sciorra )  
instead , the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story , expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses  
it doesn't  
so in the afterlife , chris learns that ( a ) people still don't meet god , ( b ) that our thoughts are reality , and ( c ) time does not exist there  
hmm    
i+ll grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative  
 ( the "" not meeting god "" part still irks at me , but perhaps there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect )  
that said , this alternate reality still makes no possible sense  
read on    
chris' wife commits suicide  
since suicides go to hell , chris would be separated from his wife forever  
the important question is , is heaven really heaven if you are separated from the one you love ? 
good question  
and i like good thought-provoking questions  
i don+t like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question  
i _loathe_ it when the filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes a popular rescue film , especially a rescue film which does not take its underlying premise seriously  
i _really_ loathe it when it+s story is no longer run by logic , but by special effects  
hey chris : did you forget ? 
your thoughts are _real_  
they are more _real_ than the physical world , according to the new-age screenplay  
so , why don+t you conjure up positive thoughts of annie , and let that run wild ? 
and then she would appear before you , and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity ? 
because there would be no movie , that+s why  
and albert the angel ( played by miscast cuba gooding , jr  ) says bluntly : "" that+s fantasy  "" 
umm    
if your thoughts are more real than the physical , then fantasy is not fantasy , but real  
surely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that  
and if you happen to think that you are an unimaginative person , and that your thoughts aren't big enough to sustain you for eternity , well , in all due respect , that's why i don't subscribe to this theology  
all due respect  
another idea , based on "" time , ( pause ) , does not exist here ! "" 
so chris , spend your eternity with annie , as she is on earth , reliving your favorite memories , or hang out with her when she was growing up  
you+ve got eternity : perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not to freak her out  
and forcing her to write "" i still exist "" in her diary , imo , is just too tacky  
there are many other ideas , all of which are a hundred times better than what+s unraveled in the plot  
the great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before , and just come out stale  
most insulting is the subplot where important people in chris+ life appear in heaven differently than he expects , so when they finally show themselves , he realizes they were with him all along  
and when this happens , the film runs in slow motion , as if to build emotion  
_gag me with a spoon_  
so the only things for me to like are sciorra+s effective performance , who rises far above this mundane material , and the special effects  
please note that while i enjoyed some of the visuals , i did not enjoy _all_ of them : some of the images looked like sandy duncan universe , everybody floating up and down in invisible strings  
it sounds like a joke , but it+s really true : i really tried to block out the dialogue , and figure out what music would best work as an alternative soundtrack  
my vote goes to a rare cd called "" never say die "" ( 1981 ) from petra , a christian rock group  
it+s pretty good , and they have a song about annie , who commits suicide  
 ( it+s too late for annie/she+s gone away for good/there+s so much we'd have told her/and now we wish we could/but it+s too late    )  
melancholic , yes  
depressing , yes  
but far more entertaining "

i was about forty-five minutes into this one at a friend's house when he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house  
so i never got to finish the movie and i'm sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of a bad movie  
but i can at least get a partial review out of it , because i saw enough to know this one wasn't worth finishing in the first place  
the movie centers around a freaky teenager who's spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents' house  
when grandpa dies ( taking his department store down with him ) , social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder ( first and middle names ? 
gold bond ) to a state home , where we find out he's a different from the other kids  
actually , we find out he's different when we first see him , because he's the most pale individual we've ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever  
when powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie , the father takes one look at him and says "" he's not my son  "" 
obviously  
all i want to know is where the pillsbury dough boy was nine months ago  
so the white-faced freak leaves his neverland ranch for the state home and faces the ridicule of other kids  
that is , until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him "" wear "" his spoon ( "" you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass  "" 
decisions , decisions    ) and he uses telepathic powers to draw all the silverware in the room into a giant pile in the middle of the table  
so if his father is the pillsbury dough boy , his mother must be sissy spacek's carrie character  
and you have to factor in two more things from the subsequent scenes , as we find out powder has some sort of super-intelligence ( "" your i  q  
test went straight off the chart ! "" ) 
and attracts electrical power  
this first shows up as powder visits the world of high school ( if he's such a genius already , why would he need a high school education ? ) and sits through a demonstration in jeff goldblum's science class  
goldblum plugs in a "" jacob's ladder "" device that shows current running up two wires and immediately the current flows across the room and into powder's chest  
but goldblum just stands there for about thirty seconds watching , instead of just unplugging the damn thing  
i guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in a row ( following hideaway and nine months )  
that's about all i saw before the big fight began and , let me tell you , that was twice as interesting as the movie itself  
but like i said , i saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization  
none of these movies ever handle the subject properly , instead introducing the feeble beauty and the beast copout of having a beautiful woman fall in love with the guy's personality , overlooking his personal appearance  
i already had the female character picked out ( the girl who was sitting next to him in the back of the room during the electrocution scene ) , but i guess i'll never know for sure what happened

the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films  
in a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous  
with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong's best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u  s  productions  
such talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results  
now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai  
unfortunately "" romeo must die "" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong's rhythms  
the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking  
enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong )  
kai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai's boss and leader of the local chinese family  
a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down  
it's not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends  
the following morning po sing is found dead  
suspicions escalate , as issac o'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder  
his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture  
issac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter  
the scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder  
he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined  
hung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work  
escaping to the u  s  han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother's death  
 "" romeo must die "" is in many ways a fun film  
it is both absurd and assured  
the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes "" the godfather ""  
the relationship between jet li's han and aaliyah's trish o'day reminds us of abel ferrera's "" china girl "" , except that romeo must die's couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another  
their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history  
the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable  
li , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination  
allayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace  
it's obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic  
but , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it  
delro lindo as issac o'day carries himself well in the film  
an unsung and under appreciated actor , mr  lindo turns out the films best performance  
the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d  b  woodside as issac's son , colin  
the performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in  
an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written  
first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film  
having a career as one of the industry's best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and "" romeo must die "" does look good  
but the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes  
the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in  
the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing  
and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah's bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever  
the best things about the film are its fight scenes  
jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles  
one needs only to see his film "" fist of legend "" to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat  
here , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that "" lethal weapon 4 "" ( jet's u  s  debut ) didn't allow  
unfortunately , a lot of jet's fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision  
also "" romeo must die "" must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x-ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent  
obviously a homage to the famed x-ray scene from sonny chiba's "" streetfighter "" , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film  
it's as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted  
one problem though about the fight scenes  
those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon  
they do have an internal rhythm to them  
a heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography  
the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance  
this is created by the performance , the direction and the editing  
here in "" romeo must die "" , there is no staccato "
-1,"a hotshot lawyer gets an obviously guilty child molester acquitted , and shortly after during the victory celebration gets offered an opportunity to show his prowess in new york city  
the lawyer , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is not offered a job yet , he is asked to simply pick a jury  
he accepts  
the jury he selects work out well and before long he is offered a job with the firm  
making his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money , but a gorgeous apartment  
he convinces his wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) to make the move to new york  
the first case given to him is a big test ; a "" winless "" case concerning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement  
the charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal  
his new boss and partner in the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing , explaining many of his philosophies on law , women and sex , and angles the promise of a blissful , wealthy life  
kevin's next case is a dream case , given to him by milton himself ( much to the chagrin to his colleagues ) , defending a triple murder suspect who has had a history of problems with the law  
although kevin's career is taking off , his home life is not doing very well  
mary ann is starting to have numerous problems  
she is experiencing severe depression over kevin's long hours , and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls , their faces becoming horribly disfigured  
kevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife  
he does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with , then focus all of his attention on his wife  
not helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer ( connie nielson ) also working with the firm  
mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home  
kevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife , and gets disturbing news from his mother ( judith ivey ) about the mystery concerning the identity of his father  
he also starts to lose control of his case  
kevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man  
that man is his boss , mr  milton , a truly evil character who just may be the devil himself  
kevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store  
but how do you defeat the devil ? 
why is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd ? 
do filmmakers really believe that "" normal "" courtroom drama doesn't fit the bill and they have to juice them up ? 
the courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in a real courtroom , which wouldn't have been too bad if it weren't keanu reeves trying to pull it off  
i give reeves credit for trying hard , but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character , just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short  
charlize theron defines the term "" over-the-top "" in her performance as mary ann lomax , a disappointment in contrast to her good performance in "" 2 days in the valley ""  
the only good performance in the movie is by al pacino , but i kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess ? 
maybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil , and you can tell he is having fun doing so , but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him  
it's pretty standard stuff , including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom  
please read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled , but i have to get something off of my chest  
in 1986 i remember watching a movie called "" wisdom "" with emilio estevez and demi moore , and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do  
what i like to call "" guess what , it was all a dream "" scenario  
in "" wisdom "" the two lead characters are killed at the end , only to have one of the characters "" wake up "" from an apparent and say "" gosh , i'm glad that didn't really happen ! ""  
i considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with  
well , the same thing happens in "" the devils advocate "" , and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream ( perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan , since it failed and he is the devil ) , but the point is that the last 90% of the film didn't happen  
i know it's a stretch , after all it is a movie and nothing really happened , but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that  
of course , the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one  
as i recall , "" wisdom "" was a decent film  
 "" the devil's advocate "" is not  
the devils advocate 
directed by taylor hackford john milton                   al pacino kevin lomax         "

 "" it's just    
the way    
we are  "" 
--- a rapist ( matt frewer ) responds to supergirl's ( helen slater ) query as to why she's being attacked , an example of the mind-numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl  
i'll admit it    
i love superman iii  
i know it's hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor , but i still think it's a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise  
supergirl , a spin-off film of sorts from the series' same producers ( alexander and ilya salkind ) , doesn't even rival superman iii in terms of quality , let alone superman or superman ii  
supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time  
as the film begins we see the residents of argo city , a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in "" inner space "" , go about their daily lives  
ok    
what ? 
so these are exiles from krypton , which blew up right ? 
were they living there before krypton exploded ? 
how do you get to "" inner space "" ? 
this whole "" inner space "" notion is never explained , particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world  
how do they know where superman went ? 
how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ? 
these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me  
argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron  
one day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o' toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman's cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art  
kara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of "" whatever "" that protects the city  
in the chaos , the omegahedron sails out through the opening , dooming the argonians to death    
in three days time , or something  
kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world  
the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who , immediately before her dip was ruined , announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook )  
selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination  
selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she's arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume )  
supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives  
ok    
huh ? 
why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ? 
attention movie : explain yourself ! 
i'm sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much  
i can't buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to  
knowing that she needs a secret identity , supergirl basically "" wills "" herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle ) , picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school  
she's given her dorm assignment , and who happens to be her roommate ? 
lois lane's sister , lucy  
ok , coincidence is one thing folks , but we're getting really contrived now  
what follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks    
complete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason , of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! )  
best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks  
at this point i'm rapidly wondering why i'm bothering with this nonsense  
there is some credit to give to the film however  
one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an "" evil "" bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its "" prey "" is very well done  
also , its commendable to see genders reversed in the film , whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools  
hart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara's love interest , a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film's more ridiculous moments , when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some "" menacing "" bumper cars )  
then there were numerous little things that bothered me  
the flying effects are never convincing for a moment    
it's all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires  
instead of having her look like she's flying , the filmmakers wanted her to be "" graceful "" , so she poses a lot and does ballet-type maneuvers  
also , who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth ? 
a pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a "" wacky "" demise  
there is also some rampant product placement in the film , most notably for popeye's , tylenol , and a&w root beer , with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? ! )  
finally , just one word : monsters  
faye dunaway and peter o'toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o'toole overacts he's entertaining and when dunaway does it she's annoying ( her character actually says the line "" seize them ! "" 
at one point )  
dunaway's henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty's otis character from the first two superman movies  
helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she's written to be , as she's able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable  
believability aside though , it's still annoying  
now despite all this negativity ( and i'm not alone here "

but what did you expect when you clicked on this title ? 
 * * * 
cast : kristen holly smith , danica sheridan , alex boling , michael dotson , sonya hensley , janet krajeski , sabrina lu , dionysius burbano , calvin grant , jeff b  harmon written and directed by : jeff b  harmon running time : 97 minutes 
 "" the thought of losing you makes me all vomity inside  "" 
--- blatz balinski ( danica sheridan ) laments the fact that her lesbian lover , april ( kristen holly smith ) , has just received a telegram from her ex-fiance  
isle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot ( smith ) , a resident of the small town of bumfuck , arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson ( michael dotson )  
when april gets extreme cold feet she runs home , sticks a gun in her mouth , and pulls the trigger  
instead of killing herself , she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos , an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed ( except for lance , the homosexual toilet cleaner/slave )  
april loves her new home and friends , but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up  
mr  and ms  pfferpot ( director jeff b  harmon and janet krajeski ) decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr  sigmoid colon ( also jeff b  harmon ) , who claims he can cure homosexuality  
in actuality , dr  colon is homosexual as well and begins his special "" treatment "" on dick dickson ( unbeknownst to dick )  
when april turns down dick's demand for her to return to bumfuck , he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambo-style  
instead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance ( alex boling ) and the two of them , along with april and her lover blatz , get married  
 ( note to the filmmaker : why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i'm assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided ? ) 
april's parents , feeling like there is no recourse , call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer ) their way  
the bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the "" circuitry "" and they re-wire it and send it back to washington d  c  , destroying it  
mr  and ms  pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own  
i'm not sure if writer/director/co-star jeff b  harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs  
either way , he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie  
the film opens with a preacher running a small african-american child out of town , and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan ( during a jaunty musical number ) , preceded by remarks about "" gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others , such as the jews ""  
if harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be , then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film , but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can't help but feel like he had some serious intent  
as for the entire central theme of the movie , i'm afraid that it's one that i just don't get  
i tried to keep an open mind while watching it , but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes  
it was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society  
how does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non-acceptance ? 
i'm not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society , but don't force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren't going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me  
again , maybe i'm missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make , but if so , i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully  
as far as musical comedies go , isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical , but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy  
despite the disturbing visuals , "" mom and apple pie "" stuck with me for the rest of the day  
speaking of disturbing visuals , "" wedding bells ain't ringing "" could have been a decent song , but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying  
 "" i'm a lesbian "" ( which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular ) is also pretty good , but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms  smith  
it's mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based  
the other performers are decent , save for the rosie o'donnell like performance given by danica sheridan  
i have no inherent problem with her character ; it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired  
one particular musical number , "" lesbian rock "" , was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film-going life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan  
the film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll  
the remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs ( "" lesbian rock "" included ) and the ridiculously presented anti-nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film  
once the "" isle of lesbos reprise "" was reached , i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all  
why was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end ? 
isle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www  indie-underground  com  
the transfer is pretty clean ( and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent ) and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1  85 : 1  
in many respects , isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential ( like a rocky horror for the new millennium )  
this film is by no means my cup of tea , but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it  
if you think it might be for you , then by all means seek it out  
i , on the other hand , will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator    
wait  aren't gladiator films considered to be   "

-1,"in the continuation of warner brother's franchise , joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow  
what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film  
avika goldsman's screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another  
this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as "" the client "" is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke  
situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another  
this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone's batgirl , who just happens to be alfred's niece  
the story of dr  victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought  
while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife , dr  freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure , and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment  
now of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live  
now the logic of that little sub-plot escapes me  
if mr  freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death , why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth  
this is indeed a cold hearted man  
the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory  
she wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal  
she joins with mr  freeze in his plan to start a new ice age , destroying all animal life , therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them  
the characters have no logic  
batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films  
now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward / robin , bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure , constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships , while at the same time not really having any  
george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him  
to say that his performance is workman-like is to be generous  
his best performances are still on "" e  r  ""  
bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend ( played by elle macpherson ) , that it brings into question bruce's latent homosexuality  
there is no spark and no passion ( as there was for nicole kidman's psychologist in "" batman forever "" ) between bruce and anyone other than alfred  
and even that relationship is very reserved  
robin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series  
now he's just a spoiled kid  
in "" batman forever "" , burt ward wanted to be batman's partner and friend  
now , robin is suffering from ego deficiency  
robin's attraction for poison ivy is not believable , except for a boy around the age of 15  
his later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest , even though they are not related in a traditional sense  
chris o'donnell , once considered a rising star , successfully burns up on reentry with this performance  
his robin needs nothing more than a good spanking  
the less said about alicia silverstone's performance the better  
this talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film  
she was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it  
this brings us to the villains  
arnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday  
the most rediculous scene is during mr  freeze's imprisonment  
the guards are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film  
it's almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as a gang member  
umu thurman struts and coos her way through her part , showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status  
her poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in "" sextette "" ( 1978 )  
the only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough  
these two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film  
without going through the intricacies of the plot , there is one question that always comes to mind with this series ( except for the first "" batman "" ) , and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel  
mr  freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video  
every villain ( even the minor ones ) have to have a look , no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume  
with this film , warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to it's tv incarnation  
the only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows ! , 
gwaaaa's , and clang's associated with the old series  
you almost wonder if william dozier , producer of the tv series is collecting royalties from this film  
the special effects ( by john dykstra ) and production design ( by barbara ling ) are the primary stars of this film  
and it is a case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing  
every set , from ivy's lair , the batcave , to freeze's hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for years to come  
there is no one realistic set or set piece in the film  
everything is set for maximum exposure  
the special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have  
there are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on "" the time machine "" ( the growing plant scene ) but these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured "

-1,"movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good , the bad , and the despicable  
i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in '95 , but i wanted to re-write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics  
we need to be warned about some truly awful films , too  
this picture was so bad , it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below )  
the only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno  
so , it does indeed have some plusses    
in fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff  
and her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone  
this character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ? ) 
far too annoying far too often  
like in 1998s "" bulworth "" , when the movie was over i didn't care one little iota about the main character  
at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though  
 "" showgirls "" is too stupid to make a statement  
some people claim that the story is based on the legendary "" all about eve "" of all things ! 
if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l  mankiewicz was , he'd be    well , 
he'd be a good screenwriter  
instead , this project may have sunk his career  
he wrote the ( ha ha ! ) 
script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed  
the same team who created a good sex-film in 1992 ( "" basic instinct "" ) struck out here with their occasional violence , gratuitous x-rated sex scenes , and numerous ( and quite unnecessary ) lesbian overtones  
the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer  
after the supposed street-smart young "" lady "" gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack-jawed yokel in the opening sequence , she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the "" stardust hotel ""  
nomi doesn't take advantage of this contact to break into the big-time of dirty dancing right away  
first , she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club  
she sells her hot little wares at "" the cheetah "" for a short time , turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience  
hey , i never said she wasn't a hot number    
maybe it's that , her body , which gets her into the big-time when the star of the "" stardust hotel "" , crystal connors ( gina gershon ) stops into the strip club ( it certainly isn't her brains or pleasant disposition ! )  
crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend ( kyle maclachlan )  
he also happens to be the pleasure-seeking worm who runs the big show  
crystal gets nomi onto the "" stardust "" team and , after an interminable amount of time , nomi "" earns "" the role of crystal's understudy  
the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal  
it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she's "" not a whore ""  
that's a phrase we hear a few different times and it's completely ludicrous  
of course she is ! 
she sells her soul to make it big , but in the end we're supposed to believe that she's a better person than that  
we're supposed to root for her  
no way ! 
she's a tramp and a back-stabber who deserved nothing--least of all vindication in the    ahem    climax  
she is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is  
the sub-plot with a male dancer ( glenn plummer ) who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more  
it sure ain't character development ! 
plummer also appeared in "" speed "" in '94 in a smaller , yet better role  
this sub-plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control  
kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay-day or his standards have dipped since appearing in "" blue velvet ""  
that picture was weird , but some critics claim it's one of the best movies of the '80s  
now ol' kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the '90s , too  
his sleazy character is important to "" showgirls "" , but we don't learn anything about him  
he uses people to get what he wants , but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie  
is he a villain ? 
who cares ! 
ultimately , this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit  
everyone must know by now about the soft-core acts of copulation , especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool  
what few reviewers take issue with is how mean-spirited this movie is  
everyone's either having sex , exacting revenge , or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge  
it's just too hard to take ( especially for over two hours )  
if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world , why couldn't verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers , grunts , and other sounds during the dance numbers ? 
it's hard to care about these people if we can't even appreciate what they're capable of doing on-stage  
berkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance and she has a great body  
after all , the world of porn is still an active , dishonourable profession  
perhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford  
oops , they're bad actors , too "

but it doesn't really make much of a difference  
deep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997  
remember when dante's peak came out in february ? 
a few months later , volcano was released  
the first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen  
the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent  
well , it's deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition  
this time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july  
of course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante's peak  
but while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film  
apparently many did , and it utterly baffles me  
to be completely honest , i haven't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life  
volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch  
deep impact doesn't just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot  
the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters  
deep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 )  
a line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above  
among these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski )  
leo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds  
he races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident  
a year passes , and nothing is heard about it again  
we are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc  
she gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell )  
she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie  
after talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help  
luckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain "" ellie "" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film    
that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled )  
before she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road  
they take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman )  
beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference  
naturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question  
and so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive  
they announce a plan called "" ark , "" which is their only hope for survival  
a computer will select 800 , 000 people at random  
these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won't kill off the entire human race  
after two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over  
the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning  
jenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom  
the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional  
it's a shame that nothing else is heartfelt  
now , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface  
the title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it ! 
by doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won't work  
director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show "" er  "" 
her major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film  
well , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one  
suggestion to ms  leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre  
much of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off  
throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours )  
it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it's that boring  
of course , leder isn't all to blame for it  
screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time  
what starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway )  
chock full of cheesy one liners ( "" you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! "" ) 
and stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again  
only one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring  
and the main plot is so outrageous that you can't figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi  
to put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation  
that's right , 80% miss , and 20% hit  
scenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic  
but the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening  
the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that's forgiveable "

-1,"when respecting a director , you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect  
woody allen has made a couple less-than good films , and he's my favorite  
even martin scorsese hasn't had a perfect track record  
kevin smith , after a smashing debut with the classic "" clerks "" stooped as low to sell-out and make the dreadful "" mallrats  "" 
i mean , so far the only director who's made several films , none of which have been bad is richard linklater ( "" slacker , "" "" dazed and confused , "" "" before sunrise , "" and "" suburbia ""    all 
which were great )  
now , i adore quentin tarantino  
his first two films were classic films , the second one being one of the greatest films of all time  
but 1995 just wasn't that good of a year for him  
he made way too many tv appearances  
he mispronounced jackie chan's name on the mtv movie awards  
and he made this film  
 ( he was also awarded an oscar , so i guess that would be a grand exception )  
robert rodriguez is also a great director ; not a brilliant one , but a cool one  
i've never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film , so i can't comment on them  
but in this crap ensemble director's film , all four give pitiful efforts  
pitiful for any director , too  
now in all fairness , ensemble director pieces never really work out  
i've never seen all of "" new york stories , "" but have heard the first two films , by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap ( i saw woody's one , which was hilarious but not totally up to par )  but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film  
exposition : a simple one - a bellhop , ted ( the totally overdone tim roth , who's a god and all , but not in this one , though he has a couple good moments ) is working on new year's eve for his first shift ( ! ! ! ) in an old fancy hotel  
he's the only one there ( again : ! ! ! ) and he only has a couple rooms ( yet again : ! ! ! )  
the old bellhop ( the seemingly immortal marc lawrence - who hated pulp fiction actually ) hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily  
as the night goes on , he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile  
yea  
 ( the short films are presented in order , btw ) : 
the missing ingredient writer/director : allison anders starring : sammi davis , amanda decadenet , valeria golino , madonna , ione skye , lili taylor , alicia witt 
this one starts it off horribly with no plot , no intrigue , and crap dialogue  
the situation is so terrible that it's physically painful to watch  
the plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is ( gasp ! ) 
stuck inside some object in their hotel room  
the witch that was supposed to bring it ( ione skye ) calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it  
yeah , that's what i said  
stupid plot , inane characters who aren't interesting at all , etc , etc , etc  the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which , in turn , it wastes pitifully  
not even actually funny for a second  
my rating ( out of 5 ) : no stars ! ! ! ! 
the wrong man writer/director : alexandre rockwell starring : david proval , jennifer beals and laurence bender 
another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on  
ted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple ( david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at "" coming back "" ) who are playing sex games  
ted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon  
but at least this has a bit of comedy in it , just not that much  
and david proval has never overacted as much  
and it's "" pulp fiction "" producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window  
a masterpiece compared to the first one , but still    
the misbehavers writer/director : robert rodriguez starring : antonio banderes , tamlyn tomita , lana mckissack , danny verduzco , salma hayek 
would a robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek's navel ? 
nope  
luckily she's on the tv dancing so we get to see her  
surprisingly enough , when i read the screenplay ( about a year before actually seeing it ) , this one seemed to have the most potential  
it was fast-paced , funny , and well , funny  
but when i watched it , it seemed anti-climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once  
antonio overacts nicely and the two kids ( lana and danny ) are funny  
but , as i said , it moves slowly and in that way , it's more painful than funny  
but the ending was stupid and funny at the same time  
oh ! 
the plot : antonio is a supposed gangster ( assumed , really ) who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife ( tomita ) go out to get drunk at a new year's party  
antonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long , but things go wrong    it 
was okay  
the man from hollywood writer/director : quentin tarantino starring : quentin tarantino , bruce willis , paul calderon and jennifer beals ( again ) 
ironically , this one could be considered the best for a bad reason : it best represents what quentin has done with this film  
he plays chester , a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge box-office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti-climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row  
they're drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn't light  
they also pay him a lot of cash  
this is so much exactly what this little film is about that it's campy  
tim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves 'cause they've had hits , major or minor  
it took quentin to realize that  
but the thing is , it doesn't seem like he realizes that "

-1,"my inner flag was at half-mast last year when nick at nite pulled "" dragnet "" reruns off the air  
sure , i'd seen them all at least once , but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra-serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv  
even though "" dragnet "" is out of circulation at the moment , we webb anti-fans still have the d  i  , a 50's propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous "" blue boy "" episode of "" dragnet  "" 
for anyone like me who got laughs out of webb's rapid-fire speeches and straight-faced seriousness , think of the d  i  
as what would happen if sgt  
joe friday ever enlisted , because he plays exactly the same character here , a no-nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long- winded , melodramatic speeches on any topic  
in this election year , i'm more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth  
the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb's office door and enters  
he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up  
the "" produced and directed by jack webb "" card pretty much goes without saying  
this is his movie all the way , and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason , i was wondering if there would even be a plot  
i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants , but the d  i  
gives us more -- much more  
webb's mission is to make a man out of private owens , the local screw-up  
the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or , the captain will "" personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself  "" 
 ( whether the "" lace panties "" part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered  ) 
this , of course , gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens' life a living hell  
for those of you who haven't been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching , here's a reprint of a typical monologue of his  
i can't duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper , but the words should at least partially convey what i'm talking about    
 "" now you listen to me , youngster  
someday you'll wake up fighting on a beach and you'll pray to god somebody doesn't get killed because of your foolishness    
i've got a headline for you : every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours , you're gonna turn around and i'll be standing right there  "" 
i couldn't write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d  i  
 ( nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame ) , but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines , like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day's work by going to the local bar ( where he orders a tomato juice )  
he meets a woman who , coincidentally , also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typically-stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch-rival , another marine d  i  
webb marches over to the table , gets up in her face and says , "" just what kind of a dame do you think you are ? "" 
bogart he ain't  
the other d  i  
gets one of the few memorable non-webb lines when he confesses to the girl , "" he's a damn good d  i  
    
i guess i'm just a little jealous  "" 
join the club , we're all jealous of jack webb's way with women , which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene , as webb finds his way to the woman's place of employment , a lingerie store , and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display  
 "" you expect me to talk to you    
in _here_ ? ! "" he exclaims , no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras  
the woman goes off to help a customer , leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen  
a little girl spots him in the store and demands , "" what are you doing in here    you're a man , aren't you ? "" 
he doesn't reply , but you know he's thinking in his head , "" what an odd species of human -- so small  
must be one of those children everyone's been talking about  "" 
this poor girl , scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb , would later swear off the male gender entirely , just one of the many lesbian conversions he's responsible for  
the movie doesn't focus too closely on webb's romance , it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie , where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills  
after two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea , webb asks owens , "" was that flea you killed a male or female ? "" 
owens replies , "" a male , sir  "" 
webb yells to the platoon , "" this ain't the one ! "" 
that such a scene ( along with the rest of the movie ) was intended to be taken seriously defies comment  
but we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d  i  , but for iwo jima , guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century  
webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie ( with the exception of owens ) were played by actual marines  
someone wanting to parody this movie couldn't do a more comical job than webb did  
it makes it all the more ironic ( like raeeyain on your wedding day ) that the man had no sense of humor himself "

-1,"my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love  
i love ralph fiennes  
i love uma thurman  
i love sean connery  
hell , i'm even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw  
i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i've been eagerly awaiting the film ever since  
a few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground  
then , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics  
and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs  
and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique  
my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things  
the film i saw today didn't even meet those expectations  
this is a lousy , incoherent mess  
i would slam it harder , if it weren't for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors  
but sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired  
that's the main problem with the avengers : for all it's hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired  
it's like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making  
it also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots  
this is just plain depressing  
the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show  
frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i've never watched an episode  
i wasn't alive then  
i don't even watch television now  
i'm very sorry that i don't have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i've already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse  
i didn't know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles  
i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film  
based on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr  peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits  
they are to work together , under mother's orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw )  
it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather  
his name is de wynter ( connery )  
he is a crazy scottish guy  
our heroes had better stop him , or else  
  
  
the weather will keep getting colder until they "" have to go to hell to warm up "" ( one of the film's few funny lines )  
along the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense  
for example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos  
now , killer bugs don't really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film  
the purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established  
they're never even directly connected to de wynter ( they're controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard )  
the special effects aren't bad , but they're loud , obnoxious , and intrusive  
like so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning  
and i guarantee you , it will wane  
i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn't do any good to think  
the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn't tell us what happens  
there are several scenes in the preview that didn't make the final cut  
in addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad )  
the scenes that don't feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast  
they aren't  
the action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film  
they aren't , either  
and what about this wasted cast ? 
oh , it makes me weep with disappointment  
we're talking ralph fiennes here , one of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever *  
i love the guy  
i've loved all his films , until this one  
he seems like he wants to understand the film , but he's as lost as we are  
and thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , can't manage to look at home here  
 ( i don't blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can't be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting  ) 
connery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter  
who is to blame ? 
is it the screenwriter , don macpherson ? 
perhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right  
is it the actors ? 
for god's sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling  
i blame director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn't have been given the task to begin with  
his best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor  
add to that a lack of experience in big-budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory "

-1,"the last line ( or near to that honor ) is the great butler , alfred ( the ubergod , michael gough ) saying , "" i think we need a bigger bat cave , "" or something to that note  
that's exactly what this film is - too big for its own good because it has too damn much  
cut batgirl out  
cut one of the villains  
it's too much to handle in one dosage  
it's so much that characters get left behind  
poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way , shape or form  
and elle deserves better  
this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher  
it's also the fourth worst in the series ( and second worst from joel )  
the series has been declining since its stunning debut , followed by the almost-as-stunning sequel and then the anti-climactic third one ( first by joel )  
this one's not anti-climactic - i knew it was gonna suck  
it's up to joel to make it fun though  
 "" batman forever "" was fun  
this is a big bore of over-produced action sequences and shallow characters  
i mean , this one bit  
i'm gonna put all the plot in one paragraph : mr  freeze ( ah-nold ) , who's wife was dying of some disease , has become the new big villain these days  
he's a huge ex-scientist who fell into some weird liquid ( hello ? 
joker ? ) and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body  
batman ( george ) and robin ( chris ) fight him a bit but find they're growing apart  
meanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he's used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had  
she emerges from her chemicals ( don't ask 'cause i can't tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who's poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people  
she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo  
meanwhile , alfred's dying of the same disease mr  freeze's wife has ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and his niece , barbara ( alicia ) , comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not really soon , it takes her 2 hours ) becomes batgirl  
meanwhile , in an unfinished subplot , bruce ( batman's alter-ego , if you forgot ) has been dating the lovely julie madison ( the even lovlier elle macpherson ) who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing  
end of her for all we know  
mr  freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population ( don't ask ! ! ! )  
the trio must team together "" as family "" to beat them  
there ya go  
not the whole story but no big context clues  
too much , right ? 
right ! 
the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels  
however , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one  
he gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that's it  
maybe some stunts  
for all this , i can't even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy ! 
and when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say  
i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode  
george is in between them  
he's not quintessential , he's not horrible , he's good  
but i'm sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they'll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we'll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job )  
the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher  
last time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey  
this time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain ( the same guy ) , mr  freeze  
we feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants ? 
arnold isn't very good - too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points  
when he watches old movies of his wife , he actually looks somber  
wow  
but uma makes the most of her seductive character , getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness  
it's like she's almost parodying herself in "" pulp fiction "" at points  
she's incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better  
as for the lower bat-people , chris is the same as he was in "" batman forever , "" although i think his work in these is too hokey when he's best at quieter parts in "" scent of a woman "" or just plain cool parts in "" fried green tomotoes  "" 
alicia - i love the girl but she's not particularly good in this film  
she can hypotheitically act , we all saw that in "" clueless , "" but her lines kinda sound weird  
and it isn't the mushy-mouth this time  
but in all fairness , she has virtually no part  
joel gets around to her occasionally and when she's on , she does stupid stuff    although 
i know i'm not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma    
and poor elle  
poor , poor elle  
i love that woman and she can also hypothetically act ( for those of us who saw "" sirens "" ) "

-1,"i went to blair witch project 2 : book of shadows with the highest of hopes  
the original film , released last summer , was genuinely scary and terrifying ; i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor  
unfortunately , my hopes were soon dashed  
as the movie opens , the audience is shown pseudo-documentary clips of burkittsville , maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie  
it's a mostly humorous , self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film  
during this segment , we are introduced to the protagonist , a young man who sells blair witch-related memorabilia from his website  
the movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously  
we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia , but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies  
we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him  
we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him  
no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution ; in fact , these scenes are barely referred to again  
i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally , a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting , filthy interiors , and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie  
the movie cuts again , this time to the present  
the young man , whose name is jeffrey ( played by jeffrey donovan -- as in the first movie , the character names are identical to the actors' names , although this movie admits up front that it is fictional , so there's no reason for the practice this time around ) , is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the "" blair witch hunt , "" which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website  
we meet tristen and steven , a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience  
steven is a skeptic , believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria  
tristen , on the other hand , believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence  
she is wan and soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly  
 ( she also complains that she feels nauseated ; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant , and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out  
how did i know ? 
because in bad movies , nauseated women are always pregnant  ) 
the fourth member of their party is erica , a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch , not evil  
they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery  
kim is dressed completely in black , has extreme goth-style makeup on , and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities , but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch  
presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; it's never explained  
the party of five heads off into the woods as promised  
they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr's house and set up camp , complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night's events  
there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well , but after a few words are exchanged , the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere  
the movie veers off at this point to spend many long , long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down  
sexual innuendoes are tossed around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consumed , and nothing much else happens  
this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary  
the next day , the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed , and that steven and tristen's manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds , like snow  
the videotapes are missing , but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim , they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house , "" right where the original blair witch tapes were found ! "" 
ooh  
spooky  
the team goes back to jeffrey's house -- a creepy old civil war-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and review the tapes  
they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night  
wacky hijinks ensue  
tristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch , everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on their bodies , steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations , and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket  
throughout the entire ordeal , jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes , which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps ; eventually tristen wanders in , mutters something about "" reverse , "" and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards  
when they do this , they discover what really happened during the five lost hours  
 ( one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes  
okay , if the videotapes were being buried , then how were they recording themselves    oh , 
nevermind  ) 
this movie was awful  
simply awful  
the characters are broadly-drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development  
erica is the nature-loving wiccan  
tristen is the weak and sympathetic woman  
steven is the overbearing asshole  
kim is the antisocial goth girl  
old , tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures  
how do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic ? 
because she's pregnant ! 
how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl ? 
because she wears a lot of eye makeup ! 
how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy ? 
because he has jagged teeth and talks like he's straight out of "" deliverance "" ! 
this is weak storytelling at its worst  
rather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic , the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics , in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action  
it didn't work  
on top of being poorly developed , most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid  
 ( "" honey , you just had a miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie  
let's get on a plane home  "" 
 "" no  
i am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and i want to find out what's going on  "" 
 "" ok  "" ) 
frankly , by the end of the movie , i was rooting for the witch  
i also felt that there was simply too much blood 'n' gore in this film  
the first movie worked by never showing us the horror  
the witch was a palpable presence in that movie , but we never saw it ; we never saw anything , in fact "

that's when the kids of that time have jobs , disposable income and a desire to re-visit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives  
check out the prices of toys from the late sixties and you'll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks  
there's a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen  
boomers are now mostly in their forties and fifties and have lived in the work-a-day world for a long time  
they'd like to re-capture some of that fun they remember from days of yore  
hollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them  
directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that time  
and for the most part they're messing it up  
 "" mission impossible "" , "" lost in space "" , "" godzilla "" , "" zorro ""  
none of these successfully capture the originals  
none of these are even good films  
you can now add "" the avengers "" to the list  
the british television series began in 1961  
super secret agent john steed ( then-patrick macnee ) and his third partner , emma peel ( then-diana rigg ) are the pair that the american audience fell for  
surrealistic and witty , the series fit the mood of the times  
the leather-clad rigg probably didn't hurt the ratings either  
after all it's not a coincidence that you can't pronounce her character's name without "" appeal ""  
now we're in the nineties  
steed ( now-ralph fiennes ) and peel ( now-uma thurman ) are battling evil genius sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) who is screwing with england's weather  
that's about as much of a plot as we have  
there's some footage about a lot of other things that either don't make sense or make even less sense  
we get betrayal for some unknown reason  
evil clones appear and vanish and have no connection to the film  
remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason  
there's a high tech hot air balloon , but i have no idea why anyone's in it  
the spy agency is run by a man called "" mother "" who is in a wheelchair and a woman named "" father "" who is blind    at 
least in some scenes  
there's probably a reason for all of this , but we'll never know it  
macnee makes an appearance of sorts  
he is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing  
a group of villains sits around a table , all clad in huge pastel-colored teddy bear outfits  
at first it's humorous to watch the teddies waddle around , but then it becomes goofy  
the movie is a medley of clutter , confusion and wrong decisions around every corner  
it feels like major portions of the film are missing  
the storyline jumps rather than flows  
reportedly the film was re-cut several times  
this is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing  
there's one good point where peel is running from one room to another in a house designed by escher  
other than that , the effects are second-rate  
the weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes  
thurman almost makes an adequate emma peel but it doesn't work  
she looks good , dresses in all the right fetish outfits but there's no spark  
fiennes fares even less well  
macnee's steed was a witty man of the world with a sense of humor  
fiennes' agent comes across as a dour kid in grown-up clothes who has never been out of his home town  
even connery , one of the greatest living actors , doesn't have much of a presence outside of a few fiery scenes  
the action scenes are difficult to follow  
director jeremiah chechik ( responsible for the atrocious remake of "" diabolique "" ) somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it shouldn't be  
things happen , people move around , but even if , with the utmost effort , you were able to care about any of it , the scenes are bewildering  
the primary allure of the original was the interaction between the two leads  
witty banter and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination  
admittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film , but there's no chemistry and the repartee is anything but clever  
one of emma peel's first lines of dialog is "" rules are made to be broken  "" 
it doesn't get any better  
advance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone  
the release date was changed several times  
connery refuses to promote the film  
there was no screening for critics which may have been a good choice for warner brothers  
at least this way , they get something of an audience for the first weekend before the news gets out  
admittedly i haven't seen an episode of the television series for a couple of decades  
my guess is that it would be severely dated now  
no matter how antiquated it might be , there's no doubt that it holds up better than this film is at first viewing "
-1,
-1,"and i thought "" stigmata "" would be the worst religiously-oriented thriller released this year  
turns out i was wrong , because while "" stigmata "" was merely boring and self-important , "" end of days "" is completely inept on all fronts  
it's a silly , incomprehensible , endlessly stupid mess  
for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best , it's extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up  
for the first time in recent memory , an arnold action movie ( and "" batman & robin "" doesn't count ) is no fun at all  
 "" end of days "" is a major stinker  
the movie opens in vatican city , 1979  
some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy , which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation  
if he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 , 1999 , the world will be destroyed  
the pope orders protection of this girl , though some priests believe she ought to be killed  
in new york , that very night , a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy  
twenty years later , we meet jericho cane ( schwarzenegger ) , a suicidal ex-cop with a drinking problem  
now working as a security guard for hire , he is protecting a local businessman ( gabriel byrne ) , who is actually possessed by the devil  
an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after , christine york ( robin tunney )  
recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine ( including ownership of the same music box , apparently ) , jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her  
there are so many problems with this film it's hard to know where to begin , but how about starting with the concept ? 
casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with  
schwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea  
arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions  
in other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake  
harrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they've all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger  
there are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho's character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine's location by offering him his old life back  
none of these scenes really work , because arnie isn't up to the task  
the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before  
this one isn't at all believable the way arnold plays him  
the supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all  
as the prince of darkness , he's suave and confident  
he acts like one would expect the devil to act  
the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain  
byrne out-performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil  
byrne's speech about the bible being "" overrated "" actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold's attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the "" 'tis not ! "" 
variety ) are feeble at best  
the only problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares  
kevin pollack plays jericho's security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after about an hour  
robin tunney isn't given much to do except look scared  
in fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , save for byrne , is given anything interesting to do  
performances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it  
this being an action blockbuster , it's no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script , which starts off totally confusing , and when some of it is explained ( and not much of it is ) , it's utterly ridiculous  
why is the devil coming on new year's eve , 1999 ? 
because it's exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which isn't 666 , it turns out  
some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the beginning , and you've got 1999 ! 
if you don't buy this explanation , you're not alone  
it's convoluted and silly at the same time  
the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous ( she's christine , see , and she lives in new york , see  
  
  ) , and if that weren't bad enough , there's plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn't explained at all  
why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street , but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex-cop , he's powerless ? 
is he impervious to only one kind of bullet ? 
how come he can't control jericho or christine ? 
and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies ? 
a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this , but it's never actually explained  
usually , this sort of thing wouldn't matter in a schwarzenegger flick ( i mean , don't get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies ) , but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting  
there are several predictable horror film clich ? s present in "" end of days , "" complete with the old "" black cat hiding in a cabinet "" bit , not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there  
it gets so formulaic that it's possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a "" boo "" will come  
their predictions will rarely be wrong  
the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless , partially because we don't care about these characters ( due to the script's pathetic attempts at characterization and setup ) , and also because they , too , don't make any sense  
there's a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady  
it's good for a few chuckles , but not much else  
supposedly we're to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan , but the script never sets that up , so the scene is merely silly  
none of this is terribly exciting , because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it's often hard to tell why it's happening in the first place , not to mention that they're edited in full-on incomprehensible mtv quick-cut style  
most of them had me scratching my head , rather than saying , "" wow , cool ! "" 
 "" end of days "" is not only silly and confusing , but it's also distinctly unpleasant to watch  
the devil apparently doesn't operate in the more subtle , i'll-convince-people-to-kill-each-other fashion outlined in the bible , but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight  
this doesn't only make him an awfully predictable sort , but it also means that not a single scene in "" end of days "" goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence , or the odd kinky sexual encounter ( yet another bit that had me scratching my head )  
if violence is supposed to be shocking , it's not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb  
scenes aren't connected through any reasonable means , so a lot of the time , stuff gets blown up , or people get killed , and i had no idea why  
reasons ? 
to hell with reasons ! 
let's just blow stuff up ! 
isn't it cool ? 
nope , not by a long shot  
this film is thoroughly unwatchable  
it's dull , interminable , and unrelenting in its stupidity  
perhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career , because it's not happening with hack peter hyams here  
 "" end of days "" might have had camp value , if only it didn't top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody's going to buy  
if the movie is going to be serious , the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script  
if it's going to be campy , arnold shouldn't be taking himself so damn seriously ( i didn't actually see him put up on a cross , did i ? ) , and his character shouldn't be such a sad sack "

-1,"the following review encompasses two versions of dune : 
dune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book  
the film's visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative  
dune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television  
it was disowned by director david lynch but it's considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline  
quality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web  
 * * * the review * * * 
released in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert's cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans  
director david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico  
the screenplay was lynch's own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected  
dune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors  
the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that's home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange  
the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe  
it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it  
most importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to "" fold space "" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish  
lynch's film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story's two main strands  
one is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis  
the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen  
the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom  
unfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended  
the thinking among universal's oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office  
with lynch's initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made  
what a great idea ! 
why not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ? 
the most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters  
thus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul's father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless  
the end result is a distinct chill : we can't warm to most of the cast and we don't care much for them  
and it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book  
dune is also a very serous film  
the constant "" self-talk "" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment  
the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them  
humour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen's mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find  
you may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus' star wars trilogy  
the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however  
it still possesses enough of lynch's stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi  
special effects whiz carlo rambaldi's giant sandworms are an awesome sight  
both the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original  
and the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years  
with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses  
see it in the widescreen format if you can  
and despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen  
sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who's secret aim is to manipulate paul's destiny for its own shadowy ends  
as paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade  
the conclusion ? 
any assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert's original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker  
david lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects  
dune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release  
many chose to stay away altogether , as the film's disastrous box office showing attests  
the extended version , however , is a rather different beast  
in 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition "" director's cut "" of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres  
but , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects  
in a way , then , it is partly lynch's own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa  
stung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director's guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with "" allen smithee "" , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work  
he also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous "" judas booth ""  
certainly , looking at the results of mca's handiwork there's at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object  
but these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas  
most of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version's storyline  
paul's relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously  
the political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained  
paul's initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably  
and as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe  
as a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv's version of dune is clearly superior  
as a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept  
the use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate  
there's some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order  
and the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg  
ships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out-of-context  
this is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so  
it should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u  s "

-1,"kate ( jennifer aniston ) is having some problems  
it appears the twenty-eight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder , and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired  
she learns that her problems are related , as the owner of her advertising agency , mr  mercer ( kevin dunn ) , explains to her that her single status does not bode well with the company  
her freedom would make her more likely to leave the company , taking clients with her  
a solution presents itself in nick ( jay mohr ) , a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coincidence and gets photographed with  
kate's boss , darcy ( illeana douglas ) , uses the photograph to fabricate a wedding engagement between kate and nick  
kate is at first repulsed by the idea , but after getting immediate positive results , she pursues it  
her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan  
the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc ?  
at a dinner with kate's bosses he will provoke a fight and they will break up  
she meets nick to propose the plan  
he accepts  
kate's new status brings unexpected results in other areas  
the office bad boy , sam ( kevin bacon ) , who wouldn't give kate the time of day , now does  
now that she is engaged , he pursues an affair with her , as doing so would destroy her good girl image , hence sam's sudden interest  
things start to fall apart for kate , as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her , and does not wish to break up with her  
after some provoking nick does oblige , but problems continue for kate  
it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available  
or maybe kate does like nick , but "" reconciliation "" will force her to admit her lies to her employer  
adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother ( olympia dukakis ) , who wants her to get married and settle down  
there is a scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is ( from the waist up ) only wearing a bra  
it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one  
there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer  
it's like the director said 'well , we know the story is formulaic and the performances aren't that great so , what the heck , let's show jennifer's assets as often and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating  "" 
quite frankly it's insulting  
i don't think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie  
she did a decent enough job in ed burns' "" she's the one "" because it was a smaller and supporting role , and she just doesn't deliver the goods effectively in this movie  
her performance was not convincing  
unfortunately , as far as romantic comedies go , this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies  
the film is similar to "" my best friends wedding "" in a sense that the leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her actions , gets no sympathy from me when things go awry  
i didn't care for how quickly kate puts down nick's profession by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn't glamorous enough for her co-workers  
at least "" my best friends wedding "" changed the formula a bit and had a somewhat surprise ending  
no such luck with "" picture perfect ""  
every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away , including a couple that really made no sense  
after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company , why would she blindly throw it all away when she should have made sure that nick would even talk to her first , let alone consider a relationship ? 
was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick ? 
throw in the fact that i don't think nick and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of a decision  
i believe that kate liked him , but liked him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away ? 
i doubt it  
and what of the ending scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the couple ? 
are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers ? 
well , i guess of the congregation consists of movie extras and the strangers are the movies two lead stars , then that would make sense  
picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron 
kate                         jennifer aniston nick   "

i * did * go into this one with high expectations  
i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks  
i sort of expected another exorcist or the shining  
i even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film  
boy , was i wrong ! 
another garbage slasher flick , the only difference being that * this * one has a story ! 
the story , you ask ? 
well , a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk  
he takes it home , somehow getting it past customs : - ) and starts fiddling with it in his attic  
lo and behold , after he takes it apart , three demons appear and start taking him apart , but with meat hooks  
when they're finished , his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling  
they botch up their cleanup job , however , and manage to leave his heart ( or some gland ; i didn't really recognize the organ ) under a floorboard  
the guy's brother and his brother's wife appear at the door soon after , and decide to move in  
they throw away scumball's belongings , and set up house  
turns out that wife is a bit of a nympho , and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage  
she starts having some wild hallucinations  
later , hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards ( slow-mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground--all from the tiny cut on his hand )  
said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumball's organ  
the organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing  
it establishes mind contact with wife , who agrees to help him get more blood , because she really wants to be screwed again  
so , she helps him kill three businessmen  
scumball , at this time , gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back  
problem is , he doesn't have any skin , and even after three or four corpses , still doesn't get any skin  
he finally gets some , though , but strangely enough , he ends up looking like his brother  
guess they couldn't get the original actor back  
who knows  
scumball ( whose name is frank ) is not a nice guy  
he describes his torture by the demons fondly , as the "" ultimate pleasure and pain , since at that level there is no difference between the two  "" 
somehow , i don't see getting torn apart by 90 fish- and meat-hooks a lot of fun  
this guy is * so * bad ( "" how bad * is * he ? "" ) , 
 * so * bad that the * rats * cower in a corner in fear  
for good reason , too ; he crucifies two of them for fun , and carves a third while the nympho's horsing around with hubby  
anyway  hubby's daughter ( who , if course , is not * wife's * daughter ) starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams  
the dumb bimbo meets scumball , and is not impressed  
she manages to escape with the chinese puzzle , and brings out the demons  
at any rate , the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup ; they're normally quite meticulous about that type of thing  
the story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake  
the demons are not , however , the good guys  
the dumb bimbo's the good guy  
she somehow not only gets them to take care of frank , but also banishes them to hell or oblivion , we're not too sure which  
not too shabby for someone with single-digit iq  
this is basically a "" bad jinn "" story  
it is an * awful * movie  
awful acting , bad focus in the photography , many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks , which is really unrealistic , and looks like the latex that it is  
continuity ? 
who cares  
acting ? 
 * terrible *  
script ? 
horrible  
sounds canned  
unrealistic  
story is so-so , but the impact is lost long , long before the film ends  
i do think the * rat * acting was quite good  
i have never seen rats look afraid  
they should get nominated for an award  
really good acting there , the best in the movie  
 "" the envelope for best furry rodent , please    "" 
a "" "" rating would be far too generous  
a "" 1/10 "" rating ( or -4 in the -4 to +4 rating system ) is far more accurate  
this movie is so bad that people in the audience were laughing , chortling at the bad acting and crummy dialog  
i can see this film turning into the next rocky horror picture show  
people were getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up to the characters on the screen  
had to have something to do  
dumb , dumb , dumb movie  
i was embarrassed that i spent money to see it  
it goes without saying that i disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself  
lots of slime and red-dyed corn syrup does not constitute "" horror , "" in my opinion "

-1,"capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence  
visually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver's travels and treat it as an action film  
that makes it a film without much center  
 , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 
pierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a  k  a  monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire  
it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver's travels  
humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift's island of the houyhnhnms  
the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet  
it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that  
when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish  
the final irony of the original version has become film history  
without it there could never have been a "" planet of the apes "" film series  
i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language  
in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language  
that could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking  
serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film  
justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending  
but serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear  
few viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history  
partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith's best if not his best  
when the film's success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s  
while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases  
the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973  
now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again  
for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton's new version is even less faithful  
first , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes  
he has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes  
that could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes  
as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring  
in 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world's most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes  
then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet  
 ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect  ) 
he quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks  
and the language they talk is earth- english  
apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that  
the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn't occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film  
both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english  
in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships  
outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic  
leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter  
ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power  
she is bent on making the world a better place  
perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari  
in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film  
she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward  
it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes  
this is a further abandonment of the source material  
the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each's place in this reversed society , each important in the book  
we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down  
we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them  
burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn  
this is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in  
they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win  
the 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like "" i never met an ape i didn't like , "" but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character  
most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals  
the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog  
this tends to limit close looks at the makeup  
in general it seems much improved from 1968  
the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version  
in 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper  
it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion  
chambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker  
today audiences have higher expectations ; baker's visualization is really an improvement "
