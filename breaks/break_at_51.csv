1,"i swear i have seen the edge before  
in fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film  
however , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot  
in doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker  
unfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film  
but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head  
one surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script  
action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence  
even horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all  
the river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s  
the intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day  
the edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall  
i must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes  
this is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world )  
if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely )  
the edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film  
but taking scream's lead , the edge makes fun of the genre's cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively )  
charles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him  
for once , we don't immediately care for the main character  
instead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness  
they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic  
charles' birthday is the same day , and he receives a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob  
as action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect  
soon , however , bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his "" personality  "" 
charles , bob , bob's assistant steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the previews , hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter  
down the plane goes , the pilot is killed , and the three are left to survive in the wilderness  
director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow , and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations  
he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film  
take , for instance , the entire man-hunting bear plot  
this has been done many times in films with different animals , and even bears  
but given the charles' intelligence , and bob's uncertainty , many of the cliches are given fresh twists  
even charles himself seems to have seen these action films before  
my favorite line of the film comes from charles : "" most people die in the wilderness because they didn't do the one thing that could save their life    
thinking  "" 
despite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything isn't as it seems anymore  
i have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise , so instead i will avoid it entirely  
the first two-thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along , and some of charles' survival techniques seem possible , even making fire from ice  
tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear , but whenever the bear is present , the characters lose all sensibility  
i have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water  
why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ? 
i guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while  
thankfully , we already have begun to care for the characters , and so we let this small detail slide  
but some of the technical details are awkward , such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make ( where did they get thread and needles ? )  
the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature , and borders on phenomenal  
anthony hopkins gives a terrific performance , creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day  
hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles , but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences' sympathy , something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs  
alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game )  
baldwin can be a good or a bad character , and here he succeeds at both in a way  
you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end , and baldwin is able to handle the double-natured photographer  
elle macpherson gives a good performance , albeit slight "

1,"many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come , the new film by visionary director vincent ward  
most will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors  
but little do they know ( as i so plainly found out ) that this has quite a complex story to tell  
walking out of the theater , i could see the audience's disgust    
one member even had to be awakened after the film ended  
don't believe the previews that you see    
this is definitely not a film for everyone  
this is quite possibly one of the most adult-oriented films to come out in recent years  
kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline  
the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us  
it goes back and forth in time , as if it has no boundaries  
think of the film city of angels  
now add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision  
both films deal with the afterlife , but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office  
costing around $85 million to make , the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it's money back  
but due to it's story , i doubt it will  
for everyone who thought titanic's story was too simple and cliche , here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay , it may not have done nearly as well  
but don't get me wrong    
i hope the film does do well  
it's a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen  
i doubt most of us could have thought of this place , even in our own mind  
what dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals  
the only film that surpasses it is dark city  
full of rich , shocking colors , we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to  
but don't do that , because you'll end up going to hell  
what dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake  
chris "" christy "" nielsen ( robin williams ) is startled by the sudden jolt , but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat  
annie ( annabella sciorra ) spies chris , as well , and both eventually bond and get married  
annie is an artist , whose paintings are colorful , lush , and surrealistic  
chris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself  
they also have two children , marie ( jessica brooks ) and ian ( josh paddock )  
but one day , the two children are killed in a car crash , and it almost destroys annie  
she tries to commit suicide , but fails , and is then put in an institution  
chris copes with the problem by realizing they aren't around anymore , and nothing will change that  
just as annie gets her life back in order , chris is killed while trying to save the life of a car crash victim  
chris goes to heaven , or his version of heaven , rather  
guided by albert ( cuba gooding , jr  ) , chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy  
that is , until he realizes how miserable he is without annie  
prior to heaven , he would try to comfort annie , but the more he was around , the more pain she felt  
chris decides to leave her alone  
little does he realize what will happen next  
i'm not about to say , because the plot point is crucial to the rest of the story ( many critics , however , give it away )  
certainly , chris dying is crucial to the plot , but they tell you that he dies in the previews  
story is not necessarily important for this movie to work , because it deals with the afterlife "

it is the pinnacle of a movie , a complete work , a flawless film

besides , there's too much to describe  
sure , it's about police and searching for corruption and who fights for the right reasons and the definition of justice

we'll do just about anything to put off a task  
when the deadline for this column nears , it's the only time during the week dishes get washed and the bed made and laundry done and plants watered and    
eventually , hopefully , sometimes , there's a breakthrough and we actually get down to work  
amazingly it's almost always easier than we dreaded and after finishing , that sense of oppressive apprehension melts away  
and then , the next time , we do it all again  
english professor grady tripp ( michael douglas ) is a master  
seven years ago , his first book was a hit  
he's been working on his second -- a short 200-page piece -- since then  
fearful that he can't live up to the first , he can't bring himself to finish it  
no writer's block , he's nearing 3 , 000 pages with no end in sight  
now he's having a particularly difficult day  
the college's annual writers conference is bringing in accomplished novelists reminding tripp that other people are finishing _their_ books  
during the first day , his wife has left him , his married girlfriend informs him she's pregnant and his agent is in town with a six-foot transvestite in tow  
by the evening , our besieged writer is driving though the snow-covered streets of pittsburgh with a suicidal student beside him , a stolen jacket that marilyn monroe wore on her wedding day in the back seat and a murdered blind dog stuffed in the trunk  
this could be a pivotal point in his mid-life crisis  
and then there's the next morning  
there's a lot to like about this movie  
there are no huge explosions , shattering glass or computer-generated dinosaurs to distract from the very real human issues  
grady is caught up in the curse of people who accomplish great things early in their career  
in the world of "" what have you done for me lately ? "" , he knows his second book has to be better than his first  
instead of finding out , he drifts , comfortable in the insular cocoon of academic peter panhood  
he doesn't have much of a life and neither does his star pupil james leer ( tobey maguire )  
james may be suicidal and psychotic  
certainly everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie  
he makes up a past of working clash anguish because the truth of wealth and comfort just isn't interesting enough  
as the weekend progresses , they are both forced to fully engage life  
that's the question they must face : comfort or real experiences ? 
the film takes some interesting chances  
non-traditional relationships are presented as matter-of-fact  
extra-marital , gay , interracial , professor-student : here they aren't judged , merely choices  
the actors are all first-rate  
douglas triumphs , playing against type as he spends most of his time disheveled , unshaven and clad in a pink women's house robe  
maguire's disengaged alienation works perfectly here  
robert downey jr  as grady's agent livens up his scenes  
director curtis hanson ( "" l  a  
confidential "" ) makes a few missteps  
the women are underused  
frances mcdormand does a good job of her limited role of sara , grady's married lover but we never understand much of who she is  
the chemistry between the two of them is non-existent which makes some of the ending unconvincing  
katie holmes is a student with a major crush on the professor , but her character goes nowhere  
we never even see grady's exiting wife  
this is very much a guy's film  
the varied relationships between the men are much more convincing than any of the others  
grady's alternating mentoring and rejection of james is the centerpoint of the film , not him and sara  
as the boomers age , expect to see more mid-life crisis films to catch the attention of that demographic  
eventually it'll probably become cliche , but right now we've got a winner

1,"ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan ? 
you remember , he was the title character in that 70's sitcom , "" welcome back kotter  "" 
always trying to help out the sweathogs , frequently trying to dodge mr  woodman , ever wary of his wife's tuna casserole  
 "" so , "" you ask , "" where is he now ? "" 
mr  kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high-stakes poker  
that's right  
i'm not sure if it's his main source of income , but from what i've heard , the guy occasionally comes away with $20 , 000 at a time  
and there you were , thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off-broadway theater  
you silly goose  
well , gabe kaplan isn't in the movie rounders , nor is the film about the actor come gambler's life  
but rounders is about poker , and gabe plays poker , and i thought that was kind of a neat connection  
sorry about the segue , or lack thereof  
matt damon plays mike mcdermott , a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker  
he's been playing for a while , and more than being proficient , he has caught the bug  
he goes to all the underground games in new york city , knows the regulars , and knows how to win  
in the beginning of the film , he's built up a nice thirty grand nest egg , which he takes to the speakeasy-type gaming parlor where the big boys play  
mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb ( john malkovich ) , an oreo-munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia  
mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker , but instead he loses it all in a single hand  
months later , he's paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck  
when mike's best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students , he wants to pick up right were they left off , working as a team to part others with their betting cash  
although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student , jo ( gretchen mol ) , worm connives mike into playing once more , and mike , bitten again by the bug , slides down that slippery slope , risking his relationship , education , and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life  
to make a film about gambling , a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters  
this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth  
rounders , however , seems to go more for the latter than the former  
the card clubs mike and worm frequent aren't very glamorous at all  
there's a basement , a lodge with elk heads on the wall , a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots  
except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table  
the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it  
we're given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them  
matt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker  
ed norton's worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they're worth  
john turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments  
he's both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro's low-key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich's heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself  
martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike's law professors , abe petrovsky  
while landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one's self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending  
perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just didn't seem to have much presence on screen  
she's a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn't be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon's reactions instead  
a good thing about rounders is that it doesn't get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can't find time for humor  
the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales  
one game in a cigar club had me in stitches  
 "" i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper , "" says one of the players , clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other  
i was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys  
with all the poker being played , rounders had the potential to be very confusing  
you might think you know a lot about poker , but think again  
luckily , we're given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what's going on  
the narrations are more informative than intrusive , and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do  
it's nice that as the characters develop , so does our comprehension of their world  
as a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker , rounders delivers in spades  
wait ! 
as a film about the culture of cards , rounders is an ace  
hang on ! 
packed with great acting and great characters , rounders is a full house  
okay , i guess that's enough "

1,"on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with  
in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his "" giallo "" murder mysteries  
while it's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller  
the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book "" tenebrae ""  
with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems  
the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa  
he brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him  
the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension  
argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business  
tenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here  
it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play  
in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes  
needless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist  
many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork  
they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria  
instead , tenebrae's set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world  
and the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment  
so tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question  
still , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative  
some critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated  
by the way , if you don't want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs  
about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious  
we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal  
he is insane , apparently  
the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife  
he is finally revealed to us as this "" second killer "" in the film's bloody climax  
but argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively  
you see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house  
but thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway  
bad cutting puts the timing way out  
in other words , he's almost in two places at once  
during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring  
by the film's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant  
the injury ? 
he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! 
thus , the revelation of the "" hero "" as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled  
helpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along  
but there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least  
the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa's mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage  
tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies  
for instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike  
we would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren't even introduced too ! 
that's careless filmmaking , pure and simple  
why , you may ask , do i go on about the story's flaws ? 
because when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world  
take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae  
an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town  
finally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer's lair  
it's an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone  
and that's exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating  
too often , it seems , argento's films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts  
mind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look  
and if you're a fan of argento's unique style of giallo thriller then it's essential  
see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli  
it's a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative "

1,"jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation  
even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited , the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation  
this is , after all , the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction  
to say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood , since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio , desperado , four rooms , and from dusk 'til dawn  
he was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide  
 ( i'm willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him  ) 
tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films , but never took the director's helm  
nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more , tarantino returns with a film he can call his own  
the film opens up with an homage to the graduate , with jackie brown ( pam grier ) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her  
jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo , which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas  
this makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi ( samuel l  jackson ) who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico  
however , while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u  s  for ordell , jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus ( michael bowen ) and atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , who catch her not only with the money , but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs  
jackie didn't know they were in the package with the cash , but that's of no consequence to the authorities , who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted  
of course , dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish , ordell  
ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) to get jackie out of jail , but while max is immediately attracted to her , jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety , since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police  
sure enough , ordell shows up at jackie's apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good , but she "" borrows "" max's pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell  
instead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol's chamber to ordell's head , jackie proposes a deal  
since ordell wants to get his money out of mexico , jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more , but this time for a more substantial fee : fifteen percent of ordell's half million dollars  
with a gun in his face , how can ordell not agree ? 
by itself , this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film  
however , we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think  
jackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell , but she's also making a deal with the feds as well as with max  
the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham , but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around  
instead , it's actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today's movies  
at least this film has a little imagination  
most of the performances in jackie brown are above par  
pam grier , of whom i had never taken notice before , plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable  
samuel l  jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control  
robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy , trying to do his best   
never mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy's apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course  
he's just so down-to-earth , the nature of his job really doesn't occur to us , even when we're shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison , or when we see the tools of his trade  
in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara , a recently paroled friend of ordell's , and bridget fonda as melanie , one of the girls ordell keeps around town  
unfortunately , de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between , and then they are mostly clipped sentences  
in this film , he's not really de niro , but stereotypical de niro , uttering things like , "" little bit , "" and "" pretty much  "" 
fonda , on the other hand , plays the slightly spaced-out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness , such that even when she is annoying louis , we are taking her side  
as is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand , the dialog is quick and snappy  
it grabs our attention and is actually interesting , and in many respects , this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals ; the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves  
don't count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera , however  
there's a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange , and he's not really sure what's happening , but by composing the scene just so , his realization of what's going on is felt simultaneously by the audience  
we look at the screen and think , "" gee , that's clever , "" and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on  
although tarantino isn't afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect , it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film  
there are shots where a character is simply driving , and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head  
this is a tribute to both direction and acting  
however , there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall , and she is looking for something ; desperately looking for something  
we get the idea of the frantic nature of her search , but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she's looking for , but instead hoping she'll just stop  
overall , viewing jackie brown is time spent well  
some flap has already been made about the language used in the film , but it's really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today "

1,"melvin van peebles' "" sweet sweetback's baadasssss song "" was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement  
it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident  
its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before  
in style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , "" sweet sweetback "" was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter  
van peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built "" sweet sweetback "" from the ground up almost entirely by himself  
because no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself  
the movie ended up costing about $500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby  
van peebles cut costs by hiring non-union labor and taking on most of the film's responsibilities himself  
he wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role  
he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck  
for instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases "" rated x by an all-white jury , "" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film  
he also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling  
the storyline in "" sweet sweetback "" is deceptively simple  
it takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex  
one day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they're bringing in suspects on a politically-charged case involving murder  
however , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu-mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously  
acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death  
the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico  
although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles' camera to roam the darker side of l  a  - the ghettos , alleys , and back-street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked  
van peebles' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored  
at the beginning of "" sweet sweetback , "" he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : "" sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality    "" 
van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration  
of course , with today's abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , "" sweet sweetback "" doesn't seem all that revolutionary  
it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made  
at that time , "" sweet sweetback "" was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it  
distributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles' words , gave the black audience "" a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass  "" 
of course , once it caught on , it caught on big  
 "" sweet sweetback "" is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates "" sweetback "" from other movies like "" shaft "" ( 1972 ) and "" the mack "" ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios  
 "" sweet sweetback "" is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers  
however , even if when viewed from an african-american perspective , "" sweet sweetback "" is certainly not without its controversies  
when it was first released , an article was published in "" ebony "" magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it  
there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of  
others have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives  
still others point to the clich ? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm  
nevertheless , a movie like "" sweet sweetback "" cannot be made without conflicting points of view  
it is a revolutionary movie not because it's about one man's defiance , but because it put front-and-center black issues that had never been dealt with before  
until that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites  
the fact that "" sweet sweetback "" was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply "" the black community "" )  
van peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between "" sweet sweetback "" and all movies that had come before it  
when the movie first opened , he saw it in a theater next to an older woman  
near the end of the film , when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert , she kept saying to herself , "" oh lord , let him die  
don't let them kill him  
let him die on his own  "" 
it was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african-american in a movie who rebelled against white authority , that she couldn't even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape  
and , of course , sweetback does escape , and the screen fills with the message : "" watch out ! 
a baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues  "" 
beyond the political aspects , "" sweet sweetback "" is an entertaining picture , which van peebles always intended it to be  
he squeezed every drop out of his limited budget , and produced a film that , although dated now , was technically fantastic at the time "

1,"ladies and gentlemen , 1997's independence day is here ! 
it's title : starship troopers  
and surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4  
i realize that i gave last year's sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour  
after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn't as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review  
starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem  
as a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film  
in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film  
starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether  
while starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : "" the 'star wars' of the 90s  "" 
am i being to generous to this film ? 
perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races  
in essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction  
the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to  
starship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a "" kick-the-aliens'-asses "" style  
id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role  
this new "" star wars "" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs  an alien species  
the alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects  
however , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy  
sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization  
more than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends  
and they should be  
i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film  
this is an "" event "" film , but surprisingly above average  
it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved )  
starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange "" join the army "" ads  
mixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original  
stating , "" would you like to know more ? "" , 
these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously  
however , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way  
after witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw  
we are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards )  
rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms  
however , carmen isn't as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot  
however , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico  
unfortunately , rico isn't interested in dizzy  
this setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch  
carmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up  
and as a result , dizzy signs up  
everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry  
the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships  
in reality , i found myself watching a space version of "" melrose place , "" but with better special effects  
an hour into the film , the war begins  
a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with  
the first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must )  
following the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war  
the bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else  
many dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs' attacks  
a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense  
the troopers are ordered to locate the "" brain "" and capture it  
i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot  
it's about special effects and gory violence  
director verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall "

1,"oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with ! 
in a perfect world , "" a civil action "" would be a breath of fresh air  
it's cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isn't  
it's romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham book/film isn't  
and , the capper , it has no distinct ending , and the law in hollywood films is that above all else , you must have an ending  
even if it's based on a true story , a true story which hasn't yet ended , you must supply an ending , a false one , but an ending nevertheless  
hell , "" a civil action "" is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together ( and that includes "" the firm , "" the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic )  
yet it's also oddly and slightly unsatisfying  
weird  
this is , in fact , a steve zallian film , not just the work of a hack , and zallian is the director of the much-admired "" search for bobby fischer "" ( didn't see it ) and writer of none other than "" schindler's list  "" 
in short , i like this guy , and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories  
after all , apart from the obvious it's-a-holocaust-film and it's-a-spielberg-film , isn't "" schindler's list "" just a damn brilliant film , not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study  
 "" a civil action "" is the same way : it's narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study  
and it's here that the film seems to go a bit wrong  
the main complaint of this film is that while , yes , it's an engrossing lawyerly tale , it has no real ending , and that's not necessarily the problem with the film  
it's that it's just kind of unsatisfying  
if this were a great film , it would feel complete , and still end basically the same way  
but this film just seems to end , and i don't want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on : imagine , if you will , being one of those the film is about , looking forward to this film , and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter , just so the many won't bitch about what is , essentially , genuine  
but the fact that it just ends is not , in all actuality , what is wrong with it  
it's rather that zallian has chosen , in the last half hour , to adandon the traditional lawyer story , and chose the other part of his story , the one about the lawyer , one jan schlictman ( john travolta ) , who's shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer , brilliant because he's manipulative and he always wins  
it wishes to make it all about jan in the end , but the truth is , his change , although nicely done , is not full  
we see him suffering from a personal crisis , and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart , but in the end , we don't fully believe it  
and i think that the problem is when he has made his decision , the film choses an odd angle to go at , a noble one , but one that gives the film's conclusion that of incompleteness  
in the opening of the film , we see him doing his old schtick , manipulating courts , winning cases effortlessly , and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases  
in short , he's full of bullshit and we know it  
in the film , he takes a case that is hardly desired : a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river  
point one , it's not of the usual criteria ( jan points out , wickedly , that dead or wounded children aren't nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success )  
point two , it has been through several lawyers  
after turning them down , jan changes his mind ( a muddled scene - he stops his car on a bridge , looks out    is he feeling a sense of overachievement ? ) , and he and his team of lawyers ( tony shalhoub , zeljko ivanek , and accountant william h  macy ) head out to the town to do battle with the town's company  
they spend millions of dollars examining the land , test the water , what have you ( this is where stephen fry , a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in "" wilde , "" pops up thanklessly ) , and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children , and then , unsuccessfully , the workers at the plant  
they also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company , the eccentric jerome facher , played by robert duvall ( more on him later on )  
as we progress , we get so involved in the way the story is being told , which is engulfing everything around it , including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople ( one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland , who lost her child , who begins to have a personal crisis )  
things begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half , as they are up against impossible odds : the judge ( john lithgow ) is not only a strickler , but a pal of facher ; the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify ; no concrete evidence is being found , depsite the money spent to find it ; and they are quickly running out of money  
as macy mortgages everything he can , including their homes and their office , he slowly loses his sanity ( his meatiest role since , oh , "" fargo "" ) , and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist  
in fact , the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par ( owen gleiberman , especially , criticized the film for not being overly-dramatic    i 
suppose like a grisham novel )  
this wouldn't be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is : instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good , he's seen as being still full of bullshit  
because he doesn't take stock in the cares of his partners , and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town , he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out  
the final half tries to redeem this , as must have been the point of making this in zallian's mind , but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs , and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when he's seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him ( and thusly receiving two speeding tickets ) , we still feel that the big change in his life is that he's not rich and esteemed anymore ( the film's final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow )  
the fault is not that there is no closure to the court case ( it's still going on , you know ) , but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has  
we need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life , and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life  
it only feels like half of that  
maybe even less  
and it's not travolta , who does a great job here ( though never to be a truly memorable performance of his ) , but rather zallian , whose final chapter needs a rewrite  
up to then , though , it's an engrossing drama , one of the best of the year in fact , and one of the best lawyer films , period  
the reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted , but rather it's about the lawyers , the knights who battle eachother "

1,"vampire films , as well as other horror films , are usually dumb and predictable b-movies , meant to scare us by cliches and simple shocks  
it is therefore interesting to watch neil jordans recent film that is not only visually stunning , but has also a plot worth making movies about  
based on anne rice's novel , "" interview with a vampire "" is a long , dark trip to hell  
the film opens with gothic quire and dark streets of present-day san francisco  
the camera slowly find particular window  
a shape of a young man is visible in the darkness  
 "" so you want me to tell you the story of my life ? ""  
the mysterious man is louis ( brad pitt ) , a two-century old vampire , telling his story to a fascinated interviewer ( christian slater )  
his tale opens in 1791 louisiana , just south of new orleans , where louis falls victim to the vampire lestat ( tom cruise )  
given a choice between death and eternal life as one of the undead , louis chooses the latter , a decision he will forever regret  
everlasting life and eternal youth , promised to him by lestat , turn instead into never ending suffering , damned to eternal hunger for blood and longing for peace  
louis cannot kill with the impunity of lestat , but , to sate his hunger , he must feed , and the blood of animals is not enough  
eventually , he pierces the neck of a grief-stricken young girl named claudia ( kirsten dunst ) , whom lestat then curses with his unholy form of resurrection so that she can be a surrogate daughter to both himself and louis  
for a while , they are one "" big , happy family  "" 
but all things end , and claudia's growing resentment of lestat fuels a bloody confrontation  
when luis and claudia break loose from lestat , they travel to paris , where the euro-vamps santiago ( stephen rea ) and armand ( antonio banderas ) , who introduced them to a bigger world of the damned  
director neil jordan ( "" the crying game "" ) together with the talented director of cinematography philippe rousselot and composer elliot goldenthal has created an incredible atmosphere  
as the film begins , there is an incredible palette of colors , beautiful sunrises , lush golden fields , green forests , inky-blue clouds and blending sun  
when luis is "" born to darkness "" , everything suddenly changes to dark velvet , lit only by the silver moonlight  
the beautiful production design by dante ferretti , wonderful costumes and art direction by malcolm middleton re-create the multiple historical periods in the film  
from the renaissance new orleans and the beautiful rococo paris of the 18th century , to our present days  
the casting is likewise good , involving some of the most famous and beautiful stars of hollywood , ireland and spain  
the controversial casting of tom cruise as lestat is incredibly effective  
cruise is energetic , sinister , charismatic , wild and bloodthirsty  
cruise's lestat likes to seduce young women before exacting his dark red sustenance  
with alarming swiftness , the victims switch from sexual excitement to outright horror , as his murderous purpose becomes clear  
 ""    kill them mercifully , but do it  
you are what you are   for 
do not doubt , you are a killer ! "" 
that is how lestat is teaching luis  
but behind that furious facade is anger and loneliness that he carries through the centuries and tries to smother with nightly rampages  
brad pitt is equally convincing as the "" vampire with a human soul ""  
antonio banderas and stephen rea are effective , but since they play more or less secondary characters , their performances are almost invisible  
the greatest performance in the film comes suprisingly from the young kristen dunst , who manages to create an incredibly emotional and believable character  
the world is changing around the little child , but she does not  
she remains unchangeable - a child for all eternity  
only her wise , dark eyes reveal her age  
ironically the film's only miss is the script  
anne rice's novel is a very interesting read , and her script is rich , colorful and emotional , but it is also tiering and too melancholic , at times resembling a soap opera : 
claudia : ""     is that what i should do ? 
let you go   my 
father , my luis , who made me    who will look after me , my dark angel , when you are gone ? "" 
luis : "" everything will be alright "
1,"seen july 8 , 1998 at the crossgates cinema 18 , ( albany , ny ) , theater #7 , at 8 : 15 p  m  with my mom using hoyts cinema cash  
[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats] 
it's very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic , vivid sense of reality and life  
all stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters' lives , but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do  
therefore , "" gone with the wind "" deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does , in such a crafted , intricate , and entertaining manner  
it's a crowning achievement , not only in filmmaking , but for storytelling itself  
the film takes place in georgia before , during , and after the civil war  
this plays a major factor in the film's success  
to use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy  
it might also seem cliche , boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers  
can a story set so long ago be relatable now ? 
the film confronts all these problems , paradoxically , by not cronfronting them  
it doesn't simply plug in the "" right thing "" at the "" right time , "" it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant  
building a strong foundation is important to all forms of media , without which , what is there to build on ? 
we're given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters , especially our main character , scarlett o'hara ( leigh ) , a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel , a cunning wit , and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time  
she knows how her society works , wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her  
right from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be  
being the most sought-after woman allows her to manipulate men ( and their women ) to ensure she gets her way , whether it be obvious ( i  e  
who will be the one to get her food ) , or subtle ( i  e  
getting married just to spite someone )  
the man she claims to love is ashley wilkes ( howard ) , a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him  
he isn't so arrogant and demanding as scarlett , in fact , he's engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his  
her name is melanie ( de havilland ) , and she is one of the sweetest , kindest , and most likable characters one will ever see  
she and scarlett become very dear friends , but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her , and the love she has for her husband  
her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic - it defines who she is , but doesn't give her much emotional self-defense  
acting a catalyst to the love triangle , and to the story as a whole is the daper , stong-willed , cunning , cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler ( gable )  
he's quite a character all right - everyone listens to what he has to say even though he's got a bad reputation  
butler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior  
he tells everyone the much-needed truth in the rigid caste-like society where freewill doesn't seem to exist , everything is done out of honor and tradition  
for example , in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there's no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out  
this angers them , not for his lack of faith , but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that  
 "" do we have ammunition factories ? 
do we have food ? 
do we have a navy ? 
all we have is tobacco  "" 
all true statements and yet the south still insists he's wrong  
butler is a shifty character to be sure , but he takes such pride in his arrogance it's appealing  
scarlett notices this too when she first sees him , and from the look butler gives her , we know he's not going to stop until he has her  
but scarlett can't get past her need for ashley , and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story , butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever  
and so the story goes on , with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life  
the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband , especially after she is "" marked "" for life when her first husband dies  
this gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story  
some are vital for only a few scenes , but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film  
in most films only a few characters exist for support in background , but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance  
even people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set  
the costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place  
the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside , real world , but these types of simple approaches are never taken  
the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war  
fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is  
one scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming , "" no ! 
not my leg ! 
don't cut off my leg ! "" 
another scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street , but as the camera pulls back , we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers , but it is their moaning that's more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be  
as the second half begins , the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single-handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north  
she manages to resurrect the family plantation , but all the willpower she has can't help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south's ultimate defeat  
this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love- hate relationship "

1,"many people dislike french films for their lack of closure  
while possibly shallow , i've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view  
there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil )  
stephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker  
he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing  
even the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches  
in the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man  
camille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes  
maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife  
like stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges  
when stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals  
however , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him  
stephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present  
as the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another  
these two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently  
stephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship  
however , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation  
the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher  
however , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing  
consequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays  
in contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier  
however , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world's finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing  
during the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions  
stephane attempts to remain unchanged  
however , we do see subtle hints of his transformation  
one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash  
the development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible  
american movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development  
in its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane  
the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille's and stepahne's characters  
i am not sure why berardinelli says , "" at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil's credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty  "" 
this movie is not about judging stephane's actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are  
i find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling  
this portion of the film is where the "" sense of closure "" could have been successfully accomplished  
unfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters  
while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film  
the synergism of the tension of ravel's music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen  
the directing in this movie is wonderful  
the actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth  
emmanuelle beart's personality is beautiful  
and needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful  
besides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral  
i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of  
the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ? 
i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing  
in summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship  
in the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people  
in itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie  
where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people  
i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture  
however , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film  
i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it "
1,"here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop  
okay , it isn't quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart  
most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them  
however , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered  
a lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash  
but , the thing is , it isn't  
it's well made , well acted , and quite intelligent  
i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film  
but the species series isn't about the lack of these elements  
it's about how much it can get into one film  
and yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so  
species ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe  
many films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film's needs  
species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars  
aboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut  
patrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed  
well , it would seem that he has succeeded  
landing on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so  
of course , he isn't the first ever  
about a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life  
now , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky  
no life lives on it  
that is , no visible life  
patrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground  
he takes them aboard , and puts them in storage  
unfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship  
just prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings  
they pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can't even remember  
they blame it on a technical malfunction  
back on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible  
as we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet  
however , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is  
patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge )  
eve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien  
however , this time around , most of her "" alien "" urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant  
the project is led by dr  laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable  
since she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again  
and it has  
story-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can't tell me it was strong on story )  
what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay  
in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles  
this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it )  
the script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot  
beginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie  
and it does it quite well  
the characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do  
the only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does  
there are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects  
the special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad  
but for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) "

1,"originally entitled dancing about architecture ( i  e  
 "" talking about love is like dancing about architecture "" ) , but changed because it sounded too much like the recent box-office dud dancing at lughnasa , this film slaps together a stunning cast of hollywood names , playing interesting and well-written characters , within a vignettes-styled plot arrangement a la robert altman  
plot : follow the lives of several couples falling in and out of love , finding themselves , regaining a clearer understanding of the people that they are , and who they want , and appreciating the fine emotional art of love  
critique : charmingly effective romantic drama , this film offers insight into various types of relationships , presents us with interesting characters and excellent performances from the cast , and scratches beneath the surface of love and its many complex subtleties  
how do people fall in love ? 
why do people fall out of love ? 
how do people fall back into love , once they've been hurt and left to join the lonely hearts club ? 
all of these questions and more , are touched upon in this film , within several types of variant relationships  
meet a hip , young couple going through their first date  
a divorcee attempting to date again after her many failed relationships  
a married woman "" finding herself "" while cheating on her husband  
a husband letting go of his inhibitions  
an older couple dealing with a past "" love "" of the man , a secret recently uncovered  
a son dying from aids , joined by his mother at the hospital  
there are many nuances to this picture , and many ideas and quotes to which we could all relate , but more importantly , there is diversity  
diversity of relationships helped me and my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels  
some related to the younger couples' issues  
others with the married  
there's a little bit of everything for everyone in here  
and i would bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch this film again in a year , i would relate myself to yet another predicament  
just like love itself , this movie is distinct and appreciated by all on many different levels  
the actors in this film are all also very , very good  
sean connery is solid as the older man with some issues to resolve , as is gena rowlands , as the aging wife with trepidations  
jolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance , while philippe is as pretty-boy as ever  
anderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to re-ignite her love life , opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by former talk-show host , jon stewart  
even dennis quaid manages to step outside of his overacting shoes in this film , and offers a convincing show of a man lost within his own imagination  
the only piece of this puzzle which left me somewhat detached , was the part surrounding jay mohr , the man dying from aids , and his mother , ellen burstyn  
the actors were fine , but somehow , the piece seemed out of place within the realm of everything else  
the ending of this film was also a little too saccharine for me , but i guess that's just hollywood  
this film is actually a lot like your friends and neigbors ( 5  5/10 ) and happiness ( 4  5/10 ) in concept and style , but its complete anthesis in regards to character relatibility and likeness  
the characters in those films were too unique and inhuman for anyone to care , as opposed to this film , which offers rich and believable characters , living real lives and talking about real issues in today's relationships  
all in all , this movie offers many interesting characters , talking and living genuine and engaging love lives , wonderful performances by its solid cast , too sweet of an ending , but an enjoyable and rewatchable movie nonetheless  
little known facts about this film and its stars : according to a story in the london sunday mirror , sean connery asked for only $60 , 000 for his role in this movie , as compared to his usual fee of $14 million , because he liked the script so much  
on top of that , he convinced his co-stars ( including gena rowlands , gillian anderson , ellen burstyn , et al  ) to do the same

1,"capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg  
joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs  
it lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure  
the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious  
i had a good time  
 , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
here goes my credibility  
this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority  
i liked the third jurassic park film  
i even liked the second jurassic park film  
in a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton's novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle's novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle  
jp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , "" for the boy who's half man or the man who's half boy  "" 
that is what all the jurassic park films are  
expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house  
the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon's mines had under-written characters also  
jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs  
the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting  
some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds  
that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require  
i feel i got my money's worth  
the story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica  
this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park  
they hope , no doubt , to get a look at the island's dinosaurs from a safe height  
the height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not  
the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended  
flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide  
he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs  
but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go  
doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h  macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs  
they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn  
he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once  
right  
guess what happens next ? 
jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2  
first it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm  
sattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first  
curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance  
one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time  
they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films  
of course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species  
not only are they more intelligent than in the past films , they are also more sympathetic  
in this story they are not just killing machines , they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition  
this time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized  
each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs , of course  
in this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus , not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus , but larger and presumably more nasty  
it has a crocodile's head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright  
perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs  
sometimes they just move too fast to see  
occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision  
a few times we get unconvincing matte shot , particularly of the laboratory  
but there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films  
the musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams's score for the first film "

1,"some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese's raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the '80s  
since there are still a number of '80s films that i haven't seen , i don't feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i'll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level  
bio-pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry , dull textbook account  
it's rare that a movie with the moniker "" based on the life of ? "" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining  
raging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre  
the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the '40s and '50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen  
for all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying  
historically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion's share of the details culled from la motta's own autobiography ( which was co-written with joseph carter and peter savage )  
however , although la motta is credited as the movie's "" consultant , "" he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout  
the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ? paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage  
sex and violence are inextricably linked  
the title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull  
in the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them  
outside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled  
the two people who spar with him on life's canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother/manager , joey ( joe pesci )  
these are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses  
he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence  
raging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up-and-coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class  
over the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch-rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match  
meanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15-year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife  
vicki becomes jake's greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain  
his own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him  
hence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ? perhaps even his brother  
 ( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : "" are you f * * king my wife ? ? ? "" ) 
in the late '40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall  
he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing  
two years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray  
by the late '50s and early '60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ? a broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine  
raging bull is the other side of rocky  
sylvester stallone's tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976  
it won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production  
but , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring  
while scorsese's primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man , he never backs away from showing the seedy , ugly underside of a sport where gambling , greed , and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working  
rocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased  
there's little i can say here that hasn't already said about de niro's performance  
in a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding  
the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering  
and , although there's a lot of travis bickle ( de niro's character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him  
this is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting  
as the younger jake , de niro is trim and fit  
as the fat , older man , de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form  
how many actors would go that far ? 
the best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance  
cathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work ( although neither won )  
their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro's  
pesci , who has basically re-created the same personality in two other scorsese films ( goodfellas and casino ) , presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother  
the misogyny and violence are still there , only better concealed  
but , when joey snaps , as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster ( frank vincent ) , it's startling to behold  
moriarty , on the other hand , must play the temptress with virginal qualities ? the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake  
later , she's called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear  
scorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black-and-white ( a few "" home movie "" segments are in color )  
the choice is perfect for the movie , giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black-and-white approach is almost unheard of  
 ( one important recent exception , schindler's list , eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did "

1,"most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts  
my family , for the most part , hates him and his movies  
i think he's very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years  
so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of  
unrestrained by physical boundaries , allen's humor comes shining through  
those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen's intelligent observations of life  
those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one  
in 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they'd never seen before  
toy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present  
many critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture  
antz , however , has upped the ante considerably  
disney's a bug's life isn't due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal  
by beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience's thirst for computer-animated films  
but don't let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared  
in the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios  
in 1997 , it was the volcano duel  
in my opinion , dante's peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality  
volcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations  
in 1998 , there are twice as many competing films  
first was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it's cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact  
but now , it's even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks )  
who will prevail ? 
time will tell , but i'm sure that mr  mouse has nothing to fear  
this may sound like i didn't like antz ; on the contrary , i'd put it up there with toy story  
but due to it's pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn't appear in disney's version  
some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film  
sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd  
the humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended  
this is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents  
antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen's shtick and franz kafka's metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug  
z ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker  
 "" when you're the middle child in a family of five million    "" he comments about his neglected childhood  
one night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life  
in walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown  
bala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader  
after discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there's a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony  
in order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants  
but to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her  
he and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed  
the queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony  
meanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him  
so z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites  
the battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence  
however , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence  
the second half of the film revolves around z's kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia  
there , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants  
the adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass  
looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i'm just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally ) "

1,"making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed , especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece  
when it comes to living up to expectations , a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure  
for a sequel to live up to or even surpass the original's greatness is very rare indeed  
and whereas "" babe : pig in the city "" misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe , it is a worthy companion piece  
more than that , it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like "" the godfather : part ii "" and "" the empire strikes back "" as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" picks up precisely where "" babe "" left off  
having won the sheep herding competition , farmer hoggett ( james cromwell ) and his pig are elevated to fame status  
a series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs  hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city  
in doing so , the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" flourishes where so many sequels fail  
most sequels simply rehash the events of the first film  
not "" babe : pig in the city ""  
this is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first  
also , by not being content to utilize most of the old characters , this film gives us many new ones to enjoy  
in essence , it doesn't attempt to copy itself  
instead , it strives to achieve an originality of its own  
and it succeeds  
that's not to say the familiar is absent  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film  
along with babe himself , ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride , as does mrs  hoggett ( one of this decade's best and most underappreciated comic characterizations , hilariously performed by magda szubanski )  
the three singing mice also make the journey , chiming in with their cute high-pitched vocals  
the story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice  
from there , we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne's soothingly deep narrative  
composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these  
but these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting  
while staying at the flealands hotel , babe encounters a veritable ark-full of new animals  
monkeys , kittens , and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new "" urbanites "" that babe befriends , as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter  
each character is distinctly unique , some of which are imbued with personal human-like struggles that are endearing and touching  
and while this world focuses largely on these animals , we are introduced to two new human characters as well  
mary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel , an animal-loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors  
stein's landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature  
we also meet fugly floom , an old soft-spoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel , utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions  
not having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film , it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was  
so as not to ruin this well-kept secret , i won't reveal the actor's identity here  
it was a treat indeed to see one of cinema's legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance  
the greatest triumph of "" babe : pig in the city "" is the art direction  
simply put--it bleeds creativity , taking the look of the original film to a whole new level  
restricted primarily to a farm the first time around , this second installment creates an entire city , dazzling us with unique fable-like architecture  
but the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world's architectural landmarks  
designing a skyline that includes the statue of liberty , the sydney opera house , the brooklyn bridge , the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower , ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities ( as seen in the film photo and pre-production drawing to your right )  
added to that , many of this city's streets are the twin siblings of venice's gondola-trekked rivers  
the metropolis that has sprung from ford's vision is a wondrous sight to behold  
it is a world that you want to walk around in  
norma moriceau's costume designs belong in this world , vibrant in color and style equal to that of the ford's landscape  
most of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish , with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly floom's clown outfit  
andrew lesnie's photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the film's multiple emotional tones  
much press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of "" babe : pig in the city ""  
reports stated that its original cut was branded with a pg-13 rating "

1,"review : ghost dog : the way of the samurai ( 1999 ) 
cast : forest whitaker , henry silva , cliff gorman , john tormey , gene riffini , victor argo , tricia vessey , isaach de bankole' , camille winbush director : jim jarmusch writer : jim jarmusch 
rating : good shot ( stars ) 
languid , yet pointed and focused , ghost dog : the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek , ultra-cool , cinematic image of the hitman  
juxtaposing the samurai's honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the american/italian mafia , it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptor's precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber , dinosaur-like , to function in the modern era  
director jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast , ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit  
using a palate of bleached colors , jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film  
he doesn't cater to audience expectations of hyper-colorized , stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies  
the action is presented in flat , brutal codas  
bullets have permanence  
death has consequences  
the movie rises beyond standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty  
it is an anti-movie , of sorts  
there are few photogenic , empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with  
this isn't a film that lovingly holds your hand  
there are dark , contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder , just so , asserting itself for all to see  
the fulcrum for the movie's thematic balancing act is ghost dog , a mafia hitman  
a twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer , ghost dog is a hilarious contradiction in terms  
unlike the sleek , muscular killing machines one is accustomed to , we are given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly , replete with chapped , dirty hands and rumpled clothing  
he wears a hooded sweatshirt , which he often pulls over his head , giving him a monk-like appearance  
there are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal  
he uses old , worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical , efficient and pleasureless fashion  
ghost dog is a disciple of the old ways of the samurai , distilling the essence of his life through the filter of a book , which he reads daily , hagakure : the way of the samurai  
life consists of simple pleasures for him : ice cream , warm rooftop naps and good books  
ghost dog lives , as it were , by the basic tenet expressed by his book ; one should start each day considering oneself as dead  
living atop an abandoned building , surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons , ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends  
he craves nothing more  
as he puts it late in the film , "" i've seen all i want to see  "" 
he exists in a spiritual world of the mind , gaining moral sustenance from his readings  
ghost dog wasn't always as he is presented  
in several roshomon-like flashbacks , it's shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan , that "" samaritan "" being a foot soldier in an aging crime family  
ghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man , louie ( tormey ) , as repayment  
after years of loyal service , ghost dog is sent , by louie , to kill "" handsome frank "" , a made man within louie's organization who has run away with the crime boss's daughter , louise ( vessey )  
ghost dog wordlessly executes his task , witnessed by louise , whom he spares , as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon , clutching a copy of the book , roshomon  
in a bit of synchronicity , louise loans the book to ghost dog  
upset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family , the mob bosses , in turn , put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade  
the rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict  
the theme of old cartoons flares up time and again , each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog's world  
each time a character is shown watching a cartoon , it's from the same era , betty boop , felix the cat , etc  , a reflection of days gone by  
near the end , louise is watching a cartoon that's a departure from the previously shown ones  
it's a bit of audacity on jarmusch's part that is nicely effective , despite it's surrealistic nature  
as ghost dog floats through his world , his life is touched by two people  
one is a sage little girl ( winbush ) who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading  
she comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities , just as louise ultimately does  
by film's end , the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer  
the other person in ghost dog's world is an ice cream ( de bankole' ) vendor who only speaks french , yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog  
the vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land  
jarmusch , through rapper/composer rza , underscores his film with rap and reggae music , which at first blush seems dichotomous , but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie  
ghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars  
 ( which , in and of itself , presents another paradox about ghost's dog's sense of honor  ) 
the head mafioso is played by henry silva with a stone faced resignation  
of all the cartoonish mobsters , he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world  
gorman plays sonny , a lieutenant who respects the old ways , yet has a quirky affinity for rap music , a love comically shown in several impromptu displays "

1,"i rented "" brokedown palace "" last night blind , having heard nothing about it beforehand , and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws  
for anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety  
that is no easy task  
superficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably "" return to paradise "" and "" midnight express  "" 
as a result nearly every review of "" brokedown palace "" i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons  
the consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as this is a fine film  
for those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was "" midnight express "" ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of "" return to paradise  "" 
in my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad's acclaimed novel , "" lord jim  "" 
problematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world "" justice "" system  
the girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale )  
they're life-long buddies who planned a high-school graduation trip to hawaii , and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents  
once there , they find a $6 hotel and go sight-seeing , which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside  
they get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room , a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them , but they are saved from hotel security by a charming , friendly australian , nick ( daniel lapaine ) , who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl's scam  
he then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves , first toward alice , then toward darlene  
by now alarm bells are going off among viewers  
the ever-present nick is too slick and his stories don't add up ( to us ) --the girls , of course , are too naive to notice  
long before it happens , we're anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast-talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting-ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin  
just as predictably , the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison-bound for a long stretch  
left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice  
for those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl's fleabag hotel  
as one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed , the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer/fixer "" yankee hank "" ( bill pullam ) and his thai-born partner-wife  
a recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film's tag lines , "" who do you trust ? , "" and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullman's oeuvre will find few surprises  
much of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short-hand fashion  
lou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments  
is he part of a wider conspiracy ? 
with an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them  
the result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls' interaction , hank's investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension--as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape  
if "" brokedown palace "" has a major flaw , it is its creators' tendency , like time-constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half-way down and return to the story's main avenue  
and , if that were all there was to "" brokedown palace , "" it wouldn't be a very good movie  
but i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded  
for the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom--in all its permutations  
ultimately , the other sub-themes may be considered window dressing  
young and pretty , alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild , streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure  
presented as a perfect blend of yin and yang , dark and light , is her cautious best friend , darlene ( beckinsale )  
clear-eyed and straightforward , alice is more complex than her friend  
she comes from a poorer background , has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father )  
whereas darlene's life is "" on-track , "" aimed at college , marriage , kids , a career , a suburban home , middle age and "" fulfillment , "" alice's is uncertain , unfocused , and yearning  
one poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors--friends and relatives from home , whose lives continue while hers is in limbo  
tellingly , alice is present but not included  
just as revealing of their different personalities , when alice and dar first come to thailand , the openness and delight on alice's face doesn't read as simple naivet ? ; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat , reaching toward the sun , she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom , while "" dar "" remains seated in the shade  
 "" brokedown palace "" begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank  
however unintentional , it's all alice's fault  
she's responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents , to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand , to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick  
 ( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film's beginning , darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison  ) 
dar , of course , is the willing dupe which , in her view , confers innocence  
never mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate  
dar is innocent  
it doesn't matter  
alice is the subject of this movie  
she and her journey toward personal freedom  
along the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half-baked sensibilities and materialistic goals  
in the end , that culture , like its representatives , "" yankee "" hank and dar's father ( a "" man who knows how to grease the wheels "" ) , proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl's tragedy "

1,"review : a dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in 19th century flanders  
living with his grandfather jehan ( jack warden ) in poverty , nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times ( they are renting a spare one-room cottage , and the greedy , malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them `out of the house' if they don't pay the rent )  
nello also has a rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen , in either a movie or in real life  
 ( his hero is peter paul rubens , the great flemish painter of the 17th century  ) 
not that these are the only things that make nello's life happy , however  
he has a dog of flanders , whom he names patrasche , who is a heroic rin-tin-tin of the 19th century , whom he rescues from his cruel , unkind master  
in addition , he even has a best friend ( and future sweetheart ) in the lovely , wealthy aloise , whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with `lower-class' nello  
 ( he thinks he's not good enough for her , and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying  ) 
but then , he was a poor guy himself before he married ( as mentioned later on in the film )  
one day , nello encounters a mysterious , yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande ( played wonderfully by jon voight ) , who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart , and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist  
and every christmas , there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year ; the winner getting a lot of money  
eager to save his home ( and his aging , dying grandfather ) , nello willingly decides to become an artist , asking aloise to pose for him  
one night , the two travel to a circus , where they have their fortune told ? one of the film's most delightful scenes ? that great happiness is destined for them  
she gives the kids a ring , whom nello places on aloise's hand  
 ; ) afterwards , the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers  
unfortunately , things are not all `la-dee-dah' in this tale  
aloise's father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again  
bad enough that they can't see each other ( although we know nello and aloise , don't we ? ) , but that's only the start of nello's troubles  
aloise's farm is burned down , and nello is wrongfully accused ( by the landord of his cottage ) for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise  
this decreases nello's reputation around the town , save aloise and her parents , and a kindly miller , william , who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by  
matters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies , and he has to pay for his funeral  
but then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home ( for not paying his rental ) ? permanetly  
this means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold , freezing wind  
worst of all , the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time , `the portrait of the princess' , fails to win the prize at the festival  
now nello and patrasche are really depressed , and close to freezing to death  
will nello be able to find any happiness in his life ? 
will patrasche save the day ? 
will nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise ? 
a dog of flanders is a delightful , heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages  
even older ones who consider themselves too `sophisticated' for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grown-ups , too  
there have been other movies of this ilk ( boy and dog ) , and while this one falls into that category , it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties and finding a good home for yourself  
move over ? or rather , roll over ? old yeller , this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight  
the cinematography , courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful , and really adds to the powerful drama of the film  
it also gives a feel of being in flanders ( the whole film was respectably shot in flanders )  
the music from richard friedman is also remarkable ; an evocative , poignant score that recaptures music from the 19th century  
the opening song over the credits is very beautiful ( i hope the soundtrack is available ! ) , and there's a brief excerpt of `cheer up , charlie' from willy wonka and the chocolate factory ( sung by aloise , to nello , in another delightful scene )  
the cast is first-rate : jesse james and jeremy james kissner , who play nello , are some of the most endearing , adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life ( so are the girls who play aloise , madyline sweeten as the younger , and farren monet as the older )  
not that they are the only good stars , however  
jack warden is ideal as jehan , eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character  
 ( the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming , touching ones  ) 
also , bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william  
he's another one of my favorite characters in the film  
but jon voight , as i mentioned before , is the perfect choice for michel  
he brings a mysterious , yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he * can * win the contest  
but what makes this film fun to watch is how well-defined the characters are , and the pace of the story ( best of all , it has a happy ending ? though i will * not * give it away ; sorry ) is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters  
for the first time since the beginning of 1999 , there comes a film which doesn't rely on popular formula stuff , such as big-budget special effects , commercial rock soundtracks , or any of that stuff  
this one relies on telling a fully character-oriented story , with just the right amount of heart , humor , and drama  
that , to me , is what makes a dog of flanders all the more delightful  
eleanor o'sullivan of `the home news & tribune' noticed this , and was kind and generous enough to welcome it : `for want of a better word , a glow surrounds a dog of flanders  
its heart is in the right place and it engages you  
you can guess where the film is going because this is well-traveled territory , but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner , an often-told story is well worth a revisit  ' 
in addition , there were a couple of other enthusiasts , such as chicago-sun times and the washington post ( you should read their reviews ; they're really positive )  
other critics , however , were not so kind  
stephen holden of `the new york times' had more than a share of beatings to lay upon a dog of flanders via pen writing "

1,"in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close-up of a blank movie screen at a drive-in  
we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves  
without an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind's eye  
even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema  
but do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ? 
exploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept  
is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ? 
midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth  
as joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration  
during the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne : the alamo  ' 
as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper ? but he's dead  ' 
a troubled expression comes across joe's face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone  
having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody  
joe's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream  
he romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance  
by the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing  
just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success  
but how realistic are these ideals ? 
joe had raped and been raped in texas  
the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas  
alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation  
the ability to pack up one's belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention  
schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe's abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny  
we understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame  
he runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york  
in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe's encounter with the gay student , joe buck spills ketchup on himself  
standing up , we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh  
schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe's virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation  
beyond the symbol of castration , the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin's first sexual encounter , a reference to joe's first homosexual liaison  
the fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe's emasculation  
it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients , but effortlessly attracts men  
joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff  ' 
there are two predominant images of new york  
the first is that new york is the rich , cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty  
the other new york is travis bickle's new york , a seedy , corruptive hell on earth  
joe envisions new york as the former , but is presented with the latter  
mirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine , he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men  
joe thinks he is performing a great service for new york , but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions  
the people steal joe's money , the landlord confiscates his luggage , and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity  
what has become of joe's american dream ? 
schlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party  
joe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food , drugs , and sex  
at the party , all of joe and ratzo's desires are made flesh ; joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami  
contrasting joe's daily struggles , shots of warhol's crew display wanton indulgence  
there is an irreverence in the partygoers' attitude ; we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular , orgies breaking out in the periphery , and drugs passed around like party favors  
the party makes a mockery of joe' s ideals  
joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america ; scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe's toils  
the american dream , schlesinger suggests , is merely a proletarian fantasy , for those who are content no longer dream , but become indolent  
as joe heads to miami , all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him  
his masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished  
for joe , nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately , he surrenders the identity  
tossing his boots into the garbage , he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami  
the final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus , more introspective , taking only a few glances outside the window

1,"much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of "" lolita , "" made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made , over its use of pedophilia , and as such , it's important to address it straight-forwardly , before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed , as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years , lying around in vaults san a distributor , and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit  
when seeing this film , after all the hoopla , keeping in mind that there are people , namely me , who are fans of the novel , who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation    well , 
you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution  
what's even worse is that seeing this "" lolita , "" especially the first time and if you're familiar with anything "" lolita , "" is admittingly very anticlimactic  
this is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film , ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it , it's really quite a film , perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne ( although , really , look at its competition : "" flashdance , "" "" fatal attraction , "" and "" indecent proposal "" ) , at least besides "" jacob's ladder  "" 
i've seen this "" lolita "" twice : the first time , i wasn't so blown away  
it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting  
the second time , not really thinking about how i've waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i'm seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre , it really affected me emotionally  
the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one , which is why it's such a good novel , and why this is such a good film  
the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a  k  a  lolita is great because it's not trash for the perverted but because it's about human obsession with things that are out of one's reach  
its protagonist , the comically-named humbert humbert , is not your average pedophile , but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies  
the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology , something that will destroy us but that we can't live without  
these ideas are all worked into this film nicely , but done in a way that is not heavy-handed at all , but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating  
the focus of this film , and the reason for making it , it seems , was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images , and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized  
the tone of the book is a comical one , but it's also a tragic one , and humbert , telling the story from his perspective , blows every single thing out of perspective  
humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires , and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed  
we get a sense that perhaps it's by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed  
he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love , and allows himself to embody her as lolita  
he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions , and by the end , he has nothing but overly-dramatic feelings for her  
the story recognizes the extreme of this , almost out of a test , seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert , and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author , vladimir nabokov , wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions , and perhaps bring them to peace  
the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end , when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey , we can easily sympathize and even identify with him  
the opening and final images of the film are the same , and who hasn't done a similar action , that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us ? 
this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen , the first time being filmed in - shock - 1962 , by stanley kubrick , who couldn't possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do , but did the next best thing : he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general  
in that film , he used the traps of society as benefits  
the studio demanded the final scene , that of a heinous murder , come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile    and 
when you see it , it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession  
the censors wouldn't allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the , um , relationship between humbert and lolita , so kubrick decided to play it as comedy , but still allow the tragedy to seep through  
looking at these two versions , especially after reading the novel ( and we all know that when we've read a novel and see a film adaptation , we are bound to be angered by any size differences ) , it's really impossible to compare them  
they both go for different things , and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was  
and although it's true that several scenes are similar , and are thus up for comparison , overall it's unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse  
i have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is , and i won't say that here  
however , this film is pretty amazing , mostly because hey , i loved the book , and this film nearly reminded me of it  
it doesn't have nearly as much wit ( a couple comical scenes , and even a lot of good chuckles , but just not totally witty ) , but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had  
some of that is in the casting of the two leads  
jeremy irons , with his deep , soft british voice and gentle look , is an amazing humbert  
he's droll in a very unique way , and , well , no one can look distraught the way he does  
he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience  
and when he looks at lolita with love , and she looks at him with lust , you know that he's her prisoner for as long as he lives  
and dominique swain , who plays the title character , is rather incredible  
she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original , wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction , bratiness , and self-centeredness that marks the character  
it's easy to see why she surrenders to humbert : she loves the attention , and knows that she can have her way with him at any time  
when he denies her something , she blackmails him effortlessly ( a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic ) , and when he stands up to her , she weeps and runs away , leaving humbert to follow her  
there are two other minor characters in the film , one who's a road block in the beginning , and the other who's a reappearing threat to the relationship  
the former is charlotte , lolita's mother , played by melanie griffith  
in the book , charlotte is a monster of a woman : overbearing , constantly scolding her child , overly-religious , and ultimately selfish "

1,"the reunion film is not an original idea in any way , shape , or form  
it's been done throughout film history over and over again , and has become one of the many sub-genres , like the prep school sub-genre , the angst-filled teen sub-genre , and the slasher sub-genre  
what makes "" peter's friends "" so remarkable is not how it doesn't follow the rules of this sub-genre , but how it follows it so well , and creates characters that i wouldn't mind hanging with  
what are the rules of the reunion sub-genre ? 
well     
1  you need a group of friends , most of them married or at least dating , and sometimes even married or dating eachother  
2  you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis  
3  they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart  
4  the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10  
5  they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic  
6  the reunion has to bring them together , seperate them with little crises , then bring them back together because , after all , they're friends  
7  there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited  
8  eightly , they're all unhappy or marginally so  
9  there's some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that's built up over the years  
10  the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts , sometimes internationally so  
11  the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends , sometimes causing them to get together in dance/song  
since it follows these rules so closely , it will probably be ( and has been ) coined off as just a "" british 'big chill  ' "" 
and in some ways it is  
both follow the rules , as i said , and both feature lots of bitching , big confessionals , and broken relationships  
but while "" the big chill "" was , at least to me , a tad too whiny and unsatisfying , "" peter's friends "" hits its mark , making this film funny , dramatic , and poignant  
the friends of peter's were all in the same theatre group back in '82 , performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them ( the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus )  
after peter's ( stephen fry ) wealthy father ( richard briers , hardly on screen enough to register , but oh well ) dies , leaving a giant mansion to him , he has to decide whether or not to keep it  
not sure what to do with it immeadiately , he decides to throw a giant reunion party , inviting back all his old chums  
of course , all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule  
andrew ( kenneth branagh , also directing here ) is an actor who's unhappily married to a tv star , carol ( co-writer rita rudner )  
maggie ( emma thompson ) is a successfuly publisher of self-help books , but looks like she needs them more than her customers , as she is lonely and unhappy  
roger and mary ( hugh laurie and imelda staunton , who were also married in "" sense and sensibility "" ) are married , and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk , but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died  
and sarah ( alphonsia emmanuel ) is as promiscuous as ever , having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian ( tony slattery ) who's married and wants a divorce because of her , giving her doubts  
as for peter , things seem okay    
the film features lots of inner-friend jokes , and even some old theatre anecdotes ( which i at least find a lot of fun in , as i've done lots of theatre myself )  
and there are big confessions , brawls between the friends , and by the end , almost everyone is unhappy , even though some have resolved their problems long before the end ( which i kinda dug )  
the final twist would seem forced an anti-climactic , but for some reason , i felt the same way the rest of the friends did  
maybe it's because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique  
that's really what makes "" peter's friends "" so lovable : the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes , but when someone's in crisis , can come together wonderfully for one another  
it's when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends , and these people are true friends  
not to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s ( a decade i grew up in , unfortunately ) without taking us outside of the 90s "

1,"seen august 8 , 1998 at 6 p  m  at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam , ny ) , theater #6 , by myself for free using my sony/loews critic's pass  
[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] 
war is a topic that can't help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media  
movies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory  
it's easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other  
forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number  
 "" saving private ryan "" is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery  
it proves there's a huge difference between battling and killing  
the film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory  
it's world war ii , d-day to be exact , and the u  s  military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them  
spielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality  
instead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared  
there is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops  
 "" poor "" is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are  
there is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters  
we don't get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding  
the nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they're there  
in the movies , the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch , but in reality that wouldn't happen  
the men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies  
they are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well-secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they're shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off  
perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme  
the film seems to rely on the audience's sense of patriotism , that the american military is "" right "" and good and that the nazis are "" inherently evil  "" 
the battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50-foot progression ) , and begin to inflict some damage  
i have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up , i couldn't help but feel some sense of joy and relief  
to triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure , but there's nothing cliche about the graphic , detailed , atmosphere here because it really happened  
one of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is , and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting  
the plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet  
tom hanks stars as captain miller , a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon  
he's never obsessive or any such generic , cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this  
he doesn't want to be there any more than his men , but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out  
the mission the film is concerned with is , as the title states , saving private ryan  
through a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker , it is brought to a general's attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each's death simultaneously  
when they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe , they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother  
it's easy to sympathize with this situation , after all , no one should have to lose all their children at once  
but finding one man in this war is , as miller puts it , "" like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles  "" 
the saving of private ryan isn't just a dramatic device , but a thematic one  
his salvation represents the sense of innocence the country , the world even , was trying to convince itself it still had  
when miller's company hears of the mission , they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead , but miller isn't so quick to shrug it off  
he knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope , and now he has the opportunity to make someone's sense of hope a reality  
the mission to find ryan gives miller's group a destination , but not direction  
along the way many things happen to them , both good and bad  
a few battles are fought , not to be major accomplishments for the war , but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice  
the act of killing itself becomes one of the film's major philosophical metaphors  
the soldiers don't mind killing other soldiers in blind battle , but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go , they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses  
unfortunately , death is a fact of war , and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters , but here spielberg doesn't want us to think these men are invincible  
in fact , only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man , and the performances are good enough to make this method work  
although the characters are somewhat typical , the actors maintain control over the material at all time  
whether they're arguing with each other , telling stories of back home , or fighting the germans , they never go overboard and always seem believable "

1,"this has some major spoilers for the film , so be forwarned  
the won't appear till later in the article , so you're safe for now  
eyes wide shot ( 1999 ) running time : 2 hours 39 minutes 2  35 : 1 theatrical aspect 
starring : tom cruise ( dr  
bill hardford ) , nicole kidman ( alice hardford ) , sidney pollack , leelee sobieski , todd field ( nick nightingale ) directed , co-written , produced by : stanley kubrick inspired by : "" traumnovelle "" by : arthur schnitzer 
this is an interesting film  
i must first off state , that you musn't believe any of the rumors of the film  
cruise is not a cross dresser , kidman doesn't shoot heroin , and there's not any scene between the two that would suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist  
the look of the film is to suggest that it follows the translation of the inspired book from the film was written  
the translation , "" dream novel , "" makes you thing that the film should have been titled dream film  
there is a noticable amount of graininess to the film  
rather than complain about it as some may and already have , see it as a style of shooting  
i would gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this and shot with as much natural light as he could  
this and the film looks like it was pushed another two stops to add more grain and brighten it slightly  
as an auteur and stickler for details , kubrick seemed to be a bit lax on this one  
the film looks great , but there are a good deal of bloopers/flubs that occur  
you see lots of boom shots ( in reflection ) and you see the camera at least twice  
16 months for this ? 
wow  
reflection is the biggest killer for this film  
their apartment and almost everything in the film casts reflections and the crew can be seen in these , some quite glaringly  
one more topic of heated discussion : i saw the "" austin powers "" version , and to be perfectly frank , unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be , you'll probably not see them  
two girls standing next to each other look a little suspicious , but i can wait for the unrated version on video to see it the way it's supposed to be  
spoilers below : 
the film itself starts with ( cruise ) bill and ( kidman ) alice getting ready for a little x-mas soiree  
they go to a quite elegant party in what seems to be a storagehouse for lighting equipment , which is actually an apartment owned by pollack  
bill runs into an old friend from medical school who is now the party's entertainment  
soon after , bill and alice are flirting with others at the party , thinking that the other has not noticed  
bill is called to help with a partygoer who has had a bit too much of a good time  
the next day , bill and alice , casually smoking marijunana in their bedroom discuss the previous nights flirtations  
they both discover that they both knew about the flirting  
bill starts talking about what women can provide in a relationship , and gets alice extremely angry  
in her hazy state , she tells of an opportunity she almost acted on to cheat on bill , not caring about the possible aftereffects  
bill gets called away when one of his patients dies , and goes to console his daughter  
when his patient's engaged daughter makes a plea for his love and affection , he is struck with images of an affair that never occured between his wife , alice and a naval officer  
he sees "" opportunity "" as a betrayal to his wife , and before they can continue , they are interrupted  
as he strolls home , he encounters a hooker  
seeing another "" opportunity "" arise , he follows the hooker home  
they toy around , but before the act ensues , alice calls his cell phone  
he breaks the date with the hooker , and heads back out into the night  
he passes a lounge and notices that his old medical school buddy is playing , so he heads in  
when he meets the friend , the friend reveals that for extra scratch , he plays these strange parties , while blindfolded  
bill is intrigued and wants to go to one  
nick reluctantly sets him up with directions and a password  
what follows this is a short meeting where bill obtains a costume for this party and meets a young girl , leelee sobieski , and her father  
the young girl has drawn his eye , but her young age , and the prescence of her father deter this from happening  
he gets to the party , which is to say the least , a strange affair  
after partaking in some strange "" religious "" right , women and men pair off for the orgy to end all orgies  
a woman warns bill in disguise , that he should leave before he is exposed as a fraud at the party  
he is detained after a second warning , where he is outed for not being in the group  
after getting home , he hides the evidence of his evenings events  
unable to carry on in his day , he tries piece the events of the previous night together  
in the process , he finds that nick has disappeared , his life is possibly in danger , and the woman that warned him has died  
i'm trying to save a bit of the film here , it's worth sitting through to get to this point "

1,"shakespeare  you hardly understood it in high school  
why would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn't count on it ? 
if this is your attitude , then i'll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh's hamlet is probably not for you , and you might as well stop reading right now  
if , however , you are a lover of the bard , or at the very least are open-minded about a challenging script , read on , for there is something rotten in the state of denmark  
namely , the king has died , and his widow the queen has wed the king's brother , claudius , but prince hamlet suspects foul play  
his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother's hands  
hamlet , enlisting the help of his friend horatio , conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery     and 
the game is afoot     
the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes  
with external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england ( also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers ) , the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established  
interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers  
the hamlet castle's grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings , mirror-panel doors , and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second-story loft  
costuming is equally grand , drawing upon both history and imagination   
not quite the denmark of the 1600's , the characters' attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia , very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel  
it is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars , respectively  
in addition to directing , kenneth branagh also plays the title character  
as the revenge-driven royal heir , branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows  
from the anticipation of seeing his father's ghost , to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester , to his eventual wrath , branagh delivers in spades  
every scene truly revolves around hamlet , as much a tribute to branagh's acting and directing as to shakespeare's manuscript  
hamlet seems to be a who's who of shakespearean-trained actors , so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself  
julie christie , as hamlet's mother gertrude , and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly , as do many of the supporting players  
kate winslet as hamlet's lover ophelia , does an outstanding job demonstrating the character's plummet to the depths of dispair and madness  
richard briers as ophelia's father , polonius , and michael moloney as her brother , laertes , are equally convincing  
nicholas farrell as hamlet's trusted friend horatio , and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the two-timing rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast  
hamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible  
in some cases , this made for interesting scenes  
billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick , whom hamlet knew quite well  
crystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian , and the result is a very funny scene  
however , charleton heston , whom many might think would butcher shakespeare , is the biggest surprise of all  
as the player king , the leader of a troupe of traveling actors , he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba  
part of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story ( with sir john gielgud and judi dench ) , but this is most unfortunate , for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time  
his off-camera speaking , while gripping , sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well-voiced actor  
i wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out , and let the venerable actor have the attention  
unfortunately , there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions  
jack lemmon , an excellent actor , just can't do shakespeare  
as marcellus , the guard who sees the elder hamlet's ghost , lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him  
gerard depardieu , another talented actor , is wasted when given little more than the utterances of "" yes , my lord "" and "" no , my lord "" in the role of reynaldo  
richard attenborough has a ( literally ) walk-on role , showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador  
i think he had two lines  
then there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway  
when i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year , two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was  
if bulging eyes are your idea of handsome , well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you  
hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one  
branagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback-type images "

1,"virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre  
since 'dark city' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another  
the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix  
all the films released after it , have been less successful  
david cronenberg's existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone  
and when 'the thirteenth floor' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored  
i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again  
it was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to 'the thirteenth floor'  
however , i was positively surprised by josef rusnak's latest picture  
matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood's action and effects with an intelligent story  
existenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness  
'the thirteenth floor' is somewhere in between  
instead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , 'the thirteenth floor' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding  
in a near future    on 
the thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real  
right after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered  
douglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth  
a beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence  
the first "" download into simulation "" is impressive  
it is the creator's first visit to his world , his creation  
in order to enter this virtual universe , you have to take over someone's identity , become another person  
this is called conciseness transfer , and this is part of the tragedy in the film : people "" wake up "" in unknown places and strange things start happen  
they start to doubt in their own sanity  
these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their "" users "" and creators with their sanity and their lives  
it is a frightening reality ; the fact that all the people in the simulation ( the program links ) are living out their lives , oblivious , not knowing that they are puppets in someone's fantasy  
with an appealing ( "" blade runner "" - type ) of detective story , this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present  
our modern world is metal and glass -- cold , unfriendly , impersonal  
the thirties are different -- colorful , beautiful , elegant , virile  
this contrast demonstrates a wish for change  
virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical , enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities  
to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise , to some a personal playground -- a life without any consequences  
for others - a way to start over and "" correct "" their mistakes , by living in an illusion of their past  
virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes , dreams and fantasies to life  
at least that's how it is all beginning  
but when you're waking up from your dream , the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise  
this , almost narcotic effect , soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness  
some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised -- what is real ? 
what is thought ? 
who are we ? 
if these were answered , this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made  
they are off course not answered , but posed in an intelligent manner  
the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements , since it portrays the contrast between these computer-simulated universes  
kirk m  petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour , grace and color ; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties  
there are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose's moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time  
a rather unusual thing about'the thirteenth floor' is the almost complete lack of special effects  
there are no cgi animated creatures , no bullets in slow motion  
this is a more philosophical approach , reminding about the european way of filmmaking  
this is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians , but the more serious science fiction buffs and 'dark city'-fans will be pleased  
this film is interesting and inspiring  
it has everything existenz doesn't , but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix  
and then there is a happy end which , like in 'dark city' , completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context "
1,"when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be "" you too can believe whales can fly ""  
then it was going to be "" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly ""  
then , it was going to be "" you too can believe wood sprites can fly ""  
finally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say    
there's a lot of flying going on in this film ! 
as our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in  
well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released  
part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release )  
subsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved )  
to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high  
in an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us  
after the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters  
is the format effective for the film ? 
with a few exceptions , yes  
the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven's fifth symphony  
it's hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily  
everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts  
eventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things  
though this segment isn't very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies  
the next segment is set to ottorino respighi's "" the pines of rome ""  
in this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape  
a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack  
he is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the "" oceans "" of clouds  
again , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved  
reportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size  
the cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images  
one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent  
absolutely beautiful stuff  
the third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin's "" rhapsody in blue ""  
this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york  
there's a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife  
i won't go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending  
unfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments  
segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich's "" piano concerto no  2 "" and is an animated version of hans christian andersen's "" the steadfast tin soldier ""  
a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can't see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester  
the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina  
little does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from  
the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl  
although the ending has been altered from the andersen story , "" the steadfast tin soldier "" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short  
some children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made  
segment five is the funniest of the bunch  
set to camille saint-saens "" the carnival of the animals "" , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo-yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number  
while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy  
segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it's the one that people remember most , "" the sorcerer's apprentice ""  
the story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo  
unfortunately , the segment wasn't made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain  
there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain  
similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18-plus screen theaters  
segment seven is set to sir edward elgar's "" pomp and circumstance march no  1 "" and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character "

1,"matthew broderick and high school comedy  
the two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986  
now it is 13 years later , and broderick has another high school comedy , election , to show the world  
ferris buehler's day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows  
it was light , fluffy , tasty , and sparkling clean  
but election is far different  
this production is a dark , and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies ; it shocks as well  
jim mcallister ( matthew broderick ) is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud  
he is a kind , caring , younger man who has built his life around carver high school  
in turn , carver high school has provided a home for him  
jim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span , and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body  
tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an intelligent , outgoing , and , to quote the film , "" super nice "" young girl  
she is involved in numerous extracurricular activities , always has her hand up first in class , and is extremely popular among most of the student body  
so , it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president  
the metzler family is an extremely wealthy one  
the father , dick ( holmes osborne ) , owns a cement company  
the mother , jo ( jeanine jackson ) , is an ideal housewife  
and the two children , paul ( chris klein ) and tammy ( jessica campbell ) , are both students at carver high school  
paul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself , and is definitely a candidate for most popular person in school  
tammy is a lesbian who , to say the least , is going through a period of self discovery  
for reasons of revenge , hatred , and sexual envy , jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president  
he claims that in a democracy you need choices , and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts  
so paul agrees and the race is on  
but then , in an effort to spite the two candidates , tammy announces that she is running as well  
her campaign is straightforward : people only run to put it on their college applications , then they do nothing  
well , "" i don't even want to go to college , "" she says  
in election , there are no "" good guys ""  
almost everyone has their own agenda  
no matter how deeply hidden , the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience  
tracy is the type of person that you remember from high school  
she is the girl that would be labeled "" most likely to achieve anything she wants "" in the yearbook , and everyone secretly envied her because of that  
jim is a teacher that takes the trust that students give him as a privilege , and uses it to his own amoral advantage  
everyone , including the principal , a former teacher , all the candidates , and even paul's girlfriend are two sided characters  
that is much of this film's beauty , it doesn't have the typical good guys that hollywood likes , instead it is a realistic portrayal of the real world , specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themselves  
matthew broderick couldn't have been any more perfect for this role  
his character is often similar bill murray's award winning role in the 1998 film , rushmore  
of the two acting jobs , broderick's is far superior  
but even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon  
the hatred that she causes the audience to develop towards her , is simply indescribable  
broderick and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes  
one such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day  
you can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures , making her an eligible candidate  
and his subtle disgust with her is apparent , although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to put on a happy face  
the supporting cast is one with little hollywood experience  
but that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part  
however , the real treat is jessica campbell in her confused role as a young homosexual girl  
this is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her so-called platform for presidency  
she is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed  
if ferris buehler made you feel good about american high schools , and gave you an innocent laugh or two , then the movie achieved its goal  
but don't you dare think that election's goals are similar  
it is just as real in its portrayal of high school , as its characters are in the real world "

1,"the makers of jurassic park & the director of speed conjure up a storm ! 
 ( reviewed at eng wah's new jubilee cineplex at ang mo kio ) 
 "" unlike earthquakes , their fury is precise  
unlike hurricanes , their reach is unlimited  
unlike fires , there is no way to combat them  
unlike floods , their terror is sudden  "" 
- excerpt from twister production notes 
i'm sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen tornadoes ( or twisters ) before  
i for one , have only seen the devastating effects and footage of tornadoes from news reports on tv and personally , i feel tornado-caused destruction comes no where near the destruction caused by hurricanes and earthquakes         that is until i saw twister  
the destruction caused by twisters may be precise ( not widespread but it moves very fast and its path of destruction is unpredictable  
it will suck in cars , houses , livestock , etc      
basically anything in its path that is not firmly rooted to the ground and in twister , you'll get to see all this - close up ! 
twister tells a tale about a group of storm chasers  
these people are basically out-of-their-mind and for the sake of obtaining data on twister-occurrences , they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes , trying to get as close as they can      that 
is if the tornado does not suddenly decide to change its path towards them ! 
jo ( helen hunt ) is the leader of this pack of kamikazes  
while they are gearing up for the mother-of-all-storms as predicted by satellite recon , bill ( bill paxton ) , a former co- leader of the team returns to settle some divorce papers with jo  
apparently , bill has left his rogue-ish days for greener and more practical pastures - as a television weatherman  
he catches up with his old-self and follows the pack like the good ole days , bringing his wife-to-be melissa ( jamie gertz ) along , a city-bred woman toting around with a handphone  
jo has finally implemented bills initial idea of a device called dorothy which measurement's of a twister may lead to a better understanding on how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable early-warning system can be implemented  
the problem is , the device has to be placed very near the twister , and in its path ( which is practically unpredictable ) of destruction in order for it to function  
to add to their current challenge , there is another group of storm chasers that is corporation-funded led by jonas ( cary elwes ) and they too have a similar device  
thus begins the race ; jo's cheap government equipment with beaten-up vehicles against jonas's high-tech computers and satellite link-ups with their sleek , black all-terrain vans  
plot wise , there are not really anything to shout about  
twister is as predictable as any summer box-office hit can get  
there is the danger of the twister , the competition with jonas^os more well-off team and of course , the settling of differences between jo and bill ( this part gives the film its human substance )  
helen hunt , bill paxton and the rest of the actors/actresses give only average performances and all of them take back seat to the main thespian in this movie - the twister itself ! 
thanks to the impressive digital effects by ilm ( lucasfilm's industrial light and magic ) , we get to see the terror and destruction caused by tornadoes up close ; from stripping barns and houses to lifting up livestock ! 
jan de bont once again proves his visual abiility ( thanks to his years of experience as a director of photography for action films ) for action sequences  
like his previous film speed , the tornado sequences ( which are essentially the action sequences ) are well visualised and edited  
audiences will be holding tight to their chairs everytime a tornado comes on screen ! 
the surround sound effects sure does help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister ! 
 ( the cinema must at the very least support digital sound to fully appreciate this ) twister is definitely an effect-dependent movie  
now that id4 fever has begun to reside , and people are getting bored of watching will smith whoop et's ass for the umpteenth time       twister is your sure bet of 7 bucks well spent ! 
watch it in a good theatre    please  
the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video "

1,"i'm an avid fan of the "" alien "" saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it )  
of course , that doesn't mean that i'm gonna be giving this a four-star review or something , because "" alien : resurrection , "" the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were  
however , it's a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series  
in short , i had a good time  
 "" alien : resurrection "" leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre's answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one  
of course , the last one wasn't very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn't financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! )  
so back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that's a bad thing , but it's becoming a cliche )  
so she's cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called "" the auriga "" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr  wren , played by j  e  freeman , as well as the little-seen dr  gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her  
once you get past the fact that you can't figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film's okay  
also on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and    winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won't state it , but unless you've been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it's nicely covered up )  
there's a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it's never really deepened enough  
oh well  
well , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship  
and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who's death is comical yet sad since , well , he's dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth  
of course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old "" alien "" -brand fun  
the real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there's always a bit of it , most notably in "" aliens "" with the relationship between ripley and the little girl )  
what's interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach  
 "" alien "" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights  
 "" aliens "" is a wild , tense thriller  
 "" alien 3 "" is a bleak , moody piece of semi-noir  
 "" alien 4 "" is kind of like an off-beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares  
jean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like "" das boot "" has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat  
the chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there's the most tense surgery scene since "" face/off "" towards the beginning )  
and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that  
this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others  
there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed  
one is the aforementioned surgery scene  
another one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome  
the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet's earlier film , "" delicatessen "" )  
and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to "" goldfinger "" )  
but the best scene in the entire film ( i'm sure i'm not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an "" 8 "" tatooed on her arm )  
it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga  
the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters  
however , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there's very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow , we are pretty scared  
and , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : "" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! "" 
johner : "" well , i can get you off  
but not this ship  "" ) 
the acting is good all around , with stand-out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner , and leland orser ( the poor bastad in "" se7en "" who performed the "" lust "" sin ) as an anxiety-ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him  
winona ryder is good , but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film )  
of course , and as usual , sigourney weaver steals the show  
playing a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional , and more rude and bitter ) , she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable  
she's not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for "" aliens , "" but she's just awesome  
overall , it's a thrilling , entertaining film which doesn't really amaze like the first two , but is much more amazing than the third installment  
the style is the best part of the film , which isn't really a bad thing , but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply  
but it's entertaining as hell , and it's definitely fit for the "" alien "" series "

the previous two "" alien "" films have each had their own unique styles to them  
the ridley scott's alien was very much a stylistic suspense film  
james cameron's aliens was much more of an action film  
and i liked each film separately for which it was  
now alien 3 is out  
and it is it's own film in the same right that alien and aliens were  
unlike aliens , alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens  
this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off  
the survivors of the expedition to lv-426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens  
the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item , an egg  
in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch , find its quarry , which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured , an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel  
this vessel crash lands on fury 109  
everyone in the vessel is killed , except ripley  
the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash  
fury 109 is an ex-mining/maximum security prison  
when closed down , some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet  
all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years  
ripley's arrival sparks a problem with the inmates  
as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner's sport , there is an infestation of lice on the planet  
being an ex-prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons  
so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own  
i will not go into detail , but you can guess what happens here  
the alien is loose and no one believes ripley's outstanding story  
she finds comfort in the arms of the colony's doctor  
yes , after 57 years ripley has sex  
it is not gratuitous , in fact , we don't even see them kiss , but it is just as well  
a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film  
there is a lot more gore in alien 3  
in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two  
it also sports a new alien with 4 legs ! 
i won't say how , but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle , which i am sure will be explored in alien 4  
sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character  
her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination  
the rest of the cast is also quite good  
notably , charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109  
alien 3 has a very distinct look  
this is due largely to its director , david fincher  
mr  fincher , who until now has only directed music videos and commercials , has done an incredible job here  
his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no "" alien "" film has before  
for mr  fincher , i see a long prosperous career ahead of him  
the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry  
elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the "" alien "" series been set in  
this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii ( james horner's aliens )  
this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring  
this is a great score  
the ending to alien 3 is quite good  
there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up , but it played very nicely  
i will not ruin the ending for you  
go see the film  
i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season "

1,"there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor's effort  
often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile  
when one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders  
but sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with "" the hurricane  "" 
this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin "" hurricane "" carter would normally be called "" norman jewison's 'the hurricane , ' "" as per the tradition of referring to a film "" belonging "" to a director  
but though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of "" the hurricane , "" because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington  
washington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late-night shooting in a bar  
jailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals  
the situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter  
through the efforts of that group and carter's lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted  
the film details carter's childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya )  
when he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide  
despite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned  
flash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african-american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison  
the book , entitled "" the sixteenth round , "" opens young lesra's eyes to the injustice that was carter's life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer  
lesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal  
 "" the hurricane "" leans on denzel washington  
he must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly  
it's probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter , because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be  
it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the film  
the actor's work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm's length  
we feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost  
washington's is a performance of weight and emotional depth  
he doesn't merely play angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level  
his work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor  
norman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection  
 "" the hurricane "" moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely  
jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is , and nothing is terribly confusing  
his boxing scenes , constructed with clear inspiration from "" raging bull , "" get inside the action very well , and they are believable as real sports footage  
jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform , and jewison , assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington , shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude , and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell  
jewison's best achievement in "" the hurricane "" is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard-knock life , and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again  
sadly , though , the film's chief failures lie with the screenplay , as with most of the good-but-not-great efforts to round the pike this winter  
there is much to interest a viewer in "" the hurricane , "" but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich ? d route possible , it does  
take a look at the supporting characters , for example , who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil  
carter and lesra ( played nicely by shannon , who deserves credit ) are the only real people here ; everyone else is a stereotype  
the canadians are good  
the cops are bad  
the canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey-dovey commune ( and it is a commune , despite the film's failure to make that clear ) , while every racist cop ( especially dan hedaya's ) melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room  
much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey ( "" hate put me in prison  
love's gonna bust me out  "" ) , and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made-for-tv lifetime special  
it's too bad  
the cast is game , the director does his job , and the subject matter is interesting , but the script takes the safer , slightly more boring route far too often  
i wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than "" he's a racist pig  "" 
i wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice  
in short , i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens  
criticism has been levied against the liberties "" the hurricane "" takes with the truth of what really happened to carter , and much of it is deserved  
for example , the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello , only to be screwed by the judges , who ruled giardello the winner  
most accounts of the fight , however , have carter losing fairly  
furthermore , much of carter's criminal past is conveniently left out of the film , and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained  
of course , "" the hurricane "" works mainly as a fable , so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially , but even dismissing such issues don't remove one fact : "" the hurricane "" is a highly flawed film "

1,"i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files  
first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie  
the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable  
you have to reach for a larger audience  
therefore , the movie is quite user-friendly  
altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange  
but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on  
you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera  
in any case , the answer is no  
i am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium  
however , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie  
i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new  
everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others  
i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie  
warning : major spoilers follow ! 
please do not read , to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird "" hummm "" sound is all about  
you have been warned  
the x-files is what a summer should be  
exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances  
this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank  
from start to finish , this movie does not let go of you  
when i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon  
this flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes  
in fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue  
you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! 
the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid  
you know , when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? 
so yeah , the x-files is scary  
and guess what ? 
you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster  
do not think that the x-files is a monster movie  
in fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total  
no , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series  
scully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time  
she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much  
no , this is mulder's time in the spotlight  
by now , you have heard of the scene where mulder "" showers "" independence day  
if you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let's just say that due to recent events mulder should be "" showering "" godzilla instead  
to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there    who 
cares ! ? 
if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? 
the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous  
the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill  
the script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose  
if you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! 
unlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects  
miss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense  
also , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies    don't ! 
the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation  
there is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? 
 ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose  
who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a "" big emotional scene "" between godzilla attacks ? 
so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i'd recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose  
but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is  
what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ? 
cool effects ? 
it's good some  
pulse pounding ? 
hell yes ! 
strangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time "

1,"in intolerance , d  w  griffith told four different historical stories at the same time , cutting from one to the other  
each of the stories builds to a fast-paced climax  
in magnolia , paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others  
yet the stories and where they are going are all independent  
what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized  
each story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment ) but then lets the tension dissolve  
while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along , even though they are not in the same scene  
then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again  
it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked  
this creates some strange effects  
the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships  
the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content  
we have the story of a dying man earl partridge ( jason robards ) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends  
phil parma ( philip seymour hoffman ) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal  
partridge's young wife linda ( julianne moore ) is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies , but for an unsuspected reason  
frank mackey ( tom cruise ) runs the kinds of self-help seminar that businesses like so much , but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit-heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women's lib  
officer jim kurring ( john c  reilly ) is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place  
jimmy gator ( philip baker hall ) hosts a popular children's tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector ( jeremy blackman ) and former quiz kid donnie smith ( william h  macy )  
the film juggles all these stories for over three hours , but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily  
each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax , but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story  
the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories  
the film seems to be built around strange events and weird history , but it really has little to do with the content of the stories , though they all are connected in part by one weird event  
magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson , though in my opinion his two previous films , hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories  
it is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson's company  
john c  reilly seems to be a standard fixture  
particularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight  
here he several of the characters are mesmerizing , but that characteristic is not really used  
as studies of characters these stories are each worth following  
as well-rounded stories with a beginning , middle and end , they leave something to be desired  
but the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through  
i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale  
heavy spoiler    
heavy spoiler    
heavy spoiler    
heavy spoiler    
during the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen  
and in actual fact , it does  
since biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods "

1,"the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster 
the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman 
the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider  
when those observers are joel and ethan coen , the surreal becomes bizarre  
when the life is that of jeff "" the dude "" leboswki , the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of "" what'sgoingonaroundhere ""  
the marvelous sound of "" the stranger "" ( sam elliot ) 's voice-over introduces the film  
at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up  
the dude ( jeff bridges ) is described as the "" laziest man in los angeles , possibly the world "" , although he's not so much slothful as he is relaxed  
spending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doesn't have much of a life , but he's having a good time  
when asked what he does for fun , he responds "" bowl , drive around and the occasional acid flashback ""  
lebowski's passion is bowling  
when he's not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike , things just happen to him  
arriving home one night , he's beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them  
even worse , they urinate on his rug  
the problem is that the dude doesn't have a wife  
his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment  
the "" big "" lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionaire and his dudeness lives in two-room squalor  
the next day , our ragtag hero visits his namesake's mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug  
the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it's virtually the only object there  
when he's denied any money , he picks up a replacement rug off the floor  
on his way out , he runs into lebowski's trophy babe wife bunny ( tara reid ) who offers to perform a sexual act that , according to rumor , is one of bill clinton's favorites for a thousand bucks  
the penniless dude wisecracks that he's heading for the cash machine  
later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny's kidnappers  
this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes-gone-wrong sequences  
the kidnappers are impossibly inept  
the dude and his cronies are even worse  
every plan goes awry  
you can almost see lebowski's brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues  
that's the story , but to tell the truth it doesn't much matter  
there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining  
the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into  
the dude's bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you'd see on the street but , like everything else in this film , they're not quite what they seem  
walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties  
everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam  
when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won't admit it , walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet  
donny gets precious few words in between walter's screaming and the dude's rambling  
when he does , walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns  
donny is "" out of his league "" and doesn't "" have a frame of reference ""  
the film is peppered with people for whom the term "" character "" would be an understatement  
the big lebowski's daughter maude , an avant-garde "" vaginal "" artist , paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s&m mary martin  
the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers  
bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star  
most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler  
as the flamenco music swells , we see him putting on his lavender hose  
the camera pans up to an all-purple skin-tight bowling outfit with "" jesus "" ( pronounced with a "" j "" , not an "" h "" ) embroidered on the pocket  
he addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail  
his tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball  
bridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has  
i can't think of anyone else who could have done a better job  
buscemi has a limited role , but he plays it perfectly  
the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he's one of the treasures of our time  
it's odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr's television husband  
more like the coen's "" raising arizona "" than their hit "" fargo "" , "" the big lebowski "" demands an open mind and even more open eyes "

1,"titantic , writer and director james cameron's much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ? 
as a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful  
if you've already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again  
the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world's most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers  
in either case , it is filmmaking at its best  
when we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long  
he said no but that the time would go by so fast she'd never notice the length  
amazingly , he was right  
titanic is one of the few long films that doesn't suffer because of it  
the lush picture , filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm , opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean  
fortune hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) leads the expedition looking for the world's most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship , known back then as "" the ship of dreams  "" 
the necklace's hundred-year-old former owner , rose dewitt bukater ( gloria stuart ) , finds brock to tell him her story  
although almost all of the movie happens in flashback , one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk  
using a computer simulation , the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later , which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing  
after twenty minutes , the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage  
in a classic movie theme , the two parts of the ship , first class and steerage ( third-class ) exist in sharp contrast  
the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing  
entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance , cal hockley , played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane  
and thanks to a last minute winning poker hand , an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class  
even with her own promenade deck , rose feels trapped on the ship , what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes  
in contrast , jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board  
after jack saves rose from committing suicide , they start a brief but impassioned love affair  
never tawdry and rarely explicit , their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story  
leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma  
in so many ways , small and large , he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part  
when he confronts cal , for example , he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal's supercilious put-downs  
kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose  
the chemistry between these two academy award nominees , him for what's eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility , is nothing short of astonishing  
from the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship's bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude , they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances  
if the film breaks after an hour and a half , which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up , you will still get one of the best films of the year  
peter lamont's sets are more than authentic  
one scene , for example , starts with the planning-to-retire captain , played with insouciance by bernard hill , having his tea on deck  
it then shifts to the ship's massive gears and then to the bright-hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals  
the handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner  
easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest  
at first , since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull , not some big gaping hole , the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else  
what a lark  
we've struck an iceberg  
now let's get back to our brandy and cigars  
the ship's musicians play like troopers through it all , even after the panic sets in  
after all , they see it as their duty to calm the passengers  
when the musicians are about to die , they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together , and they mean it  
their civility borders on insanity , but it is touching nevertheless  
the story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface  
there are more than enough characters to love and to hate , and all of the casting is dead-on  
special effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable  
in titanic , for which he created a nine-tenths scale model of the entire ship , cameron strove for accuracy at all costs  
the most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two , and the front section becomes vertical in the water  
people are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately  
besides being romantic and dramatic , the script includes liberal doses of humor  
from the many deliciously subtle verbal put-downs to the physical comedy , as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man , the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears  
 "" it's good-bye for a little while , "" a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first "
1,"are you tired of all the hot new releases being gone by the time you get to the video store ? 
wafflemovies  com is dedicated to finding those hidden gems that lie on the shelves  
everyweek , wafflemovies  com 
reviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video  
here is a sample review : 
welcome to sarajevo 
in light of america's recent intervention in kosovo , welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years  
set in sarajevo 1992 and based on actual events , this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war  
the picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding  
as they make their way down the street , a sniper shoots the mother of the bride  
yet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war  
in this scene , we meet joe flynn ( woody harrelson ) , an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church  
joe is cocky , but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesn't even know  
his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson ( stephen dillane )  
michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the world's lack of interest  
henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mother's death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread  
he decides to take action when a united nations' delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth  
henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines  
he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult  
during his visits , he befriends a pre-teen girl , emira ( emira nuseric ) who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner  
he promises to get emira out of harm's way if he gets the chance  
after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children , henderson loses hope  
however , his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina ( marisa tomei ) and her children's aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans  
unfortunately , only babies are wanted for adoption , so henderson pledges to take emira to england  
the group of children , nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy  
can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps ? 
the movie was beautifully and sensitively made  
director michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred  
they show the destroyed lives , families that have been split up , and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with  
this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson , his producer and flynn have befriended  
the group of twenty-somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life's simplest pleasures and amenities  
one of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth  
like the rest of those deeply effected by the war , this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live  
winterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room  
the picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the 1984 olympics  
winterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities  
this portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies  com 
selection mad city  
we watch them struggle to cover the horror , while trying to remain professionally detached  
however , they are human and question the reason behind it all , why no one cares , and how they can get out  
stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson  
he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events  
dillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy  
henderson realizes that he cannot save the world , but he can help a few  
it is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis leary-sandra bullock disaster two if by sea  
woody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest , most versatile actors of his generation  
harrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the character's caring nature and vulnerability shine through  
harrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men ( cheers , white men can't jump ) as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one  
this ability will serve him well and give him a long , successful career  
america's involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place  
for those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict , the entire movie , most importantly the opening scenes , provide a history lesson  
war is a foreign concept to most of us in america  
battles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to  
televised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war "
1,"mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence  ) 
with three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest "" hot properties "" in action adventure stardom , and it's just about time  
for over twenty-five years , jackie's been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy  
 "" drunken master "" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to "" make it big "" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong  
i'm not entirely sure why , exactly  
in many ways , "" drunken master "" is similar to most of jackie's other early films , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii , "" master with cracked fingers "" , "" half a loaf of kung fu "" , "" spiritual kung fu "" , and others  
in fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories  
to be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste  
they're quite different from action movies as we know them in america  
these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together  
 "" drunken master "" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception  
 ( as an aside , "" drunken master "" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen    in 
a movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival  
at the time , i didn't really think it was anything special    but 
after having seen more films like it , it's kind of grown on me  ) 
 "" drunken master "" 's storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii and "" master with cracked fingers "" --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been "" adapted , "" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid )  
more specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka "" naughty panther , "" a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough  
after embarrassing his instructor's assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can    and 
is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively  
his father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages  
kei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all  
while escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more  
this turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu  
he assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up  
then , when he's ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu  
unfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them    
 "" drunken master "" features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others  
it's been said before , but i'll say it again--these fights don't just _happen_ , they're as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows  
in his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways  
the fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films  
whether jackie wins or loses , it's really something to see    and 
it's often as funny as anything , too  
and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at  
there's very little that's new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training    these 
schticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties  
but they're still hilarious as ever  
likewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they're often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own  
the really big thing about "" drunken master "" , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu  
i'm not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security "

1,"countries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously , had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally  
luckily , movie reviewers aren't burdened with such legislation  
otherwise , small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer  
in case of star wars , 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas , the consequences would be even more severe , because that film is very special for tens of millions , if not hundreds of millions of fans  
in any case , objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews , because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best , if not the best film of all times  
those who don't usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery  
the author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold , objective standards in reviewing this film  
like so many previous reviewers , i must note that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago , and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever since  
perhaps it was childlike fascination with , until then unimaginable , wonders that happened long time ago , in a galaxy far away  
or perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the opening shots , with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation i had read before  
anyway , watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life  
and it was also unmatched for many years to come , because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas' epic  
star wars wasn't just important movie for me ( or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment )  
it was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema  
until than , american motion picture industry was in a limbo ; social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood , and new authors filled the void , mostly by using hollywood's financial and technical resources to create serious , "" personal "" or "" artsy "" movies  
as a result , audience , traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate , didn't want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen  
george lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue  
the audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm , and huge financial success of the movie , later backed by supplement industry of toys , books , comics , role playing games and other merchandise , slowly began to change the face of hollywood  
serious , adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion , and were replaced by industrial products of "" blockbuster "" philosophy  
one of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre  
until 1977 , science fiction movies were mostly in b-production domain  
in late 1960s , bigger budgets for science fiction didn't look so strange anymore , thanks to the great success of 2001 : a space odyssey  
but the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism , and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production - mostly dark , dystopic movies  
however , in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies , even among the audience that usually doesn't like it  
as a result , seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away , although some good , dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s  
after that , science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment  
ironically , the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of "" new hollywood "" generation of young movie authors who made "" artsy "" and "" personal "" films in early 1970s  
george lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 , and nostalgic drama american graffiti  
both movies were considered "" personal "" in its time , despite latter one becoming very popular  
in a sense , star wars is an also very "" personal "" film , and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it , not for it  
but unlike many "" personal "" movies of the era , its "" personality "" was in line with the wishes of the general audience  
the plot , set "" a long time ago , in a galaxy far away "" , begins in a time of civil war  
the evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic  
in order to quash any opposition , the empire had built death star , superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets  
the information about death star , acquired by rebel intelligence , is being transported by princess leia organa ( carrie fisher ) when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser  
princess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader ( played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones ) , but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots - c3po ( anthony daniels ) and r2d2 ( kenny baker )  
those two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot  
his adventure begins when r2d2 escapes , because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi ( alec guiness )  
old man is actually the last surviving jedi knight , member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force  
after some hesitation , luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess , while the old man would teach him the ways of the force  
their small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely , where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo ( harrison ford ) and his furry sidekick chewbacca ( peter mayhew )  
critics who don't like the movie , especially those who can't forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of "" new hollywood "" , are prone to point the lack of originality  
on the surface , they might be right ; lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood - westerns , wwii aviation movies , old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s ; yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa's samurai classic the hidden fortress  
on the other hand , those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further - into collective subconscious of western civilisation ( hinted by some mild tolkien references )  
the others would find the author's element within the story - star wars could be seen as an anti- establishment film ; young , long-haired , easy going , nature-loving heroes are fighting against old , uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes  
even out of its historical or social context , star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art  
george lucas' direction is very good , with the clever editing and a well-paced segments between action and dramatic buildup  
characters are well-drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients , both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster  
we have a "" coming-of-age "" hero , damsel-in-distress ( somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time ) , reluctant helper , benevolent mentor , diabolical villain and , finally , comic relief in form of two non-human characters  
some of the actors are very good - alec guiness in his most famous role to date , james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease , peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form  
unfortunately , the same can't be said for the main leads - among the main trio of mark hamill , carrie fisher and harrison ford , only the last one had the character three-dimensional enough to launch his further acting career "

1,"the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam  
 ( fitting , since the media-saturated gulf war became a pop entertainment  ) 
while driving through a long , flat iraqi desert ( in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament ) , one of the men under special forces sgt  
maj  archie gates' ( who's steering ) command requests a beach boys tune  
these men want their apocalypse now moment , only instead of surfing , they bop to the music and skeet shoot out the back of the vehicle , armed with automatic rifles  
our three kings ( okay , four ) are good fighters , but they don't necessarily take operation desert storm seriously-it's a reprieve from their hellish day jobs  
they are gates , new father sgt  
troy barlow ( wahlberg ) , sgt  
chief elgin ( cube ) , and pvt  
conrad vig ( music video director jonze )  
at story's start , president bush has declared a ceasefire , and american troops are tying up loose ends  
barlow , elgin , and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an "" ass-map "" that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion  
gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation ; he proposes-demands-that barlow , elgin , and vig join him on a treasure hunt  
ditching his escort , a relentless reporter named adriana cruz ( nora dunn ) , is easy  
so is finding the treasure , until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq : saddam's men are threatening the dictator's detractors ( citizens of his own country ) with violence  
when gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck , ready to loot , the unarmed rebels want help  
 ( bush encouraged them to rise up against the government , but provided no military support for such cause  ) 
gates convinces the vault's guards that this is a post-war mission , and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck  
the situation could go off without a hitch : the former enemies bear no grudges  
but the money hungry gates has a conscience , and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene , he orders barlow , elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces  
the result : barlow is kidnapped , and the filmmakers imply that these would-be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime  
barlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking device  
his interrogator lost his family to the bombs , and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child  
 ( he does , in chilling , lasting images  ) 
i liked these scenes best , because the political became personal  
it's one thing to champion the plight of thousands ; it's another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib  
russell has shocked us before : his first film , spanking the monkey , is about a young man's affair with his bedridden mother  
 ( it's great  ) 
his second , flirting with disaster , features a character who has an armpit fetish  
one could argue that it's easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions , though ; russell disturbs us in three kings by being no-nonsense about the violence  
when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home , russell mutes the sound-we're paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast  
three kings is russell's first visually arresting picture  
stylistically , it stands apart from other war dramas  
newton thomas sigel's cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy , which is , of course , entirely appropriate  
one practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen  
 ( a friend enthusiastically added , "" it's like having sand in your eyes  "" ) 
this also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade  
 ( three kings was shot in arizona , california , and mexico  ) 
russell throws plenty at sigel's camera for it to observe-as was the case with russell's previous efforts , the most absurd moments are also the film's most realistic , even the most poignant  
 ( we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside  ) 
if anything , three kings settles down and stops surprising us  
its climax is pure hollywood , no doubt the answer to why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indie-minded russell  
subsequently , the characters become more cartoonish-barlow's post-torture revelry felt phony , and chief , a strong presence in the first third , fails to escape the god-fearing-ultra-serious-anti-racist-black-man-of-power clich ? -so much for cube avoiding token status  
 ( the arab players , on the other hand , duck stereotype  ) 
clooney , too , transforms into a blandly heroic protestor-marching with the rebels , i waited for him to shout , "" let my people go ! "" 
hayseed vig notwithstanding , the protagonists are very intelligent , and self-serving , too ; i had a glimmer of hope , based on russell's filmography , that our antiheroes would revert to their greedy selves at some juncture  
 ( it's not spoiling much to write that  ) 
then again , what historical importance would such nastiness serve ? 
 ( there's already enough cynicism in the film's mentioning of kuwait's oil-infested waters  ) 
russell offers the masses a primer on the oft-dismissed gulf conflict , and pulled off a neat trick : a war tale full of battles that takes place after a truce has been declared  
if he set out to make something socially/culturally/politically/globally significant , he succeeded  
with flair "

1,"alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters  
i saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i didn't like it  
of course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault  
in order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor  
james cameron's aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series  
i am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality  
many thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action  
both are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well-written  
as for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion  
perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped  
on the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn't see  
it was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh  
i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities  
don't get me wrong--i'm not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting  
however , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters  
as a result , alien 3's only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters  
we never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie  
there were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt  ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films  
the other character was dr  clemens ( charles dance ) , but because we like him , the inevitable occurs  
alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off  
the prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry  
without using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film  
an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card  
we see lt  ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments    
 ( title )    
a shot of an alien egg    
 ( title )    
alien legs stretch up into the air    
 ( title )    
and so on and so on  
during these first ten minutes , i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed  
it's quite a remarkable opening , and one which will remain in my mind for a long time  
because of this face-hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens , the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod , and sent down to the nearest planet : fiorina fury-161 , an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison  
however , the face-hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo-tubes , and is sent down with the escape pod  
unfortunately , during the landing , all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed  
ripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery "

1,"if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it's their predictable endings  
the devil's advocate has the atypical hollywood ending , when everything that should happen does  
unfortunately for the devil's advocate , this ending nearly collapses in on itself , and ruins the entire film  
nevertheless , the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment ( note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film )  
i don't think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan  
well , it does contain this element , but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that )  
the devil's advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session  
kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl  
he ends up with a not-guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo )  
he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury  
he accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife  
after proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer  
he graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god  
he is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck  
his life seems to be on the rise  
and of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline  
he is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment  
mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted  
meanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t  nelson ) who apparently murdered three people  
he spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane  
all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself  
after a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin's wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends  
a fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin's real father  
is it all just a big nightmare ? 
or is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin's life ? 
the devil's advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don't expect  
is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ? 
if so , the devil's advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early  
i went into the devil's advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got  
i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got  
but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn't like the ending ? )  
the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you  
films like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less  
we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way  
the devil's advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all  
if that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again  
as for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study  
the film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that )  
and then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur  
it was at this point that i felt cheated  
taking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film  
everything occurs from his perspective  
he is our representation on screen ( sort of )  
but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game  
i don't want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself  
perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil's advocate is the extreme amount of everything  
it earned its r rating for a reason  
there is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity  
this film really isn't subtle about anything , showing us everything  
it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh  
however , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those  
i don't condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it  
the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch "

1,"there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have , but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason  
 "" good will hunting "" is about one of those people  
the will hunting of the ( horrible ) title ( let's face it , this film would be a bitch to title ) , played by co-writer matt damon , is a mathematical genius  
he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino  
and he works at mit    as the janitor  
one day , the professor of one of the most challenging courses , proffessor lambeau ( "" breaking the waves "" 's stellan skarsg ? rd ) , puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete  
the next day , it's already done on the board , but no one in his class claims to have done it  
so lambeau puts another problem on the board , this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove  
and , duh , it's done again  
of course , they catch the guy who did it red handed - will  
before lambeau can find will again ( he ran away when he caught him ) , will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court , and struck a police officer , so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements : a ) he work with him on math , and b ) he get some therapy  
after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another ( for a hypnotist , he fakes being under his spell , then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic , "" afternoon delight "" )  
finally , lambeau's old college roomate , sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , a psych professor , agrees to treat him , and the two begin a rocky relationship , as sean tries to get will to open up  
turns out will had a rough childhood , being abandoned , and placed in foster homes and what not  
it also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life ; he wants a challenge  
and that is to hang out with his buds ( including the other co-writer , ben affleck ) , and do honorable jobs , like construction  
is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky ? 
should this guy be forced to do something he doesn't want to do ? 
this appears to be one of the million questions in this film , which is jam-packed with greatness , but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should  
i'm not saying "" good will hunting "" is a bad film at all  
it's a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments , and lots of great things about it  
the acting is amazing , with two oscar-nomination-worthy performances from damon and williams , who have amazing chemistry together  
we also get some great support from stellan skarsg ? rd ( great name ) , ben affleck , and from minnie driver , who plays will's love interest , skylar  
there are tons of individual moments that i adored  
i loved all the comedy in the film , especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks , his various attempts at therapy , and of course , my favorite scene in the entire film , the one where he delivers a long , exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them  
i liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends  
there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch  
and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable  
like the break-up scene between will and skylar , will and sean's first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn't regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter  
however , the main flaw of the film is there's too much of everything , and not enough of it either  
the film tries for deeper relations between the characters , but they're sometimes either overwritten or underwritten  
take for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father/son as well as doctor/patient relationship going with out any problems , but when it tries to show them as equals , it falls on its face  
we hear how they went to the same town , and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times  
but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do  
also , will's relationship with his best friend , chuckie ( affleck ) , has a nice climax , but not enough rising action  
we see them joking around , but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them , it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one  
their relationship never goes beyond "" just best friends , "" and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more    human  
maybe it was just me  
and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau , but that , again , is underwritten  
and , of course , as in most films like this , the girl/boy relationship is pretty underwritten  
we never understand what they see in each other , so when skylar confesses that she loves him , it seems more like it's there for plot details that anything else  
minnie driver is interesting , though , and breathes life into her character  
the writing is a bit at fault here , but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness  
sure , it feels overstuffed , but it's extremely enjoyable  
the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh , and seems extremely human  
i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue , which is amazing  
while this is probably director gus van sant's most conservative film ( you'd hardly know it's the same director of "" to die for , "" the only van sant film i've seen , really ) , it's still a pretty remarkable film , albeit a tad overrated ( what's this "" best picture "" deal ? ) "

1," "" say , any of you know how to madison ? "" 
--- brad "" asshole "" majors ( barry bostwick ) shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show  
the story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend  
in the early 70's , stage actor turned first-time playwright richard o'brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b-movies he had grown up with as a child , set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design  
the result was the stage play the rocky horror show , which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england  
the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later , in october of 1974  
the film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975    
and immediately tanked at the box office  
whether it was because fox wasn't quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn't quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop  
it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters  
a year later , something entirely strange and magical happened  
prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film  
this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time  
word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show's life as the ultimate cult film was born  
for the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton  
brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed  
they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr  everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home  
remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance  
the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet-stocking wearing mad scientist dr  frank-n-furter ( tim curry )  
frank-n-furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood )  
as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank-n-furter's mad schemes  
little do any of them know that the doctor's handyman , riff-raff ( original author richard o'brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth  
going back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has  
if i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i don't think i would have known what to make of it either  
for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film  
by the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o'brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b-movies his film is based on  
when i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity  
it goes without saying that the "" time warp "" is the most popular song in the film  
even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song  
what those who haven't seen the movie don't know though , is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment  
my personal favorite is "" over at the frankenstein place "" , but "" dammit janet "" is also maddeningly catchy  
tim curry's vocals on the rocking tune "" sweet transvestite "" need to be heard to be believed  
the finale of the film , a big floor show staged by frank-n-furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets ( including barry bostwick    
frightening ! ) , features no less than four songs ( "" rose tint my world "" , "" don't dream it "" , "" wild and untamed thing "" , and "" i'm going home "" ) , all of which are immensely singable  
the film's true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though  
despite the catchiness of the songs , this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn't have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show  
watching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans ( unless you don't mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place )  
note : director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film , in the form of a sequel , resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment , which picks up with brad and janet ( this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper ! ) as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton  
the two are menaced by the evil tv station manager ( also played by de young ) , who wishes to claim janet as his own  
o'brien returned as a writer/performer on the project ( as did quinn , campbell , and gray in performance capacity only ) , but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original  
25 years later , this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world  
as a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans , a brand new special edition 2-disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date ( even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary )  
if you are one of those people who can't get enough of the film , this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites  
in an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film , fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2-disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it'll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all  
the film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1  85 : 1 ( enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) "

1,"i know that "" funnest "" isn't a word  
 "" fun "" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective  
but that's the word that came to me right after viewing "" chicken run  "" 
no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like "" that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! "" 
so to hell with webster's -- "" chicken run "" is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while  
i can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner  
the chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something  
living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box  
one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer  
rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs  tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan  
she orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , "" chickens go in ; pies come out  "" 
what sort of pies ? 
chicken pies , of course  
co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : "" creature comforts , "" "" the wrong trousers , "" and "" a close shave  "" 
the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures  
part of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new  
 "" the wrong trousers , "" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and "" a close shave "" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories  
but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived  
now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in "" chicken run  "" 
the plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement  
thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done  
part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? 
park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is  
but they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us  
another thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing  
there are references to "" the great escape , "" obviously , and "" stalag 17  "" 
the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both "" raiders of the lost ark "" and "" indiana jones and the temple of doom  "" 
there's even a nod to "" the blues brothers , "" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history  
the "" braveheart "" reference is a hoot if you catch it  
when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , "" chicken run "" is downright brilliant in its execution  
consider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of "" blair witch project "" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online  
out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome  
why ? 
because once you got past the thought that "" they're parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch' movie , "" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose  
they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing  
conversely , "" chicken run "" doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene  
if you've never seen "" indiana jones , "" the chase sequence is still fun  
even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character  
park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , "" chicken run "" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either  
enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , "" chicken run "" is that much richer  
the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them  
ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on "" absolutely fabulous "" ) nails it  
she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer  
the characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived , but sweet  
poor mr  tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help  
jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence  
they even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs  egg dilemma  
one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of "" chicken run , "" it comes as a delightful surprise  
the film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens  
the animation is first-rate  
remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable "" chicken run "" really is  
this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail "

1,"written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes ) 
directed by robert altman 
some time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel  
the novel was a summer smash , topping best-seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads  
the only problem : the novel wasn't very good  
it was far more pulp than pulitzer  
but the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller  
so he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen  
the director ? 
francis ford coppola  
the book , of course , was mario puzo's the godfather  
the rest , as they say in showbiz , was history  
by bringing up the godfather , i don't mean to suggest that robert altman's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness  
but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material  
can you get any more questionable than john grisham ? 
depends on whom you ask  
but there's no question that grisham's work grabs people  
like puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can of spam  
so something in grisham's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america's greatest living filmmakers  
the result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon  
>from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe  
this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch  
witness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear  
we roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone  
right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises  
pay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman  
this is what a great director can do for questionable source material  
the sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases  
magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office  
outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen  
driven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home  
there he learns more about mallory's life than he bargained for  
her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski-style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter  
magruder , perhaps influenced by mallory's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed - right after he sleeps with her , of course  
this simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end  
he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well  
but then dixon's crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger  
the cops won't lift a finger to help a liberal attorney  
his only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private-eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr )  
if this predicament wasn't bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos  
altman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh's performance holds the gingerbread man together  
an accomplished actor when he isn't directing himself in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives  
is his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness , or of egotism ? 
magruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it's too late  
as the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are  
and life is never so bad that it can't get worse  
if you're familiar with altman's work , you'll recognize several of his signature techniques  
characters are not introduced in establishing shots , but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent  
crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows , making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action  
dialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style  
and of course there's my favorite altman technique - the obligatory nude actress shot  
thanks to altman , here are some of the actresses i've had the pleasure of seeing naked : sally kellerman , julianne moore , madeline stowe , even frances mcdormand  
and now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether  
the naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film  
is it old-school sexism , or a clever in-joke ? 
you be the judge  
but back to the picture at hand "

1,"i was born in 1970 , which makes me barely old enough to remember bell buttons , 8 tracks and disco  
however , since i was 17 years old i've seen more than my share of adult films  
i mention this only because i thinks its important to state up front that i'm not against pornogrpahy  
i've seen enough of these films to know the range of content and quality available  
director paul thomas anderson's boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema , the mid to late 70s  
this was the period when x-rated movies were real movies , shot on film , shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics  
this was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films , films that attempted to tell a real story  
one of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how , like in an any other billion dollar industry , the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete  
in this case , the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette  
burt reynold's manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur , known as jack horner  
horner's has a steady "" family "" of performers , some of whom live in his plush l  a  home  
but in the world of porn , performers are a commodity - the fresher , the better  
when horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque , he decides to add him to his stable  
it is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his  
as directed by anderson , the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door  
boogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l  a  's hardcore film scene  
but the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends  
the downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut  
by the film's final image , what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams  
boogie nights is not about sex  
it does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers  
in fact , the film isn't really about pornography at all  
pornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own sub-culture to find acceptance of who they are  
the film goes to brilliant , often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world  
yet , like in the lauded tarantino films , these people still have their own moral code , their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively  
the characters we meet are like a road map of dysfuntion  
first stop , the den mother ( julianne moore ) in denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody of her son  
second stop , the cuckold crewman ( william h  macy ) who keeps discovering his wife having sex with anyone and everyone ( the wife is played in hilarious cameos by real-life porn star nina hartley )  
but the driving force behind the plot is 17 year old eddie adams  
eddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it  
with no real ambition of his own , he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame  
his alcoholic mother , clearly dissatisfied with her own lot , abuses him verbally and drives him out of the house  
horner introduces him to amber waves ( moore ) who immediately adopts him , a nuclear family is born  
the surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her "" babies "" provides some of the films most poignant scenes  
clearly , she is not even fit to manage her own life , let alone nurture these lost children  
but the need to love and be loved is so strong , they easily ignore the dangers of the less subtle addiction she introduces them to  
even the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in a real family  
then again , perhaps its not so different from real families at all  
eddie adams , who later takes on the screen name "" dirk diggler "" , is skillfully acted by former pop-star , mark wahlberg  
i say "" former "" pop star because with this performance wahlberg can officially quit his day job  
this is bold and brave territory for such a young man  
he pulls it off marvelously  
wahlberg is a "" big , bright star "" with a big bright future  
boogie nights plays very much in the spirit of the people versus larry flynt , without the first amendment preachiness  
its intimate studies of character make it the superior film  
wahlberg's surprising performance is on par with woody harrelson's "

1,"what if one of our cities became the target for terror ? 
what can we do ? 
what can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism ? 
what basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice to prevent another oklahoma city disaster ? 
so far america has been the leading nation , opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world  
it is the land of opportunities  
it is the land of freedom  
but what if it became the new target ? 
this dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding in reality  
when a special branch of the united states military , under the command of general william devereaux ( bruce willis ) , takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal , islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice  
the only warning the fbi receives is a single , cryptic message : "" release him  "" 
then all hell breaks loose in new york  
a bus is destroyed , killing 25 civilians  
a broadway theater is bombed  
hostages are taken at a school  
as the wave of terrorist activity crests , the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law  
devereaux argues against that eventuality , but is nevertheless ready to lead 10 , 000 men into action on american soil  
another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities  
his staff is comprised of smart , energetic , intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group o ! 
f moronic feds we're used to seeing in movies  
hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , whose department knows more about the situation than they're willing to reveal  
but the attacks escalate  
the fbi are helpless , chasing an invisible enemy  
the land is under siege  
they have lost control   a 
terror is coming from within   
what's great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror to life  
it reflects reality  
and that's why it makes such an impact  
edward zwick has created a clever , well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season  
the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously  
and so his film plays on several levels , never loosing focus on its main objective  
he is exploring the abuse of power , the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u  s  government ( the army , the fbi , and the cia )  
he takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved  
the palestinian community in 1998 new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii  
there are concentration camps and unlawful interments , all in the name of the "" greater good  "" 
in the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul -- freedom  
was that what the terror ! 
ists really wanted ? 
this film has evoked protests and objections from the arab-american population in the u  s  and n  y  especially  
but to me these protests seem unnecessary  
zwick is careful to not step over the line and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys  
the script is therefore wonderfully balanced  
agent hubbard's best friend and loyal colleague frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) is lebanese-american  
and it is quite often you hear lines such as "" my first boyfriend was palestinian  
they seduce you with their suffering "" or "" they love this country as much as we do  "" 
but no matter how you twist this matter , you won't get away from the fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arab-speaking population who are in the great majority  
more to the point , the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arab-americans by the u  s  military  
and thus this film does not serve as a source for discrimination in any !

1,"quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers  
after his pulp fiction , many actors began receiving many offers for jobs  
john travolta made his come-back and is now one of today's most bankable stars  
bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor  
jackie brown , on the other hand , boasts quite a well known cast , except for the main lead : pam grier  
most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films , but she's never really had a breakthrough performance ( her first film was in the roger ebert-written beyond the valley of the dolls )  
that is , until now  
jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino , whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction  
after mediocre acting jobs , tarantino returns to what made his name a household one : directing and writing  
jackie brown is the result , and it is fantastic entertainment  
despite excellent direction from tarantino , the cast steals the film , giving one good performance after another  
pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown , and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent--samuel l  jackson , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , and robert forster  
more than likely , you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations  
describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult , as you really can't say much or you spoil it for everyone else  
i will tread lightly  
jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport  
the camera tracks along with her , and ends up revealing her occupation  
we are also introduced to ordell robbie ( jackson ) , who sells illegal guns to interested buyers    
for a hefty price  
ms  brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away  
however , an fbi agent ( keaton ) and a local l  a  cop ( michael bowen ) are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money  
they try to reach him through beaumont livingston ( chris tucker ) , one of ordell's buyers , but he mysteriously ends up dead  
they try again through brown , but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong-doing  
but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell's friends ( fonda ) , she is caught and sent to jail  
ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent , max cherry ( forster ) , and then wants to find out what she told the cops  
after she claims to have said nothing , she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison  
ordell doesn't like this , but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track  
this scheme seems to be going as planned , but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal  
revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown , and that's the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film  
tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments ( and slang terms ) , but they are always done very well and believably  
his hitmen are normally cruel , but pleasant , in that nasty sort of way  
they talk like normal people , except for when doing business , and they are rude to their girlfriends  
of course , this is a tarantino film , and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise  
and perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop  
of course , tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film , adding a lot of his reservoir dogs-style storytelling to it  
things are told from one person's perspective , and then from another , and then from another , each time learning more and more  
this all leads up to a very interesting conclusion , which decides who is on whose side  
on the technical side of jackie brown , quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film  
however , this time around it isn't as nearly as impressive or original  
the writing , on the other hand , is quite good , although i do find tarantino's use of slang terms offensive  
the story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction , but it's much more easy to understand  
his previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation , but jackie brown is very simply to follow , especially considering that the time is given during the "" leaps "" in time  
perhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel "" rum punch "" by elmore leonard  
the dialogue is pretty much intelligent , and all the characters are fully realized  
the cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro ( who has worked with tarantino on previous films ) and the editing is very good "

1,"the premise of the new teen-targeted horror film `final destination' causes a recollection of a memorable `simpsons' halloween episode  
after attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster , lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable time-machine  
after a trek into the cretaceous period , homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world  
again and again , homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it  
the characters of `final destination' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence - their `design'  
someone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake  
that someone is death  
you see , alex browning ( devon sawa ) and six others have cheated the grim reaper     
but the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve  
for a high school excursion , alex's french class is traveling to paris by airline transport  
alex , tense and neurotic , has a shocking premonition after boarding : he sees the plane , and every passenger on it , spontaneously explode in mid-air  
in a panic of sheer lunacy , alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft  
after a handful of others ( including one teacher ) follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane , the unwitting ? survivors' watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky  
the loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize  
but death won't be cheated so easily , and one by one , the survivors of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances  
the grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi  
before i delve into the meat of the review , i'd just like to confer     
is that one helluva premise , or what ? 
`final destination' , creepy beyond rational comprehension , probably reads more like an unsettling `x-files' episode than `the simpsons' - therefore , the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong  
on familiar turf , the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong , and the opening 20 minutes of `final destination' reflects that  
unlike most thrillers , the set-up is crisp and cool  
you just deeply , sincerely hope that the momentum won't unspool , leaving us with a second-string effort with nothing but cheap , derivative shocks  
young viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration , what with `i know what you did last summer' and sequel , `idle hands' and -- a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil -- `urban legend'  
after the set-up , when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair , i started to really have fun with `final destination'  
low and behold , a teen thriller that is actually unsettling , actually suspenseful and -- yes -- actually intelligent  
some splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside , this film is among the most refreshing and all-out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting-edge `scream' in 1996  
`final destination' stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood-spattered slasher crap we've endured throughout the past few years  
not that the characters are that good  
sawa is game as alex , a connect-the-dots personality that we never fully comprehend  
in addition , the survivors are endearing geek tod ( chad e  donella ) , jocky control-freak carter ( kerr smith of `dawson's creek' ) , carter's ditzy girlfriend terry ( amanda detmer ) , the none-too-subtly named billy hitchcock ( seann william scott , supplier of lukewarm comic relief ) and a lone teacher - the emotionally delicate ms  lewton ( kristin cloke )  
aside from alex , the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter ( `varsity blues' ) , playing an abstract character named clear rivers ( what were her parents thinking ? ! ? )  
the personality of clear is written with such a vague , nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flash-card saying `hello , i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main character's plight ! ' 
toss a few stereotypical fbi agents ( daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith ) and a     ummm    
`spiritual' mortician ( former `candyman' tony todd ) into the mix , and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing , dicing and assorted disembowelments  
not so  
`final destination' has no slicing and dicing , or at least none dealt by a human killer , and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique and frightening  
the extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying ? murderer-on-the-loose' concept , with assistance from a shrewd , intelligently paced screenplay by morgan , wong and jeffrey reddick  
the plot twists are fun and clever without toppling into utter absurdity ( listen up , `reindeer games' )  
but i suppose the most satisfying aspect of `final destination' is the murder scenes "

1,"star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) 
review by matt pusateri 
few movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas' 1977 classic , star wars  
the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture  
arguably , more americans today can explain what "" the force "" or a "" jedi "" is than a budget deficit or a serb  
so 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? 
can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? 
against this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week  
and despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment  
while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking  
it is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films  
the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films  
as the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson )  
the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation  
the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo's young queen amidala ( natalie portman )  
later , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice  
on tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts  
qui-gon senses the child is "" unusually strong "" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be "" the one "" prophesized to "" bring balance to the force  "" 
as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader  
complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala  
while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul  
if the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is  
the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin's turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy  
but the complexity is not overwhelming  
the story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode  
one of the reasons the film's story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused  
it's unclear whose story phantom menace is  
in the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke's story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight  
but it's unclear whether this new film is anakin's story or obi-wan's  
if this trilogy is centered on anakin , it's a shaky foundation  
lloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive  
on screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is "" the one  "" 
the rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas  
neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight  
mcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility  
portman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality  
the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them  
individually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series  
but unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn't do as good of a job playing the characters off one another  
in star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke  
the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities  
in the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other  
there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other  
individually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them  
this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers  
but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging  
many of the wonderful elements of lucas' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining  
first , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates  
the characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing "" destroyers "" on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council  
each location is elaborate and complex  
lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines  
most of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren't possible when the films were made  
more than ever , in this new film , lucas' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters  
the best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves  
watto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room "

1,"natural born killers is really a very simple story that , in essence , has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis , mood and degree  
both films glamorize "" outlaws , "" in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers  
both relate the story of a couple liberated by love  
but where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle , natural born killers is total and blatant  
where bonnie & clyde was social , natural born killers is psychological  
what bonnie & clyde hinted at , natural born killers confronts and explores  
what bonnie and clyde stole , mickey and mallory kill  
to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them , expressed metaphorically as killing , subdues the mysterious power this film wields  
for the most part , when mickey and mallory kill , they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily , they kill what is trying to kill them , they kill what dissembles and cowers from life , they kill what needs to be killed  
this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity  
brahma created  
vishnu preserved  
and siva destroyed , but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma  
the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate , i'm forced to say it for clarity's sake : a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes , that is , destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics  
your plumber , bonnie and clyde , mickey and mallory , and siva are all productive destroyers  
i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death , presently and historically , than any other phenomena  
muslims kill christians  
hindus kill muslims  
christians kill pagans  
jews kill christians , etc  you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged  
religion is an orgy of killing  
the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn't been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable  
 "" the state is the divine idea upon earth , "" hegel said , meaning it is absolute , all-powerful , ineffable , unassailable , infallible , authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh , allah , god , etc  
well , what does all this have to do with natural born killers ? 
let me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex  
consider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever  
god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc  they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other  
during the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power  
 ( parenthetically , witness plato as well  
in the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime  
not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions  ) 
catholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil  
it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure  
masturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution  
this is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence  
as further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters  
our culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years  
we can't help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self  
mickey and mallory knox internalized them , too , then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other , discovered them , and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves  
it is a straightforward liberation through sex  
as some good patriarch once observed , "" you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on  "" 
m&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions  
they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions  
 "" the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers , "" as mickey says  
as a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter : let us look each other in the face  
we are hyberboreans--we know well enough how remote our place is  
 "" neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans "" : even pindar , in his day , knew that much about us  
beyond the north , beyond ice , beyond death--our life , our happiness   "

1,"synopsis : captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of 600 , the ba'ku , from the evil admiral dougherty and ru'afro  
the enterprise crew , in the meantime , experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba'ku homeworld : lt  worf grows a pimple , data sings opera pieces , picard scores with a ba'ku chick , riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi , and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts  
comments : "" star trek : the next generation "" was a hugely successful sequel tv series to "" star trek , "" a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s  
even though it still enjoyed high ratings , "" star trek : the next generation "" ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original "" star trek "" 's cast in paramount's film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise  
star trek : insurrection is the ninth "" star trek "" movie and the third to focus on the "" star trek : the next generation "" crew  
star trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans , such as myself , would rate somewhere between "" okay "" and "" good  "" 
after star trek v : the final frontier , a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant "" star trek : voyager "" tv series , "" star trek "" fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise  
i don't wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies  
most people reading this probably haven't followed "" star trek "" anyway , so a comparison would seem tedious at best  
let me , thus , make my comparisons briefly so that it's out of my system : star trek : insurrection is not as good as the previous installment , star trek : first contact ; star trek : insurrection's comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv : the voyage home ; star trek ii : the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie  
okay  let's move to the movie itself  
star trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise , humanity's exploration and colonization of space , with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners  
this combination works well more often than it fails , but when it does fail , the humor really seems cheesy  
much of this film appeals to trek fans' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise's crew  
audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times  
star trek : insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba'ku homeworld  
forget the actors and special effects , the beautiful setting of this movie , with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys , steals the show  
this tranquility , however , is broken by data , an android , who reveals to the ba'ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies , the son'a  
it seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth , sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young , healthy state  
the enterprise crew , led by captain picard , investigates data's actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the son'a and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba'ku and plunder the planet's youth-restoring properties  
sound pretty heavy ? 
it is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film's constant barrage of humor  
when going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous )  
in a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba'ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , cannot avoid looking at  
the acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good  
since they've been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough  
the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean-luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard's trademark , with his usual aplomb  
brent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android-wishing-to-be-human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series )  
the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good  
despite many other critics' negative opinions , f  murray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru'afro well enough  
ru'afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune  
like the baron , ru'afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants  
in one particularly memorable scene , ru'afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds  
ru'afro is no khan from star trek ii--the best trek villain ever--but he is much better than the forgettable dr  soran from star trek : generations  
 ( okay , i promise , no more comparisons  ) 
donna murphy must also be noted as a ba'ku woman , anij , who picard falls in love with  
murphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance  
this is the type of woman whom picard , for those who know the character well , would be enchanted with  
in fact , the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here  
a particular plot point involving anij's ability to slow time down , an ability which she shares with picard , becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie  
for as good as the actors and setting were , star trek : insurrection's special effects were surprisingly disappointing  
they proved adequate , sometimes barely , for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film , but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars : the phantom menace ( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection )  
the space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships , in particular , seemed trite and unsuspenseful , and the final confrontation between picard and ru'afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite  
the new enterprise itself , only seen in this film and its predecessor , remains largely unexplored , though its exterior doesn't look quite right for a reason i cannot explain  
despite star trek : insurrection's frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects , i enjoyed the film  
it maintains roddenberry's largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors , particularly star trek : first contact ( though , don't get me wrong , the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully )  
i'd recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon , especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general  
rated pg , i can't see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience , young or old "

1,"when i first heard that disney's next animated feature was going to be tarzan , i was almost horrified  
i was worried that disney was going to make another hercules ( sorry , jerk-ules )  
that effort was too overloaded with comedy ( and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero ) , and , after viewing it to this day , i find it a disgrace for disney animation  
when i saw the trailers , i was thinking "" hmm    
this isn't bad at all  
this just might have potential  "" 
when i bought the soundtrack , i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features  
i have never really heard of phil collins , nor have i heard of mark mancina , so i was wondering , how would these two make this disney flick spin ? 
i was pleasantly surprised : the music is top-notch  
phil collins' songs are terrific , percussion-heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs  
the score from mark mancina was also neat ; it reminded me a bit of the lion king , but it was more original  
so , the soundtrack wasn't bad at all , considering it was by two people i am not familiar with  
this film could be good    
but will it be ? 
when i finally went to see it ( on opening day , as i tend to do with most disney animated features ) , my question was answered , in a complete turnabout of expectations for me : disney's tarzan is surprisingly decent  
the story starts out with tarzan's parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace  
however , one day , a vicious leopard , sabor , attacks and kills tarzan's parents , leaving him ( at this time , a baby ) alone-until kala of the apes rescues him  
kala wants to raise the child as her own ( she lost hers previously to sabor ) , but her mate , kerchak is not too sure  
 "" it's not our kind , "" he says  
he agrees , though , to let her take care of little tarzan , but "" that doesn't make him my son  "" 
tarzan grows up , vowing to be "" the best ape ever "" , but no matter how hard he tries or what he does ( at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend , terk ) , he just can't convince kerchak that he is one of the apes , even when he defeats sabor in a battle  
one day , a new animal shows up : humans  
this is where jane comes into the picture  
she is on an expedition with her father ( professor porter ) , and a despicable hunter ( clayton ) searching for gorillas  
tarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons , and soon they get to know each other  
even though tarzan falls in love with jane , this causes things to go wrong  
clayton tricks tarzan into taking him , jane , and porter to see the apes , who are convinced that he has betrayed them  
worse , clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money  
will tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes ? 
i'm not gonna tell you , sorry  
you're gonna have to see for yourself  
and see it you should ; the animation is , as always , top notch , particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees ( read that , skateboarding )  
the deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in  
in fact , it seems similar to the computer imagery/cel animation combination in rival disney animted films , such as fox's anastasia and dreamworks' prince of egypt  
could it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals ? 
the casting is fairly good  
tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan ( and to my relief , the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules  
nicely done ) , and glenn close is wonderful as kala ( she has a beautiful singing voice , too , by the way )  
lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson's beast voice , which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping  
minnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane  
i thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film ( when i first saw the trailers ) , but when i saw the film , i didn't have a problem with her  
i take back my insult on driver  
it's nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature ( he was fflewdurr flamm in disney's most underrated classic , the black cauldron ) ; he is funny and delightful as professor porter  
on the villiany side of the voices , brian blessed ( the guy who did boss nass in star wars : episode i-the phantom menace ) brings a pompous , and later on vicious , voice to the sinister clayton  
he might not be the strongest character in the film ( he's just a plain bad guy , nothing else ) , but blessed's vocal work contributes greatly  
but if there is any voice that i think steals the whole show , it should be rosie o'donnell , who is hilariously funny as terk  
she also has a fiesty attitude ( "" i'm gonna kill ya ! "" 
she says , more than once )  
i almost sung along with her during one of the film's best moments , where the apes make a mess of the human's camp , via song , er , scatting "" shoo-be-doo , da-be-dah ""  
i can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film , she's a good singer  
not that she was the only funny character in the film , though  
wayne knight ( who played stan in space jam ) gives a whimsically funny style to tantor , an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into "" un-sanitary "" water "
1,"on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements ( in case you missed it , warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail  
he says to a black congregation ""    if you can't cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife , you're never gonna get rid of me  "" ) 
well , there is such a plot , and it works very well in this comedy  
beatty plays jay billington bulworth , a long-time democratic senator from california  
the movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth's latest commercials condemning affirmative action  
the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy  
when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv , having gone without food or sleep for days  
his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care  
first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe - a $10 million life insurance policy in his daughter's name  
then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination  
his assistant murphy ( oliver platt ) is oblivious to bulworth's suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements  
bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african-american church , then takes questions from the audience  
he is hit hard with questions about his voting record  
he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots , and it hasn't shown up  
since he's a dead man anyway , he figures he'll answer truthfully : he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l  a  for the photo opportunity  
they made some promises that improved their public image for a while , and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made  
the shock and outrage from the congregation grows , the questions keep coming , and he keeps shooting back honest , if ugly , answers  
 ( before i go further , i'd like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make , and that is that characterizing african-americans as malt-liquor drinking o  j  
fans is not part of bulworth's "" truth  "" 
that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie  
when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics , this line is not what they're talking about  ) 
the experience is liberating  
with nothing left to lose , bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth  
he can say whatever he wants because he's going to be dead anyway  
why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician - that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists , and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism ? 
bulworth's candor wins him three volunteers from the church , one of whom , nikki ( halle barry ) , he gets a crush on  
he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something  
chicken wings , appropriately enough  
bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives  
when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings , bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment  
with so much money and so many talented people working so hard , he wonders , why can't hollywood make a quality product  
 ( you go , warren ! ) 
when they become indignant and ask why he's talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product , he callously admits that it's because they are rich jews  
that night he drops the three african-american volunteers at their nightclub , and he decides to go in with them  
he stays up all night drinking , smoking pot , dancing , falling in love with nikki , and learning to scratch turntables and rap  
the next day , he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit-and-tie fundraisers  
from then on , at all of his political appearances , he raps his political truth  
his rap is not bad for a middle-aged white guy  
he's not very good , but it is his first try and at least he's not embarrassingly bad  
his lobbyists are not amused , but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth  
eventually , the movie's plot ( remember he hired a hit man ? ) 
overtakes the politics , which is too bad  
screen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him  
there are even a few gratuitous chase scenes , bulworth fleeing his killer  
these scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along , but it distracted and detracted from bulworth's political ranting , which was much more interesting than the ever-present , obvious-looking assassin  
still , most of the movie is original and very enjoyable , and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen  
as the story and screen writer , he came up first with a good structure , then with good dialogue to back it up ( jeremy pikser co-wrote the screenplay )  
as an actor , he was able to convincingly portray bulworth's depression , then liberation and rebirth "

1,"confession time : i have never , ever seen gone with the wind  
i don't know why , really  
haven't wanted to check it out on video , haven't been at home the nights it was on network tv , and it was too far to drive the last time it was on the big-screen  
so right up front , i'll admit that i don't know what the heck i'm talking about , but here goes    
is titanic the gone with the wind of the 1990's ? 
maybe that's going a little bit too far  
as good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie , they're no clark gable and vivien leigh  
but    
the parallels are there  
gwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available -- technicolor  
titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors  
gwtw places america's greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story , titanic does the same with the atlantic's most legendary tragedy  
they both have strong-willed redheaded heroines , they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slaves/steerage bums , they were both incredibly expensive and popular    
ok , maybe that's not enough parallels  
so titanic's not in gwtw's league  
no matter  
titanic is a great movie in its own right , complete with spills , thrills and ( especially ) chills  
much has been made of the humongous cost of the production , and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again  
the money was obviously well-spent  
the costumes look great , the sets look great , the cgi graphics look great  
i especially liked the expensive little touches , like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks  
but writer/director/producer james cameron's real challenge in writing/directing/ producing titanic wasn't just costuming and set design and special effects  
cameron's major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in  
he succeeds masterfully  
cameron does two things that work incredibly well  
first , he shows us modern-day salvage operations on titanic ( that's just "" titanic "" , not "" the titanic "" , mind you )  
the first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state , corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic , from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton )  
television coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues 101-year-old rose calvert ( gloria stuart ) , who survived the wreck in 1912  
stuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role , narrating the story of her experience to a stunned paxton and his roughneck crew  
secondly , cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character , and the romantic triangle between rose ( winslet ) , her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley ( billy zane ) and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon ( dicaprio )  
the way that big-budget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an all-star cast , so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people  
cameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack , while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board  
the supporting cast is professional , but mostly anonymous -- other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown , there's no moment when you stop and say , oh , yeah , i know him , what's he been in  
 ( although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform , or even as the ill-fated engineer  ) 
the love story itself is rather conventional  
i think some reviewers found it weak , and that may be a fair criticism  
the performances are the key here  
zane has the meatiest part in the movie , and he plays the arrogant , condescending steel millionaire to the hilt  
he's smooth , he looks great in a tuxedo , and he's a convincing enough jerk that the winslet-dicaprio relationship looks plausible  
at the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat , you can hear the wheels in his mind turning , saying not "" can i save this little girl ? "" , 
but "" can she help me get on a lifeboat ? "" 
dicaprio is a revelation  
i hadn't seen him before in anything , and didn't know what the heck to expect , really  
 ( honestly , i expected a bad irish accent , but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea , so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game  ) 
dicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive , and being on the titanic , that it's hard not to like him  
from the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg , dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest , and he never falters  
winslet's character grows up a lot during the movie , and so does her performance  
at first , she's not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop-dead gorgeous "

1,"glory--starring matthew broderick , denzel washington , and morgan freeman--is the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts , the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war  
broderick plays robert gould shaw , the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle  
shaw , the son of well-to-do abolitionists , hailed from boston high society  
the letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard , and were , evidently , the inspiration for glory  
as the film begins in 1862 , shaw is a captain in the northern forces  
like private eriksson ( michael j  fox ) in casualties of war , shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war--that is , until his company is attacked by enemy forces  
shaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle , witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck  
soon after his recovery , shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort  
glory is the story not only of colonel shaw , but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery  
the film periodically jumps between shaw's point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers  
the movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits , and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action  
the large black cast is uniformly outstanding , especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth  
he is brash and pushy , always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight  
his bitter , tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability  
washington provides much of the film's intensity and emotional power  
in one heartbreaking scene , he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army  
when he removes his shirt to receive the punishment , you cringe at the sight of his back , which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave  
it makes your blood boil  
the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings ; a tear rolls down washington's cheek--and will probably run down your cheek as well  
the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn't deserting the army at all ; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores  
freeman is , as usual , a strong presence , even in a small supporting role  
he plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember  
he quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers , holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers  
colonel shaw recognizes freeman's leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major , making him the first black officer in the army  
andre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles , a free black who is one of shaw's close childhood friends  
searles is educated and refined , like a white man , prompting washington to nickname him "" snow flake  "" 
the burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat  
the road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment  
the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships , but somehow they never lose their morale  
the army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens , subjecting them to racism and discrimination  
they are paid only $10 a month , whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen , and , for a long time , they have to go without shoes , guns , or uniforms  
to make matters worse , the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action , preferring instead to use them for manual labor  
eventually , however , the regiment receives its boots , uniforms , rifles , and right to fight , thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw  
shaw has absolute faith in his soldiers , and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve , even if it means threatening a general with blackmail  
broderick , in fact , is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment  
unfortunately , however , broderick's uneven performance is , in many respects , the weak link in the movie  
in an effort to look more mature , broderick sports a mustache and a goatee , and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent  
he is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced  
the film places too much weight on broderick's character and not enough on the black soldiers , who are more intriguing  
glory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war  
the movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july  
glory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts  
except for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head , the film , for the most part , leaves the gore to your imagination , which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid  
to the contrary , they are chaotic and horrifying ; it's just that director edward zwick ( the co-creator of "" thirtysomething "" ) films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster  
the key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers  
the movie depicts some of ( but not enough of ) their customs and rituals  
in one scene , for example , the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire  
each man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration  
a couple of the movie's most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe , disbelief and pride  
the regiment's greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle , thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner "

1,"seen may 19 , 1999 at 5 p  m  at the crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n  y  ) , theater #1 , with my brother john for $8  50  
[theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats , sound and picture] 
 ( critic's note : this review is the longest i've ever written and still only scratches the surface  
i'd recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis  ) 
as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ? 
never mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old  
never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released  
never mind that there's so much going on in this movie in terms of plot , action , special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn't cover everything  
and also like ted does in all of his reviews , i'll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader  
before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film , many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film , skip this and the next four paragraphs )  
as has been made obvious for the last several years , another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars' series ( the first of the films was actually episode four , not one )  
george lucas , the creator of the series , has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , ' `the empire strikes back' and `return of the jedi' ) is actually the second trilogy , chronologically  
in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can't recall his reasons  
with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err    
second trilogy    
well you know what i mean )  
and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which , unfortunately , may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution  
[critic's note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed , but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule  
critic's note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics' law of reviewing movies , which as roger ebert coined , `it's not what a movie is about , but how it is about it  ' 
because so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story  ] 
first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it  
we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire  
we know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side  ' 
we also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi )  
what we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth  
to me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity  
also , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended  
most notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine  
for those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least )  
with `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights  
unfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained  
i didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness  
if you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? )  
but i digress  
i've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself  
all these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself  
what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s  
its similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality  
the basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times  
we're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo  
we're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly  
we're introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor )  
the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen , amidala ( portman )  
the leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears "
1,"i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video  
it really scared me , and i didn't want to go see it  
however , after i heard about how wonderful it was , i wanted to see it  
i didn't get a chance to do so , until now  
the film , disney's 25th animated feature , opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale : a long time ago in the land of prydain , there was a king so evil , that his spirit was captured in the cauldron  
it has been hidden for centuries , and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors , and with them rule the world ? and destroy it  
then , we meet a farmer-wizard , dallben , and his young apprentice , taran  
taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a `pig-keeper' ( they have a pig named hen-wen )  
one day , as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath , the pig goes crazy , and dallben then realizes , after watching hen wen's thoughts through a bucket of water , that taran must hide hen wen in the forest  
an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron , and only hen wen has the power to show its location  
taran leads hen wen into the forest , but of course , he loses her , and tries to go find her  
along the way , he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi , who desires `munchings and crunchings' , much to his dismay ( besides , he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen )  
when he hears hen wen's squeal from far away , though , he races to her rescue ? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants  
taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king's castle from far away  
taran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen  
he manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon  
there , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls  
along the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie  
the three manage to escape the horned king's castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic  
as they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen's trail  
he leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of `pig tracks' , to a whirlpool  
suddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy-like fairfolk  
taran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva  
he then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world  
with the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage  
it turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place  
when taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ? in exchange for his sword  
taran agrees , much to eilonwy's horror , but at least they get the black cauldron  
but ? the cauldron can't be destroyed , only its evil powers can be stopped  
the only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive  
things take a turn for the worse when the horned king's henchmen capture taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr , along with the black cauldron , and lead them back to the castle  
taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors ( this is the most horrifying scene in the film , because here , a dead army comes alive ? )  
just when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr  
taran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away  
gurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay  
taran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king  
he kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely  
taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king's castle just as it self-destructs  
the witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they `never give anything away , they bargain'  
in response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi  
the trade is made ; gurgi's seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group  
as taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs-he is not dead after all ! 
the happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return  
as spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times  
before ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions , he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron , a sword and sorcery tale for the studio  
bringing this book to the screen was the studio's fondest dream  
miller , who entitled himself as the executive producer , promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects  
when micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio , the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron  
by this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department  
many of the studio's old men had retired or died  
therefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film  
originally budgeted at $25 million , the costs raised to $40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped "

1,"will hunting ( matt damon ) is a natural genius  
for a movie character , that's usually a death sentence  
it's a trait associated with what my brother calls "" too good for this world "" movies , like phenomenon or powder  
forgive me for spoiling the ending , but will doesn't die  
this is no formula movie  
in fact , it's quite fresh and original  
it's a character study more than anything , and that's not surprising , considering it was written by two actors : damon and co-star ben affleck  
will works whatever kind of job he can get  
first he's a janitor , then he works construction  
off-screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him  
on-screen he hangs out with his friends , picking fights in robust , romanticized-hemingway fashion  
lambeau ( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves ) , a math professor , learns that the janitor ( will ) is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics  
having confirmed he's not a fluke or a savant , he does what he can to get will into the education system  
he is firmly rejected  
finally , will lands in jail for one of his fights  
lambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him  
will ( barely ) decides to go for the therapy over prison  
lambeau treats will like a son  
he's proud of , and amazed by , will's accomplishments in mathematics  
he encourages will and tries to give him structure , knowing that , with a little discipline , he could be bigger than einstein  
will isn't really interested in academia  
he knows he would be the best in his field , and therefore spend all of his time in an office , explaining math to people like lambeau  
he would rather work construction , which breaks lambeau's heart  
meanwhile , will attends his mandated therapy sessions  
it's not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau's "" a "" list  
will has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade , and how to keep them from affecting him  
shrink after shrink refuses to return after will's mockery  
lambeau's last hope is his old college roommate , now a psychology teacher at a small-time community college  
knowing that will is going to try to shred him too , sean ( robin williams ) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein  
true to form , will finds sean's emotional weakness and attacks  
but unlike the other shrinks , sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions  
like a foster mother with a fussy child , sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride  
like the foster mother , sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach  
robin williams is excellent in this role  
he's not an actor with a great range , but in the right roles he has great depth  
in this movie , as in awakenings , there comes a point when the quiet , shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance , and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes  
williams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling  
i have compared will to a foster child and that's not entirely fair  
emotionally , he has a lot to learn , but he is not a child  
he has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants  
sean , his girlfriend , his pals , and lambeau all help him grow , but he didn't start out asking for , or particularly needing , help  
his exceptional gift singled him out , and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction  
if i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama  
it's too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama , but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama  
it is emotionally engaging , but it's not quite larger than life  
this isn't a problem per se , but at times i didn't know quite how to take it  
but this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie  
a good movie allows its characters to learn and grow  
it doesn't just happen ; it takes a good script , good acting , and good direction  
good will hunting has all three  
if you are at all inclined to see it , by all means , go "

1,"for example , in happy gilmore , sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self-confident jerk of a pro  
if the star were any other comic , that would be enough motivation to drive the movie , but with sandler , the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house  
that extra motive doesn't make happy gilmore a funnier movie  
it doesn't really add any genuine emotional depth , either  
in fact , the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie  
but sandler's philosophy seems to be , if it's a token gesture , why not make it a nice gesture ? 
that is endlessly refreshing  
in the wedding singer , sandler is right on track  
the fact that he's a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story  
what kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important  
david spade could have filled the role with cynicism and sarcasm  
he could make fun of the fat , ugly , or embarrassing people he meets at weddings , and the story would be intact  
but sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character  
he seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family  
robbie hart ( sandler ) doesn't just sing at weddings ; he also gets the loners to join in and have fun , and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing  
he is exactly the man you would want at your wedding  
the day comes when robbie has his own wedding , and he is stood up by his heavy-metal bride ( the movie is set in 1985 )  
robbie takes it hard  
he doesn't sleep , he doesn't eat , and he gets punched out at work when he sings "" love stinks "" at a wedding  
julia ( drew barrymore ) , who waitresses all the weddings in town , gives him a shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to  
eventually , robbie starts rebounding toward julia  
he really likes her , but she's engaged  
her fianc ? is a self-confident jerk ( do i see a trend - nope , just a formula ) who doesn't deserve her , but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand  
julia seems to like robbie too , but she can't leave her seemingly safe and stable fianc ? for the off-chance that robbie might be serious about her  
you know the story  
you've seen it a million times before  
there's always a new way to tell it , with new lovers , new chemistry , and new details , but it's the same story  
and sometimes , it works  
the wedding singer works  
first of all , the chemistry between sandler and barrymore is effective  
actually , it's not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each one's own romantic tension  
sandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man , struck with an unattainable love  
barrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with  
sparks don't fly when they kiss , but they both seem right for each other  
second , their love is mature  
they are not driven by passionate sexual attraction - they're a cute couple , but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material  
instead , they are both looking for someone meaningful , someone to settle down with , someone to grow old with  
at a wedding , robbie comforts a kid throwing up in a dumpster while julia sits by  
the repulsing situation is taken in stride , as if the two were already parents , caring for their sick child  
the ? 80s soundtrack and references play a big part in this movie  
other critics liked this movie in part because of the '80s soundtrack  
i liked it in spite of the soundtrack  
often , the music and references felt forced  
for example , robbie tells his ex-fianc ? to "" get out of my van halen t-shirt before you jinx the band and they break up  "" 
 ( ha ha ha  
get it ? 
david lee roth did leave van halen ! ) 
or how about when sammy ( allen covert ) , robbie's chauffeur friend , shows up at a party wearing a michael jackson jacket and - get this - a single silver glove  
 ( that's exactly what mj used to wear all the time ! )  
unfortunately , making fun of generalizations about a past era is too easy to be rewarding  
that's not to say the movie isn't funny  
screenwriter tim herlihy has written for sandler before ( billy madison and happy gilmore ) , and the two make a good combination  
herlihy knows what sort of jokes sandler is good at and has tailored the script to his straight-faced , smart-aleck style  
let's hope herlihy and sandler stick together for a few more projects because this movie really won me over "
1,"truman ( "" true-man "" ) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey's character in this film  
president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide , in spite of ( or was it because of ) his stature  
 "" truman "" also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war , an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans  
and burbank , california , brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc  
if hollywood is the center of the film world , burbank is , or was , the center of tv's world , the world where our protagonist lives  
combine all these names and concepts into "" truman burbank , "" and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world  
truman leads the perfect life  
his town , his car , and his wife are picture perfect  
his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky  
the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart  
  
  
but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light ? 
the next day during the drive to work , the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements  
he is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian  
when the radio comes back to normal , the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully  
his suspicion aroused , he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities  
the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator  
the elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks  
a grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door , made to look like the back of an elevator , into place  
two security guards grab him and throw him out  
truman is really suspicious now  
it gets even worse the next day when his wife , a nurse , describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge  
 "" it's best not to think about it , "" she says , trying vainly to change truman's memory  
truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense  
at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town  
his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world  
you know by now that truman's life is the subject of a television program  
his actions are "" real "" but everything else is carefully scripted , from the death of his father to the choice of his wife  
truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is  
meanwhile , christof , the all-seeing creator of truman's world does his best to keep him unaware and happy  
it's sort of like westworld told from the robots' point of view , or jurassic park from the dinosaurs' point of view  
we root for the captive of the cage-world  
our protagonist is counting on "" chaos theory "" to help him escape his elaborate trap  
the story , written by andrew niccol ( writer/director of gattaca ) , introduces some interesting questions , such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life , or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake  
although these questions came to mind , i don't think the film itself asked them  
it certainly didn't address them or try to answer them  
i was particularly disappointed that the film didn't deal more with the trauma of learning one's life is a tv show  
carrey's performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman's pain , but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film's pacing  
earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well  
the two seemed exclusive of one another , but weir and niccol didn't see it that way  
perhaps it's not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn't , but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here  
but on its own terms , the movie is well made  
sight , sound and pacing are all handled competently  
much of the first part of the movie is the truman show  
the scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras , with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen  
one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio , the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen  
the music is well-chosen and scored  
the film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music , when truman's world is still beautiful and perfect  
when the movie ends , the score sounds more like a frantic , driven , tangerine dream opus , while still keeping the same timbre  
philip glass' epic music ( from powaqqatsi ) permeates truman's scenes of suspicion and awakening  
 ( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show "

1,"the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do  
lives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice  
the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower  
most of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants  
it takes a pretty smart person to do that  
but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? 
what if he's also able to think on his feet ? 
in fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? 
it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f  gary gray's the negotiator  
in this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l  jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force  
when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder  
faced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office  
i don't quite remember if the captain actually said , "" i hate to do this , but    "" , 
although it wouldn't surprise me if he did  
luckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above  
after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j  t  
walsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed  
although roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue  
jackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman  
the actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats  
the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence  
how can we believe he's going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? 
unfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson's acting ability  
almost every time he's in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back  
when spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course  
his is an interesting character  
made out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation  
 "" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , "" he says  
when he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be  
soon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail  
this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor  
as the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely  
gray really lucked out with this cast  
david morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey  
the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d  a  
in l  a  confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land  
with the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven  
also in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides  
his character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything  
fortunately , this doesn't distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout  
j  t  walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances  
sadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film  
walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon  
for one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton  
when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) "

1,"the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes , and the greedy trade federation has used it's armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo  
we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo's ruler , the young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) to sign a treaty giving the federation control  
however , the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade  
no sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi , and the first battle begins  
it seems that for me and thousands of people like me , the love for george lucas's trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time  
we're the fans , not the freaks  
we won't go dressing up like darth vader ( although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool ) , and we won't incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations ( not all the time , anyway ) , but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest , we're throwing down  
all right , stop looking at me like that  
we have been faithfully and patiently waiting  
waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll  
you see , the trilogy is not just a set of movies , but a religion of sorts to we , the faithful disciples , and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah  
unfortunately , it is not our savior  
for weeks beforehand , i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good - stupendously good - miraculously good  
anything less and it'll be the biggest disappointment of the century  
i didn't want the doomsaying prophecy to come true , really i didn't , but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking  
character development is virtually nonexistent  
with the possible exception of qui-gon , most of the film's characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions  
none seem very affected by their experiences , and few even show any passion at all  
contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks , a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo , in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala  
jar jar's life is saved by qui-gon early in the film , and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh ( or supposedly so )  
his speech mannerisms are so "" cute-ified "" that i couldn't understand a third of what he was saying , and the slapstick he performed was just distracting  
his head gets caught in an electronic field , his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast , he describes being in trouble as "" deep doo doo , "" and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport  
therein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors  
in star wars , we had obi-wan telling us mos eisley was a "" wretched hive of scum and villainy  "" 
in the phantom menace , we get doo doo  
the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story "" a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away     "" 
this film , on the other hand , constantly reminds me that it's only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience  
perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition ( it's kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses ) , and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500-like play by play  
i liked the pod race ; it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension , but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters ? 
the race would have been even more exciting without the distraction  
this aspect , coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me  
i suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer , but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all ? 
didn't millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again ? 
didn't the action figures still sell like hotcakes ? 
of course they did , and it's only poor judgment that allows the most-eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults  
one aspect that will appeal broadly , however , is the use of special effects  
the people at lucas's industrial light and magic , the world's premiere effects house , outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer-generated images and real-life footage  
some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed , especially the shots of a land battle between the federation's robot army and jar jar's countrymen  
the space battles are also impressive , although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer  
this , however , is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today  
john williams is back , of course , providing a score for the film as only he can  
his music is pervasive throughout , as rousing and as dramatic as ever , always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately  
since this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine-episode story ( star wars , the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four , five and six , respectively ) , the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already , in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar  
as a result , attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin  
it would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obi-wan , for example , but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover , it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films  
one of the new characters is darth maul , hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film's release  
in spite of the hype , darth maul is a character which almost didn't have to be in the film , his role is so insignificant  
he has maybe three spoken lines ( believe it or not , a second actor voices the character ) and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean  
with that working against him , he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment  
lucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe , something which has been prominent throughout  
however , he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible , offering an easy out for story-writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a real-life connection  
oddly , while trying to capitalize on spirituality , lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force-loving parasites in your body's cells "

1,"vannesa kensington : `austin , do you smoke after sex ? ' austin powers : `i don't know baby , i've never looked ! ' 
and so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer season  
austin powers 2 , the sequel to the sleeper hit of 1997 , is filled to the brim with uproarious sight gags and lurid toilet jokes that will make you keel over with hilarity  
the mind of mike myers is obviously a very bizarre place  
myers returns as the swinging 60's spy and his arch-nemesis , the bald headed dr  evil , who is given much of the spotlight here  
there's an early scene in which dr  evil and his son scott ( seth green ) appear on a jerry springer segment entitled `my dad is evil and wants to take over the world' , hosted by springer himself  
most of these talk-show gags , spoofing everything from oprah to regis and kathie lee , are no longer as funny as they once were  
happily , this is an exception , especially when a fight breaks out between dr  evil and the other guests  
 ( sample dialogue- `come back here you mother #@%$^ ! ! 
you want a piece of me ? ' ) 
the audience was in stitches  
there are many good things about this sequel  
dr  evil is now assisted by mini-me ( verne troyer ) , a pint-sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry  
mini-me is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for , and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does , pinkie and all  
mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina , evil's loud-mouth assassin sidekick , and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber  
this works surprisingly well  
afterward , there's even a meeting at the coffee machine , where their awkwardness is expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment  
oh , yes    
the plot  
after a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington ( elizabeth hurley ) that goes disastrously wrong , powers is back on the case to thwart the diabolical plans of dr  evil  
in the original , the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods  
here , it's time travel  
dr  evil has this crazy plan to steal austin's mojo ( the source of his sexual powers ) , so he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when powers is still is his freezing chamber  
there , he employs a grotesque 600-pound scottish assassin named fat bastard ( also myers ) to commandeer the mojo , so that our future hero is left completely shagless  
meanwhile , austin is informed of evil's wrong-doing by basil exposition ( michael york ) , and is supplied with his very own time-traveling device in the form of a volkswagen beetle  
once back in 1969 , powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell ( heather graham ) , and learns of dr  evil's plans to destroy washington dc with a lazer on the moon  
in one of the many uproarious jabs at star wars , evil calls the moon base a `death star'  
if there ever was a movie that knew from the start it was a complete joke , it's austin powers : the spy who shagged me  
ap2 has many hilarious moments , much more so , than the original austin powers  
but what it doesn't have is the confident support system that the first boasted , and the jokes are now more scattershot and hit-and-miss  
while myers has a knack for delivering clever , inspired gags , he sometimes doesn't know when to call it quits  
the hilarious scene in the original involving mustafa ( will ferrell ) and his refusal to die is played out here in a disappointing and tired manner  
robert wagner , as dr  evil's #2 man , has only one scene early on in the film , where he lacks all the focus of the character  
one nice surprise is rob lowe , as the young #2 , who patterns wagner's voice and movements right down to a tee  
there are more recycled jokes from the predecessor , including kristen johnston as ivana humpalot ( an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina )  
but myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project , and many bits are side-splittingly funny  
don't miss an extended visual gag in a tent , where the shadows leave much to the imagination     
of the new characters , graham doesn't leave much of an impression  
her performance is merely okay , and she lacks the gung-ho enthusiasm that made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her  
and as for fat bastard  "

1,"no humans were harmed , tested or tasted in the making of this film  
all recipes are fictions  
twentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism  
a psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul ! 
director/writer antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts , but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves   
 ""   they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive   "" 
this true story , briefly mentioned in "" the shining "" , has no turned into a 143 minutes long motion picture  
in 1847 , the united states was a land of pioneers , of gold-starved americans making their way west  
it was a period of manifest destiny , the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries , stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could  
capt  john boyd ( guy pearce ) has become both a "" hero "" and a victim during this period of relentless consumption    
in ways he could never have imagined  
boyd's journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific mexican-american war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost , a waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california  
upon his arrival he is greeted by a small , motley group of soldiers , including his commanding officer , hart ( jeffrey jones ) , a previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life ; toffler ( jeremy davies ) , the fort's personal emissary to the lord ; knox ( stephen spinella ) , the veterinarian that plays doctor , who never met a bottle of whiskey he didn't like ; reich ( neal mcdonough ) , the no-nonsense soldier of the group ; and the seriously "" over-medicated "" cleaves ( david arquette ) , a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions  
into this cold , bleak and bizarre world staggers a stranger , colqhoun ( robert carlyle ) , a half-starved scot who had been traveling with a group of settlers until they became snowbound  
seeking refuge in a cave , they soon ran out of food - and were forced to consume one another  
colqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors d'oeuvre himself  
our heroes then decide to journey through the mountains to find the survivors , and colqhoun tags along to help out  
soon it becomes clear that colqhoun's tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will to survive  
it involves an old indian myth called weendigo , which states that a man who eats the flesh of another steals that person's strength , spirit and very essence  
his hunger becomes an insatiable craving : the more he eats , the more he wants , and the stronger he becomes  
there can never be enough , and death is the only escape   
it's all fairly sickening and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the whole movie through  
as professionally made as the movie is , you have to wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this  
teen-age horror fans won't care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell  
older folks might show up when they hear that the movie is actually a satire about the pioneer spirit , but they'll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces  
but jokes aside , this is a film that is well worth watching  
it has wonderful and mature characters , that few horror film s can boast of and a strangely effective story that continues to electrify you till the end  
the two main characters are also the most interesting  
boyd is a simple , honest man tiered of war , killing and fear  
his sacred wish is to live a normal , quite life away from gunpowder and blood  
colqhoun is different  
he proves that a man , on the brink of death , would do anything to stay alive , including sacrificing his own soul  
he believes so much in this indian myth that he starts to change physically  
it is the power of the human mind and conviction that make miracles happen  
the atmosphere in "" ravenous "" is macabre and bizarre , scary and surreal  
completely isolated from the rest of the world , stands fort spencer  
here time stands still , and nothing changes  
the inhabitants are soldiers driven by war and pillage  
they are all somehow losers of society that have been banished -- men that are used to killing and have not done anything else in their entire life  
men that are nothing , and has nothing to loose  
the result is some sort of cabin fever  
cannibalism is more like a sick game for them  
since they find no pleasure in living , they find some excitement in killing and dying  
it's like "" who's going to die first ? "" 
the unchangeable icy landscape , where birds do not sing and even wind doesn't move the leaves on the trees , resembles kubrick's "" the shining "" "
1,"you've got to love disney  
no matter what they serve up , it is a guaranteed success as long as it's animated  
kids have to go see the movie  
then they have to get the toys  
oh , the video came out ? 
got to buy it , or risk little billy's temper tantrums for the next month  
all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca : a visit to the magic kingdom  
stay at the disneyland hotel ! 
buy a disney t-shirt ! 
eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick ! 
it's both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it  
dale carnegie should have had it so good  
what's most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality  
you see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot  
the theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not  
the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same  
however , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box-office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer  
luckily , disney's latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula  
the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan-yu ( miguel ferrer )  
soon , china's emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china's defense  
when the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household  
fearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming-na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army  
mulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling  
mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman's role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that "" grace "" is not one of her strong points  
very early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one's family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task  
by leaving home to fight in her father's place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too  
as is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film  
i'm not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time  
both lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan's army unit and obligatory love interest , are more than competent , although salonga's voice translates much better to animation  
you have to hear it to understand  
interestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan  
there is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie  
it is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney's own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing  
artistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically "" disneyfied "" ethnic tale  
there are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan-yu's hun army , which utilizes the same computer-enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast  
the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it  
when mulan resolves to take her father's place , she dons her father's old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword  
as she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal  
it just left me thinking , "" that was really cool  "" 
a wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon-tek oh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang's conscripted army  
even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan  
although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance  
i found the choice of b  d  
wong as shang a little strange ( you may remember him as martin short's wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride ) , but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast , so i guess anything's possible  
in any event , wong performs admirably as well  
one character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa  
she deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie , but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people  
june foray , who supplies grandmother fa's speaking voice , is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale ( as in boris and natasha )  
marni nixon , who provides grandmother fa's singing voice , is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i , maria in west side story , and eliza in my fair lady  
with this in mind , hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history  
mulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films  
in an effort to be culturally sensitive ( and to avoid a "" miss saigon "" -type debacle ) , disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian-american actors for both lead and supporting roles  
in addition to the actors already mentioned , the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong , gedde watanabe , james shigeta , and george takei  
i guess clyde kusatsu wasn't available "

1,"after hearing reviews for woody allen's upteenth movie in history , "" celebrity , "" range from terribly boring to just so-so , my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of "" manhattan , "" my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time  
woody allen's films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair , so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand-in-hand ( "" manhattan "" really is one of the best-looking films i've ever seen , beautiful black and white photography of the city's best areas , etc  ) , a fan can't help but feel visibly moved  
the film opens up , with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds , and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack , but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky , with the word "" help "" being spelled with an airplane  
beethoven's 5th blasts on the soundtrack  
the city seems to stop to take notice of this moment , and it's all rather lovely to look at  
and then we cut to a film crew , shooting this as the film's hilariously banal key moment in the film , where the lead actress in the film ( melanie griffith , looking as buxom and beautiful as ever ) has to realize something's wrong with her life or whatever  
it's a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film , with the great opening shots or without , and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again , a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works ( though , for the record , last year's "" deconstructing harry "" came awfully close )  
what the hell has happened to him ? 
the man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny , but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas  
 "" bullets over broadway , "" though wonderful , relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off  
 "" mighty aphrodite "" is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story  
 "" everyone says i love you "" was more of a great idea than a great film  
even "" deconstructing harry "" is admittingly cheap in a way , even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films  
if anything , the reception of "" celebrity "" by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time , it's not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is : it's him  
 "" celebrity "" is , yes , a good film , but it's only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film  
instead of creating the great woody allen world , he's created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about  
and he's fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities , so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections  
it's like "" la dolce vita "" without the accuracy , the right amount of wit , and the correct personal crisis  
woody , becoming more insecure in his old age , choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities , and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny , and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead  
much has been said about his performance - dead on but irritating , makes one yearn for the real thing , blah blah blah - but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh's performance , though featuring some of the same mannerisms ( stuttering , whining , lots o' hand gestures ) , is hardly a warts-and-all impersonation  
branagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm , which actually allows for his character's flaws to be more apparent  
woody's a flawed guy , and we know it , but we love him anyway , because he's really funny and really witty and really intelligent  
branagh's allen is a bit more flat-out bad , but with the same charm so that , yes , we like him , but we're still not sure if he's really a good person or not  
his character , lee simon , is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie , hits on extra actress winona ryder , then goes off to interview griffith , who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her , and she denies him    sorta  
we then learn , through flashbacks , that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid-life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion  
he has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts , covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate , so that he can meet them , and maybe sell his script ( a bank robbery movie "" but with a deep personal crisis "" )  
as such , he has divorced his wife of several years ( allen regular judy davis ) , and continues on a quest for sexual happiness , boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film  
after griffith comes his escapades with a model ( charlize theron ) who is "" polymorphously perverse "" ( glad to see allen is using new jokes , ha ha ) , who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of "" la dolce vita  "" 
following are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen , a relationship that almost assures him success , and his continued escapades with ryder , whom he fancies most of all  
his story is juxtaposed with that of davis , who flips out , but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome , friendly tv exec ( joe mantegna ) who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status  
while lee is fumbling about , selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness , davis becomes happy ( "" i've become the kind of woman i've always hated    and 
i'm loving it  "" ) 
without doing a thing  
the result is a film of highs and mediums  
the mediums are what take up most of the film , with sitations and scenes which don't exactly work but you can't help but pat allen on the back for trying  
but other places are really great scenes  
the opening  
the sequence with theron , which is so good that i wished it hadn't ended  
a banana scene with bebe neuwirth ( droll as ever )  
and , perhaps the best sequence : a romp with hot-as-hell teen idol , brandon darrow , played by none other than leo dicaprio , who is so un-dicaprio-esque that if any of this fans could sit through this film , they'd never look at him the same way  
he ignites the screen with intensity , and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical , and totally heartbreaking for lee , who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read , and finds himself on a wild all-day ride with him  
they go to atlantic city to watch a fight , they gamble , and they wind up in his hotel room , where darrow gets it on with his flame ( gretchen mol ) and he lends him one of the leftover groupies  
allen's writing in these scenes are so good that just for them , i'd almost recommend the film  
almost  
but what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that it's a mess , despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself , it's still a smart and insightful film  
though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced ( some seem too cartoonish , even for this environment ) , allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities , as it may seem to be ( if it were , it'd be extremely out-of-touch ) , but about those who want to be celebrities , and how they equate celebrity-hood with happiness "

1,"one of the sweetest tales to ever be made , it's a wonderful life isn't perfect , but its good natured charm and beautiful performances light up the screen with glorious results  
probably the greatest "" feel-good "" film of all time , it's a wonderful life aims for the heart , and strikes with a golden arrow  
on christmas eve , george bailey ( stewart ) is being prayed for by many in the small town of bedford falls  
you see , george is in trouble , and he has always helped others who needed it  
this one time , however , god answers his prayers , and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence ( travers ) to try and save george  
clarence has got his own problems , however  
clarence is an angel without his wings , and each time the bell rings , the wings pass him by  
the bailey case is a way for him to earn those magical wings and become a true angel  
but before clarence can save george , he first has to go through a cliffs notes version of george bailey's life  
we see george sacrificing his hearing to save his brother's life , sacrificing his college education to save the family business , sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother , and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else  
when the bank his family owns is in trouble , george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure the bank isn't sold to the evil mr  potter ( barrymore ) , who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls  
one christmas , potter gets his chance  
uncle billy bailey ( mitchell ) loses $8 , 000 of the bank's money  
without the money , the bank must close down  
george is stuck in a tremendous bind , and contemplates suicide  
clarence , the faithful servant , is there just to pick him up , and to show him what bedford would be like without george  
this is all a lead-in to the very famous last scene , where george finally sees what true happiness is about  
it's a wonderful life does have its faults  
the movie is beginning to feel dated in the details , especially in the treatment of women and men  
the sex roles in the film are weirdly out of place in the 90's , like something out of a revisionist look  
all the men drink too much and slap their wives too much during some portions of the film  
there are , however , endearing moments in all of this  
capra puts in just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the 50's to make the movie remarkably enjoyable  
the story is hackneyed , and the ending feels , well , a little too sugarish  
there's this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything , especially the sequences where george is either in trouble , or helping somebody  
it's a little too nice for my liking , at times  
there is , however , enough humor , enough wit , and enough of jimmy stewart to get the movie through the middle part , which would be the most difficult  
but watching it's a wonderful life is never boring or difficult : it's always interesting , right until the finale , which , for all its sugar , makes delightful sense and is beautifully done  
capra does have his monumental cliches , but the actors relish them and overplay everything to perfection  
donna reed is perfect as the loving , obeidient wife , and lionel barrymore is gloriously grump as mr  potter  
everyone else is magnificent , including bert and ernie ( ward bond and frank faylen )  
there is a general sense of goodness , as if everyone in the film knows that they are making a great film , and they relish that  
stewart , however , is the king of all of this  
he is sometimes awkward , especially when saying "" merry christmas "" to all objects , animate or inanimate  
but he is james stewart , and he's lovably delightful throughout the film  
have i complained ? 
i shouldn't have  
this is a really good movie  
no , this is a great movie  
better yet , this is a phenomenal movie  
there is a reason classics are invented : to make sure that people will always have great movies to aid them in their quest for living life  
this is one of those films  
it is a "" feel-good "" movie , something people complain a little too much about  
but capra's reworking of "" a christmas carol "" is the greatest christmas movie of all time  
there , i've said it  
i have to admit , the first time i saw this , i saw it with my family , including my 11 year old kid sister  
they all loved it  
they loved george , his wife , his troubles , and the beautiful ending  
is it a little too sugar-coated ? 
maybe  
no matter "

1,"let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films  
i'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years  
i'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film  
by that point , it was evident that mr  bond was back with a vengeance  
all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience  
it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts  
it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in  
i guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain  
anyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond  
i think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films  
there were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined  
and bond's last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series  
the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series  
everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007  
for the most part , the action sequences worked very well  
although , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film  
i think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted  
while he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film  
most noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie  
he almost seemed like he didn't know what he was doing  
but they were brief scenes and really shouldn't take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing  
if you have ever seen a bond film , you won't be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit  
the world is not enough is no exception  
this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world  
007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain  
why this point is included is beyond me  
they took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought  
anyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid-east oil pipeline  
i guess world domination just isn't as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore  
bond is brought in to protect the pipeline's owner , elektra king ( sophie marceau ) , who is the daughter of one of renard's recent victims  
along the way , bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist , dr  christmas jones ( denise richards ) , and his old rival valentin zukovsky ( robert carlyle )  
like all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words  
my biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films  
there was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing  
the buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau's character  
it was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film  
later , it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something  
but because it is a bond film , the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly  
after all , it isn't shakespeare  
how about the cast ? 
brosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007  
i grew up with the roger moore version of bond , so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character  
judi dench , as m , had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role  
she brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner  
robbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye , so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie  
coltrane gets more screen time , which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes  
then there are the bond girls  
sophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today  
there is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim  
those that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face "

1,"one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made , "" se7en "" is just a few steps away from brilliance  
however , those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss  
the film received mixed reviews upon release , but there's an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice  
at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing , but the script and the ultimate pay-off are excellent  
the shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable  
this piece of work is 100% intensity  
it's uncomfortable to watch , yet compelling  
 "" i want not to look , yet i cannot turn away  "" 
the story creeps along slowly and deliberately , crafted by visionary director david fincher  
he has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions , but not giving away too much too soon  
this is the guy who directed the ominous "" alien 3 ""  
 "" se7en "" is even more ominous because the threat is real  
it's human and , while the script takes some artistic licence , the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic  
that is , if a human being could be so intelligent , patient , wealthy , and disillusioned  
after the most bizarre opening credits i've ever seen ( refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment ) , the initial character development takes place  
morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset , a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society  
brad pitt co-stars as detective david mills , the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys  
these two fine actors give the film its human qualities ( along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow , who plays tracy , mills' wife )  
however , none of them stands out above the material  
no disrespect intended , but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same  
an ironic note is that somerset has only a week ( or 7 , that's seven , days ) left on the force to train his young protege  
the title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins , as chronicled by john milton in "" paradise lost "" --gluttony , greed , sloth , lust , pride , envy , & wrath  
incidentally , i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found  
it's the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking , but i won't give that away  
as i said , this has a great ending and no one should spoil it  
anyway , the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the "" sinners "" suffer for it  
the two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man  
they learn that he was murdered--forced to eat himself to death  
the killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and , of course , somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way  
if they didn't , it would be one short movie ! 
the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story  
we see a lot of blood , but it's not especially violent  
the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown--like most of the violence in "" pulp fiction ""  
 "" se7en "" is gory , graphic , and disturbing , but all the gore is post-death  
still , if you tend to get queasy , don't eat food during this film  
kevin spacey plays john doe , the avenging angel who claims that he's the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings  
like many crazy men , he has some fine ideas , but some sick ways of expressing himself  
spacey doesn't appear until the final 30 minutes and also doesn't receive billing in the opening credits  
however , it's his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination  
a great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not  
this character is so well written that it's hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone  
no serial killer has ever been so creative  
 "" se7en "" is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and it's often a little too depressing  
what it lacks in those areas , it makes up for with believable dialogue , top-notch screenwriting , unexpected twists , and realistic characters  
the technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive  
fincher uses lighting , music , and editing quite well , but his story is always the thrust of the film  
fortunately , we don't find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits ( which are run backwards up the screen ! )  
it's better to imagine what paths they will follow  
this is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget  
it's got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thing--the evils of the world aren't going to cure themselves  
 "" se7en "" raises some tough questions and it's intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves  
useless trivia--co-stars in 1995's "" se7en "" , brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the 1995 best supporting actor oscar--pitt in "" 12 monkeys "" , spacey in "" the usual suspects "" ( for which he won ) "
1,"more than forty years ago , the "" sword and sandals "" genre of historical epic ruled the box office  
during the 1950's hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope  
 "" ben-hur  "" 
 "" cleopatra  "" 
 "" the robe  "" 
 "" sparticus  "" 
 "" the fall of the roman empire  "" 
 "" quo vadis  "" 
sometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood  
since then , epics have appeared infrequently ( "" the last emperor , "" "" braveheart "" ) and some of the best have been small-screen affairs produced in the 1970's ( "" roots , "" "" shogun "" )  
yet , the phrase "" we who are about to die salute you "" has been absent until now  
 "" gladiator "" begins in germania in a  d  180  
roman general maximus ( russell crowe ) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting  
however , the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) will prove a poor successor , so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again  
when commodus hears the plan , he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered  
maximus escapes from the executioners , but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son  
a caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa  
 ( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus' place is never explained  ) 
an african named juba ( djimon hounsou ) treats maximus' wounds  
proximo ( oliver reed ) , a gladiator who won his freedom , purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena  
of course , maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier , and his fame spreads  
when commodus reopens the coliseum , proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete  
our hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus' sister lucilla ( connie nielsen )  
the similarities to "" braveheart "" are obvious : an evil king , a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family , the aid of a lovestruck princess  
also , like mel gibson's epic , "" gladiator "" has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero's anger  
it's a simple tale of good versus evil  
maximus has all the manly virtues : nobility of purpose , courage in battle , loyalty to king and country , physical stamina , and devotion to family  
commodus is his opposite in every way : a sniveling , selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience  
the opening night crowd in my theater was about 70% male , and that seems appropriate  
 "" gladiator "" is a guy movie ( would the opposite of a "" chick flick "" be a "" dick flick "" ? )  
there's much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences  
 ( those easily offended by gore should stay away  ) 
lucilla is the only female character , and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife  
joaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance  
in the scene where commodus kills his father , phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father's love or pride  
throughout the picture , phoenix manages to give depth to a character who's scripted as a caricature of evil  
i've been a russell crowe fan since "" romper stomper  "" 
this role doesn't offer him the complexities of his parts in "" l  
a  confidential "" and "" the insider "" -- essentially his job is to grunt heroically -- but his voice , which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp , is perfect for the genre  
the late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role  
i hope it will be rewarded with an oscar  
my only major quibble with "" gladiator "" is its stylized look  
several scenes are tinted  
we've seen a lot of the tinted look lately , particularly in "" payback "" and "" the matrix  "" 
i don't get the appeal of the style , which makes feature films look like tv ads  
in "" payback "" it was merely annoying , but in "" gladiator "" it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d'etre of the roman epic  
 ( perhaps it's meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer-generated shots  ) 
also , the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously "

1,"one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable  
you know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is  
sure , it's been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch  
this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun  
one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story  
this rule applies highly to kiss the girls  
there is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made  
however , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through  
well , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up  
unfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits  
that may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery  
however , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film  
plotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality  
we are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero  
he gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself  
obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene  
at his house , cross is told that his neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been missing for four days  
this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can't sympathize with detective cross  
however , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees    
before she is abducted  
dr  kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd family ) is a smart , athletic woman , and because of these traits , becomes a target for casanova--what the serial killer likes to call himself  
because of these character-developing scenes , we care for mctiernan , making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful  
after being abducted , mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods  
remembering that the killer gave her certain rules , she decides to break one of them by calling out  
when casanova comes to punish her , she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall  
after she is found , she begins to help cross find his neice  
from this moment on , kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film , as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive  
many people will compare this film to 1995's seven , another killer film starring morgan freeman , but i presume that the similarities are intentional  
the screenplay , by david klass , is adapted from the novel written by james patterson , and yet i don't quite see how this story could have worked in novel form  
what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness  
the cinematography , by aaron schneider , is reminiscient of seven , and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us  
sometimes a simple shot is the best one  
however , many of the shots are stunning , and unlike seven , most of them take place during the day , in sunlight  
the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done , in more than one way  
the camera work is terrific , but the editing makes this scene work so well  
the chaotic and mtv-type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness , exactly what judd's character is experiencing  
however , the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors  
morgan freeman is one of today's most powerful and believable actors  
detective cross is a very good character for him , although it is just a similar one to the character in seven  
because of freeman's powerful presence , he carries half the film by himself  
the other half is carried by ashley judd , one of today's most promising dramatic actresses  
in fact , her performance is better than freeman's , if that is even possible  
her character is more original than freeman's , and she handles it wonderfully  
we finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream  
the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped , but the cast members do as much as they can with it  
cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina , and unfortunately has scraps for a character  
tony goldwyn fairs slightly better , but we don't really get to know his character either  
gina ravera gives a good performance , but again she isn't in many of the scenes "

1,"i'm not really sure what to think about "" crash  "" 
on the surface , it's a cold , boring , unerotic porn with name starts , a name director , and some cool camerawork  
i mean , it left me completely bored , unsatisfied , and generally kinda weirded out  
but then again , not every film's supposed to leave you entertained  
 "" crash "" is structured to play like a porn flick , but with significantly more plot and dialogue  
while we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex , we also have a skimpy little plot going on ( mostly towards the beginning ) , and maybe just a hair of characterization  
not to mention the acting is generally pretty good , and we don't really see a lot of the actors completely exposed  
but what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience  
this film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of "" henry and june "" or the just plain horniness of , say , "" deep throat "" ( not that i've seen it )  
if one was to be made completely hot by this film , it would probably mean they were also into the whole "" auto eroticism "" thing  
the film leaves you cold erotically ( and maybe in many other ways ) , but what it does is present a group of people who live on the edge  
the film opens up on a woman , catherine ( deborah kara ungar , of "" the game "" ) , pressing her bare breast up against a car in a public air hangar  
suddenly , a man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind ( the film doesnt' show all this though , even if it is nc-17 )  
the next scene has a film director , james ( james spader ) , having sex with a camera woman ( alice poon ) in an office on the highly-populated set of his movie  
the next scene has the two coming together , revealing to us that they're husband and wife , and them sharing in one another's escapades  
while the two are arguably freaky people , we at least know they love to live on the edge  
soon afterwards , james is driving down the road at night , reclessly of course ( he's reading something ) , when he drifts into the other lane , and then hits another car face on  
james is not killed , but the passenger in the other car flies into his seat ( obviously dying ) , leaving the driver , helen remington ( holly hunter - in a porn ? ) , also alive  
the two go through therapy together , and when getting out , they run into eachother again  
when james gives her a ride home , they almost get into another accident , and immeadiately afterwards , they go to an unbusy parking lot , and have a little quickie , as they were aroused by the accident  
you wouldn't think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish , but they run into a freaky guy named vaughan ( elias kosteas ) and his crutch-carrying girlfriend , gabrielle ( rosanna arquette ) , who are also into it  
vaughan is into living on the edge as they are , but he takes it to another level : he loves to recreate famous car crashes  
in one scene , he and a friend , colin seagrave ( peter macneill ) recreate james dean's car crash without any padding or safety belts , and suffer some concussions , but nevertheless get a rush ( and the attention of the police )  
soon , these five are all having sex with one another , be it straight , gay , or lesbian sex  
while this is admittingly all a bit comical ( the film is almost like a black comedy ) , the film does do a pretty awesome portrayal of people who's main fetish is living on the edge  
i'm sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents , but i personally don't see a connection between car crashes and sex  
the main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush  
his car crash scenes are quick and exciting mini-masterpieces : we're at first not sure if they'll take place , but everytime it looks like it may occur , we gasp  
then when it happens , we hold our breath  
the same thing happens with sex , although not in the same fashion  
these people are merely taking it to another level  
the only problem with the film is that it's a tad redundant  
a normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and a half  
this goes on for about 100 minutes , and it just seems a little too long  
the sex and car crashes are far between one another , and the time between them are a tad on the boring side  
there's no characterization , although it could definitely be argued , that hey , it's a porn , and we're not here to sympathize  
but still , they coulda cut it down a bit  
but the film is saved with its presentation , as well as some other elements  
the atmosphere is very dark and forboding , creating a kind of cool weird feeling  
and there are several scenes are just amazing  
one scene has catherine and james having sex , while she softly asks him questions about being with a man , which sounds almost erotic the way she says it  
a sequence involving one character's death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs  
and the final shot is shot perfectly , creating an image of a car crash , and a couple having sex in front of it , despite the fact that she's wounded  
the acting is also pretty good , especially for what is almost a porn ( ousting linda lovelace as best actress in a porn )  
while james spader is pretty boring ( he's usually pretty intense ) , deborah kara ungar is amazing  
she speaks all her words in almost zombie-like hushes , and when she's having sex , she has a blank look on her face , not showing the viewer whether she's enjoying it or not  
in one scene , she actually looks dead while someone is having sex with her  
holly hunter , who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this , is pretty good , and so is rosanna arquette ( who adds a kinda cool kinkiness to her role )  
but the film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone  
he often speaks as he is out of breath , showing a definite affinity for his way of life  
he has a great deal of energy in several scenes , especially one scene where he's taking photographs of a picture , and a later scene where he's getting a freaky tatoo "

1,"showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven , director , and joe eszterhas , writer  
their last effort , basic instinct , played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry-spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone's taste , but certainly a well-crafted movie  
possibly that movie's greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage , prior to the movie , during the movie , and after the movie    
and that , after bringing all the plotlines together neatly , it left the viewer with full knowledge of what * would * happen in the characters' future , so there was no need to film it  
there was actually about four hours' worth of screen story there , but eszterhas found ways to get it all on-screen in two , by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on ; and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails  
the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls  
we have attractive , sympathetic , but still highly repellent characters ; we have shows for the eyes and the ears , plotlines that play on several levels , we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable , and we have a story of an innocent ( who may not be so innocent ) who's trying to play straight , trying to improve her station in life , who slips into behaving the way those around her do    
but recovers with a flourish , and quits a winner  
in this sense , the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven , who's not known for treating his characters well ; but nomi , the part played by elizabeth berkley , definitely opts out of the game in a positive way , and we're left feeling good about her future  
this is not one of the great movies , but it's far better than we'd been led to expect by all the negative pre-release publicity  
verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 , and in the last quarter-century has pushed farther and farther , experimenting with the socially-acceptable limits to movie-making  
his most recent three movies , robocop , total recall , and basic instinct , have been a progression of back-door access to american culture , moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives ; and now he's exploring the sleeze  
this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director's contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie  
 ( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating , although his original version is available on video  ) 
many reviewers have taken the politically-correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing ; but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies , it's about people in an environment where naked ladies are common , and why such an environment should exist  
it's about the scum who use other people as power-trip toys , and the need to escape their power  
it's about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don't pertain ; and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment  
an nc-17 movie which isn't sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty , power , or value  
the one scene in the movie that * could * have been a good sex scene , berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool , is not exciting , because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator  
if anything , it's a rape scene with a victim who's been duped into cooperation  
you don't make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors ; you don't make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed ; and you don't make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls    
and in an awful lot of vegas shows , an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing  
this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry , in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity  
showgirls de-glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness  
nomi is played , in a very good performance , by elizabeth berkley , who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who's at the end of her rope , desperate to live a life better than the one she's known  
she has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability , and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker , trying to be something better than she seems destined to be  
when nomi realizes she's gone too far for too little , she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be  
gina rivera plays molly , a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi , providing her with what may be the one solid , positive relationship in nomi's entire life  
molly is the one who makes the difference , and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she'll be using for the rest of her life , and nomi's feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi's decision  
gina gershon plays cristal , an aging , but still very attractive starring dancer , a reflexively competitive manipulator who's become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her  
gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch ; a fading talent made bitter by self-awareness  
her character is very well drawn and performed ; in a major scene in a hospital room , she acknowledges what she is , and , in essence , passes the torch to nomi  
the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie , and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path  
it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe ; molly is an honest , hard-working person who means well , and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality  
cristal is a talented dancer who's compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a co-operating part of the system , exchanging self-respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas  
nomi believes she can make it without selling herself , succumbs to a degree , and then realizes she can make it without selling herself , and doesn't need las vegas or its brand of "" stardom  "" 
the male parts in this movie are simply props ; they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist  
kyle maclachlan , whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden , gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs , camouflaged as a nice guy  
glenn plummer plays a dancer who's working as a bellboy , and provides a bit of alternate perspective  
plummer's character is the only one in the movie who's maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art , but even he's succumbed to the cult of manipulation  
plummer's character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie  
some of jost vacano's cinematography is fantastic , and one particular delineation of nomi's character alteration , a no-dialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting , is utterly terrifying  
this movie is rated nc-17 due to language , sexual situations , full frontal nudity , violence , and probably the costuming as well  
i don't see a way this particular story could have been told well without it , and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie-making  
but don't go see it if you're not in a tough mood ; the only person it's possible to like in this movie ends up in an i "

1,"in october of 1997 , audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer  
the film went on to gross over 70 million dollars in the u  s  , and even developed a cult following , much like the previous year's 100 million dollar grossing scream  
when the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend , it looked like a wonderful follow-up  
did it live up to the first film ? 
the answer is no  
jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james , a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before  
she has been so upset since the incident  
nightmares haunt her all over the place , but she has to move on  
she know attends college , and is best friends with a funny , outgoing girl named karla ( brandy ) , who is trying to hook julie up with will benson , played by newcomer matthew settle  
karla's boyfriend is tyrell , the funny , outgoing type , who is played by soul food's mekhi phifer  
freddie prinze jr  also returns as ray , julie's boyfriend from a year ago  
one morning , julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil  
of course , they answer it correctly , and they are off to the bahamas  
julie wants ray to come , but he declines the offer , so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie  
after they arrive at their hotel , it is just them and the staff on the island  
it starts off as the weekend of their dreams  
something just had to come to mess up the one care-free weekend of julie's life though  
ben willis ( muse watson ) is back , and he isn't letting anyone survive this time  
will ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one ? 
jennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances  
brandy in particular was impressive , considering this is her first feature film  
you could see that the characters were horrified , and they would do anything possible to survive  
matthew settle and freddie prinze jr  are a completely different story  
let's start with settle  
matthew is completely fake in this film  
you could not believe a word coming out of his mouth  
you could tell he was acting , and its reasons like him that this one isn't as good as the first one  
he does do a good job towards the end , but that doesn't clear up the scars he already left on the film  
freddie prinze jr  is almost as bad as matthew settle was  
he is almost completely unbelievable , and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place  
we don't see him as much as settle , otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did  
mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell , but yet again the dialogue is out of place  
the plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie  
i like where the filmmakers went with this second installment , but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one , it would have been a bit better  
the cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful  
there are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel  
the sound is pretty good , but still not as creepy as the first film's  
jennifer love hewitt's song , "" how do i deal "" is also played for about thirty seconds  
i still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film  
the first film was very suspenseful , and it contained some very memorable scenes  
the last fifteen minutes of i still know what you did last summer really picked up , and almost reached the same level as the first film  
before this part in the film , there are many unnecessary deaths and fake scares  
that is okay though , because the film is still very much fun and there are a few suspenseful scenes  
i think the reason this film wasn't as scary as the original was because in the first one , the killer terrorized the people involved in the incident  
he made them suffer for what they did  
in the second film , ben willis just kills anyone he feels like  
he doesn't stick with ray and julie , who were the ones he is actually after  
he had to go after karla , will , and tyrell "

1,"_in brief : _ this film needs no introduction  
if you haven't heard of it , then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical , and if you haven't seen it -- well , i suspect you're in a small minority ! 
first thing's first ? is it all it's hyped up to be ? 
well , yes ? and no  
it's a good film , and there's a lot to like about it , but it's not without its problems  
when i saw the first trailer for "" titanic "" , it was when i went to see "" bean "" last summer , i think , my intial reaction was -- ain't that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real-life tragedy ? ! 
i mean , what's happened to hollywood's script-writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ? 
gads , whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ? 
i was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i wasn't alone in that respect  
it's when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) and anyone who'd been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice ! 
i didn't see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) , 
so i went with a slightly more open mind , but i still didn't think i'd enjoy it much  
did i ? yes and no  
mainly yes , i'm happy to say  
the first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i'll talk about that later ? ) but because the re-created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron's directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the "" human "" aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting  
the film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a' course ! 
 : - ) )  
well , it's an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat  
does it work here ? 
in script form it doesn't add all that much to the story  
what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film  
her presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her  
also impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving  
it's an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack's "" rescuing "" rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching  
in fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance  
it's engaging , touching and very enjoyable  
there's more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well , simply because you know it's not going to be a happy ending  
which leads us to the second half of the film  
we all knew it was coming  
i'm sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it , because as he's stated in interviews , the real thrust of the story ( for him ) was the sinking , and the jack/rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film  
i think that understates the importance of the romance , as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die  
the iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour  
and it is an hour  
my goodness , we don't miss a second of that hour ? 
gratuitous ? well , perhaps not by today's standards , i'm sure there's been far worse produced under the banner of "" entertainment "" in other films  
but i certainly wasn't prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be  
not that i'd expect the word "" understatement "" to be part of cameron's vocabulary ( he who brought us such , umm , vivid films as "" terminator 2 "" and "" aliens "" )  
is it overdone ? 
i thought so  
understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy  
no , no one expected a happy ending , but i didn't quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film's second half  
still , whether it was overdone and heavy-handed or not , if it was the shock-factor cameron was after it worked , because i was shocked and moved , in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears ! 
you really couldn't help but get emotionally involved , whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose's overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack , or that jack would rescue rose , or that they would both survive  
perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk , and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface  
the bit where rose lets go of jack's hand , while promising she'll never let go in her heart was particularly heart-wrenching , and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image , to put no fine a point on it  
i loved the ending , however , which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half  
so , we've established that the film is powerful and moving , if the last hour was rather excessive  
haven't mentioned the script  
plot-wise it's ok , though the jack/rose relationship was beautifully developed , but i've a feeling that's to the actors credit if anything  
as for the dialogue ? well , titanic is set in 1912  
it's a period drama  
but i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned  
did they really use phrases like "" goddamn it ! "" 
back in the turn of the century ? 
i doubt it  
would someone talk like this : "" do ya love the guy or what ? ""  
i doubt it  
is such dialogue as "" i saw the iceberg , and i see it in your eyes now "" not just a bit ? clumsy ? 
yes it is  
a little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray , and cameron himself is to blame ( he wrote the script )  
stick with directing , dude  
but its more than redeemed by the acting , with dicaprio and winslet on fine form , ably supported by a strong cast  
star of the show was gloria stuart , though -- why didn't she win that oscar ? ! 
after all , they were throwing oscars at "" titanic "" left , right and centre , but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee  
directing-wise cameron does a spectacular job  
like i said , his vision was a bit excessive , but at least he directed it well  
i haven't even mentioned james horner's beautiful score "

1,"trekkies , roger nygard's energetic and hilarious documentary , brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions  
the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non-fans alike  
 ( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs  trekker polemic as not worth arguing about  ) 
the good-spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable , loud giggles , yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe  
denise crosby , who played tasha yar on "" star trek : the next generation , "" serves as the host  
in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary ( oed )  
 ( the oed cites a february , 1976 caption in the "" new yorker "" as the first recorded usage of the word  ) 
unless you've been to the conventions , i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans  
one pointed out , apologetically , that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate  
others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended , several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of  
my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams  
arguably the most famous of all the trekkies , she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die-hard fans do  
her claim to fame is that , as a juror on the whitewater trial , she wore it in court as well  
 "" every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcan-like stoicism , "" she says , describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession  
she doesn't quite understand all of the uproar  
 "" i'm an officer of the federation 24 hours a day , "" she reminds us  
her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith  
along with the laugher the show evokes , there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty  
and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment  
few other avocations could give this much satisfaction  
these people are having the time of their lives  
 ( for the record , i'm not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies  ) 
the film interviews the various star trek series's stars as well as its fans  
the stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and would soon fade , but over twenty years later , the conventions are still going strong  
filled with anecdotes , the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions  
at one , the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel  
after appearing briefly , he drank some water and left  
they decided to auction off his half-empty glass , joking that it had the "" q virus  "" 
the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too  
with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity  
not just flitting among people , the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies  
one guy is a trekkie cross-dresser , another dresses her cat , and then there is the dentist

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
on december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream  
although the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre  
the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes  
the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost  
scream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line's a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight  
and scream's rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion  
it's hard to understate this last point  
mr  williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director )  
indeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr  williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion's share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2's theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional "" a film by wes craven "" drapes the film's title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads "" written by kevin williamson "" , an affirmation of the screenwriter's contribution to the project which may be unprecedented  
 ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of "" a film by "" is attained  ) 
and , much like mr  tarantino's screenwriting , mr  williamson's work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters  
in scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels  
scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr  williamson's rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel  
while the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr  williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it's only at about the film's midway point when it becomes engaging  
like its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film's principal narrative ; this time around , we're following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the "" true life "" events behind the first film has been turned into a movie )  
however , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i've ever seen )  
there are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn't nearly as cleverly frightening as scream's ; while the first film's preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical  
flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film  
the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney  
they're joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded  
the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn't necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ? 
there's a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney's new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy's fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale's newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms  buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens' portia di rossi )  
any of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim  
as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit  
one problem that scream didn't have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer  
here ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr  williamson's screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery  
the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements  
 ( it doesn't help matters any that the killer's alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go  ) 
indeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes  
this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it  
while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it's head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences  
they're staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post-prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are much more fun to watch  
it's hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat-and-mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown  
in terms of its characters , the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music )  
their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well-written -- and there's a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed  
on the other hand , sidney is pretty dull here  
she doesn't have any compelling presence , and there's nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she's the returning heroine  
given this , and the fact that there's no strong second banana character for sidney ( elise neal's role isn't nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan's shoes ) , it's no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film  
what surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast  
the film's mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe ( well , * almost * ) ; while in principal i applaud this bold policy , at some point you've got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel  
 ( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular , whose casting for the next installment of the series would've seemed obvious  ) 
but hey , as rose mcgowan's character said in the first film : "" no , please don't kill me , mr "

produced by bruce cohen & dan jinks written by alan ball directed by sam mendes 
 "" both my wife and daughter think i'm this gigantic loser  
and they're right  
i have lost something  
i didn't always feel this sedated  "" 
with that piece of dialogue , we are fully introduced to lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) , a 42 year old man trapped within his own life  
lester works for an advertising agency  
his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid-life crisis he is suffering  
estranged from both his wife and his daughter , lester starts to crack under the stress  
his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies , and sullen apathy  
carolyn burnham ( annette bening ) , is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker  
she carefully tends her rose garden , decorates her home with the best furnishings  
but inside she is desperate  
unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent , she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family  
the third member of this anti-family is jane burnham ( thora birch ) , lester and carolyn's daughter  
a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence , but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction  
this funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple  
not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her  
some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters  
most notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney ) , the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts  
she has almost no dialogue , and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one  
colonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man  
his rage directed almost singularly at his son , ricky ( wes bentley ) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham's  
in fact they are the next door neighbors  
anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in "" american beauty ""  
alan ball , who was the co-executive producer of the hit tv series "" cybil "" and creator of the new sitcom "" oh grow up "" , has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years  
not one character in this film rings falsely  
and the depth of personality in each , is achingly honest and insightful  
the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as "" the graduate "" or "" lolita ""  
kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances  
his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age  
finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become , lester tries to return to his youth  
he quits his job ( actually blackmailing his employer for one year's salary ) , starts smoking pot , fantasizes about his daughter's girlfriend angela ( mena suvari , in a marvelous performance here ) , starts working out , and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet  
mr  spacey's performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous , that we can be certain that come oscar ? time , we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees  
annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career  
carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy  
unable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder  
ms  bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone  
the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words  
thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her  
jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family , and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment  
her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning  
she is the prototypical trophy child  
when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team ( "" i'm so proud of you , honey  
you didn't screw up once ! "" ) , the bitterness and resentment are palpable  
thora birch is a young actress to watch "

1,"in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance  
ever since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80's  
in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world  
you'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open  
in wonder boys his performance isn't showy or a tour de force , it's simple yet truthful  
he embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes  
grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map  
when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms  
grady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy  
their target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for  
leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions  
he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges  
he's portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated  
he reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog )  
whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white  
leer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth  
tobey maguire fits well in the role  
with his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude  
but unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he's a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility  
katie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady's pants  
this is a plot line i had trouble with  
douglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions  
at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it's because i'm jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas's real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones  
seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping  
suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i'm pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas  
there is a movie in there somewhere  
grady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor  
okay , maybe not so chivalrous  
there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , "" she was a junkie for the printed word  
lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice ""  
robert downy j  r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm  
downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual  
he's arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance  
the actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor  
i wish wonder boys had more of him  
searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that's part of its charm  
and maybe i'm a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i'm greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema  
everyone has a sub-genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to  
i'm privy to films about literary types i  e  
those individuals enthralled by the written word , and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch  
the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points  
sometimes the dialogue is too clever , but that's a problem i wish i found with films more often  
another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted , like its characters , but as the story progresses it begins to open up  
for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types , and as a low-key comedy for its chuckle-worthy throwaway gags  
the gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h , the long goodbye ) movies , where jokes exist as asides on the fringes , like jokes in life often do  
the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog , and incessant smoking of marijuana isn't ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things  
curtis hanson , who before his last film , la confidential , toiled about with exploitation fare like losin' it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle , has graduated to more meaningful films  
he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style , the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up  
the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party , but in a wonder boys party , it fits "

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
james toback's return to directing after a eight-year layoff , two girls and a guy , is a film which is comprised , more or less , of just that : one guy , blake ( robert downey jr  ) ; two girls , carla ( heather graham ) and lou ( natasha gregson wagner ) ; one primary setting ( blake's absurdly spacious bachelor apartment ) , and a great deal of dialogue  
embracing a near real-time approach , this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr  toback for his bantering characters  
fortunately , the film's cast is up to the challenge , and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters , while admittedly variable , are occasionally wickedly amusing  
the film's setup is fairly generic in nature , and opens rather unpromisingly  
we meet self-possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou , both waiting outside a soho loft  
as they engage in idle chatter , it is revealed that they're both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport , and it doesn't take long for them to come to the realisation that they're being two-timed by the same guy  
more indignant with him than catty with each other , the duo break into blake's loft and await his arrival for a confrontation  
it's when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride  
played with magnificent bombast by mr  downey jr  , blake is a cad , all right , but a captivatingly dynamic , blusterous , and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights  
it's fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat , and perhaps the film's best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return , allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others , but by his own innate behaviour  
whether he's flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi , or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds ( carla , lou , and his unseen sickly mother ) , it's never less than wildly entertaining and insightful  
though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one-man show -- a typical afternoon in the life of blake , if you will -- carla , and then lou , reveal themselves , and the sparks begin to fly  
 ( one of the great touches in the film is how blake , when startled by carla's unannounced appearance , begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat's out of the bag  ) 
double-teamed by the understandably aggrieved women ( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful -- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy ) , an increasingly-flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self-righteous declarations against their verbal jabs  
surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters , two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off-limits for this film  
however , it'd be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou's outrage to full feature-length , and it's as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel  
the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever , the film's tempo loses its liveliness , the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion , and several sequences fall flat  
subtle and not-quite-subtle allusions are made ( a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall ) , and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale  
one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla  
two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter , long-running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene -- contractually-obligated to deliver an r-rated film , mr  toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled-down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc-17 rating in favour of an r -- and while admittedly titillating , the net effect of the vignette on the film's thematic narrative is rather dubious  
if anything , two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr  downey jr  , whose versatility is put to the test in this film  
he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled , from self-assured to disconcerted , yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered  
it's a wonderful performance in a role custom-tailored for him ; mr  toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr  downey jr  was arrested on drug charges , and it's hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character -- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection , blake's self-chiding to "" get [his] shit together "" is disquieting in its resonance  
while mr  downey jr  's showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film , both actresses are solid in more broadly-observed roles  
ms  graham is quickly becoming one of america's more daring actresses , involving herself in three successive risky projects -- two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank , while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman  
she's quite appealing here , playing a character at once both dainty and sultry  
meanwhile , ms  gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying , or , like me , endearing  
she tones it down substantially as the film progresses , but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox  
the film was reportedly shot in eleven days , filmed mostly in sequence , and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout  
two girls and a guy has an agile , spontaneous sort of feel , and one senses that mr  toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors  
while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact , it doesn't feel constricted ; the expansive apartment setting is well-used to vary the background , and mr  toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner  
two girls and a guy falls short of its potential , but thanks to some stellar work by mr  downey jr "

1,"plot : a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side  
but this new guy is not like all the others , he's got ambition , he's got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster  
violence , lots of swearing and betrayals ensue  
critique : a very good , serious-minded , unique british gangster flick which misses the "" great "" mark by way of an annoying voice-over popping up throughout the film and a so-so ending  
here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix  
okay , so it's not entirely new , but it's definitely original when all put together as done here  
the thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place  
it's 1968 and these dudes are looking good ! 
yes , it's all about the suits , fellas    the 
italian shoes , the cufflinks , the ties and the birds ( that's ladies , for those uninitiated ) hanging around you  
here are a bunch of horrible men , gangsters if you will , looking sharp , talking shit and busting heads all over the place  
but that's not the basis of this movie  
the basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group , the excellent david thewlis , and one of his cronies , paul bettany , also extremely good in this film , and how the power , sex appeal and coolness of one , affects the other  
you know how there are always these "" hanger-on "" gangster types who latch on to the godfathers , the leaders , the top dogs of every crime organization ? 
well , most of the time , these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person    that 
is , their boss  
so all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence  
but this film brings the betrayals , the messed up loyalties , the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package  
of course , director paul mcguigan isn't trying to be guy ritchie here , and doesn't over-stylize his presentation , jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix  
nope , he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this  
the first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he's attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty ! 
 ( "" look into my eyes ! "" ) 
in fact , the last time that i've seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers' miller's crossing  
scary shite  
but there's an ever better scene than that in this film  
this one features bettany , once again , slowly torturing , hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster ( from that man's point-of-view ) , but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes , one by one ( that's right , he "" does "" the guy in his underwear )  
that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film , especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss ( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman ? )  
but the flick's not perfect  
in fact , i didn't mind malcolm mcdowell's voice-over narration at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) , he came in every now and then , and rarely added anything of interest to the plot  
all he seemed to do was swear and call people the c-word umpteen times , and even described one scene as it was happening ( ""    so 
i opened the door , then went up the lift , etc     "" -it's 
like , yeah , i know that already , i could see it on the screen ! ! 
overdone  )  
i also didn't quite "" buy "" the ending of the movie , which despite being original , seemed a little unbelievable , especially when you consider that it's supposed to be taking place 30 years later , and folks still seem to be holding grudges , still in love , still living in the same apartments ? ? ! ? 
i mean , c'mon    it's 30 years , man ! ! 
i don't know , somehow it didn't work all that well for me  
but one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies , and this one is a decent addition to the lot  
forget the lame title and malcolm mcdowell's narration of the obvious plot points , and concentrate on the film's stronger attributes such as its style , the exquisite atmosphere of the time period , its original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group , its memorable sequences and the solid performances from its two main leads , bettany and thewlis  
incidentally , unlike a few of the gangster flicks that i mention below , this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films    it's the real deal ! 
note : this film is packed with strong accents all around , which makes it hard to make out some of the words from time to time  
it's also quite violent and i don't remember any film that used the c-word as much as this one , so leave the kids at home for this one   "

1,"finding the courage to face life full-on is a difficult task  
summoning up the audacity to fall in love is a harder job  
if you're a total jerk like melvin udall is , the odds are even more against you  
melvin ( jack nicholson ) is a successful romance author who is just the opposite of what you would expect someone in that profession to be  
a solitary man hidden away in his new york apartment with no human interaction and not even a hint of ever having been in a passionate relationship , he avoids the outside world as much as possible  
his obsessive-compulsive disorder rules his life as he uses several different bars of soap to wash his hands and refuses to step on a crack on the sidewalk  
 ( there's a great scene when he has to cross a floor made of mosaic tiles -- _very_small_ mosaic tiles  ) 
melvin has some great lines  
when his publisher's receptionist asks him how he writes women so well in his books , he responds "" i think of men and i take away reason and accountability  "" 
don't get him wrong , he's not merely a misogynist  
setting his sights higher than that , he's also a homophobe , racist , anti-semite , xenophobe , animal-hater and intensely dislikes people who talk in metaphors  
when we first meet him , he's busy dumping a neighbor's dog down the garbage chute  
he's an equal opportunity bigot  
he does venture outside his apartment every day to eat breakfast at a local cafe  
melvin is such a grouchy curmudgeon that waitress carol connelly ( helen hunt ) is the only one willing to wait on him  
and she's none too happy about it  
when carol doesn't show up for work , melvin's routine is shot and he's determined to do something about it  
tracking down her address , he shows up at her place begging her to come back to work so that he can eat breakfast  
the fact that she's a poor single mother caring for a chronically ill son doesn't appear to phase him , he wants his food  
much more upsetting is that his gay artist neighbor simon bishop ( greg kinnear ) is brutally attacked during a robbery  
this doesn't upset melvin much ( "" don't worry , you'll be back on your knees in no time "" ) but when he is bullied into taking care of simon's dog , his life is turned topsy-turvey  
melvin is sequestered because he's afraid of what's out there on the other side of his apartment door  
he has to make sure it's ritualistically locked three times to keep the world on its proper side  
when he brings the dog home he reluctantly grows fond of it , talking to it and taking it everywhere he goes  
this little crack in his emotional armor opens him up  
hiding behind his need for carol to return to work so she can serve him , he pays for a specialist to treat her son  
he even develops a friendship with simon  
all three people are heavily damaged  
melvin has retreated from life in his apartment  
carol has devoted herself to her son , convinced that she has to give up her life for him  
simon is estranged from his parents and his friends disappear when he is hospitalized and his money runs out  
a more unlikely trio to form relationships , you'd rarely see  
and in the midst of it all , there are some wonderful moments  
melvin is hilarious in his grouchiness and touching as he attempts to be nice  
 "" you make me want to be a better man , "" he tells her  
one of the best aspects is that even as he opens up , he is still a curmudgeon  
carol , afraid that his monetary contribution to the wellness of her son hides a hidden agenda rushes over to his apartment in the rain to explain in no uncertain terms that she will never sleep with him  
it only takes her a second to realize that she is delivering that statement while looking as if she just left a wet t-shirt contest  
there's hardly anything left to say about jack nicholson  
i don't remember ever seeing him in anything less than a stellar performance and his over-the-edge melvin is no disappointment  
nicholson may be the best actor working today  
hunt does a commendable job matching nicholson's energy  
she isn't afraid to be seen as something less than a babe and her portrayal of exhausted run-down carol struggling with seemingly overwhelming obligations is top-notch  
their on-screen chemistry is a bit odd  
each does a wonderful job with the character , but together , there's something a little off  
it's a minor problem : they do work well together , but that missing element is what prevents this from being a four-star film  
director james l  brooks ( "" terms of endearment "" , "" broadcast news "" ) has a movie that is picking up awards by the bucketsful ( nominees for all the top golden globes , winners from the national board of review , inevitable oscars ) and has a winner on his hands  
 "" as good as it gets "" isn't exactly the quality that the title says , but it's pretty darn close  
 ( michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and as soon as he finishes this one , he's off to an annual 12 night celebration typically held in freezing weather during a snowstorm  
this year it's in the sixties and raining "

1,"there's good news and bad news about mulan  
the positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy-handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules  
on the other hand , the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs , several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast  
but mulan is a step in the right direction and disney's best animated feature since the lion king  
after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas , disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians  
mulan is set in feudal china and features the ever-popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married  
that's what we find out when young mulan ( voice of ming- na wen ) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her  
cartoons    
meanwhile , word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns  
since mulan's a girl , that means her decrepit old father must go  
she pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad , but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family  
that's chinese culture for you    
so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father's uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place  
the movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army  
it should have been called g  i  
chang  
mulan calls on her ancestors for help  
they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her , but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up  
voiced by eddie murphy , mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges  
murphy's performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin -- lots of wisecracks and ad-libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they're going to have  
you ain't never had a friend like mushu  
speaking of songs , mulan doesn't have too many of them , which is a plus with a story like this  
disney songs about war probably wouldn't go over too well ( "" heigh ho , heigh ho , it's off to war i go    "" ) , and the ones they do have aren't memorable  
the best of the bunch , sad to say , is "" be a man , "" the requisite basic training montage song  
yes , even in medieval china , they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle  
sung by donnie osmond ( a bad sign if ever there was one ) , "" be a man "" accompanies footage of mulan's platoon going from screw-ups to heroes  
it makes me wonder , has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that's ended badly ? 
i only wish real-life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage  
for the curious , mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl  
all she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulder-length , talk macho and slap guys on the butt , as was male custom a thousand years ago in china  
the deception fools everyone but the audience , who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12-year-old boy , at best  
but she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army , led by a big , evil-eyed attilla-looking monster  
as a villain , the head of the huns is menacing , evil and entirely forgettable  
i saw the movie yesterday and i don't remember the man's name  
otherwise , mulan is a good movie  
the animation of the characters themselves isn't as rich as it could and should be , but there are some amazing battlefield shots  
eddie murphy pulls off some good one-liners , as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita , the quintessential asian movie star  
hell , george "" mr  sulu "" takei does a voice in mulan  
you get the sense disney said to themselves , "" alright , let's get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood  
who can you think of ? "" 
 "" well , there's mr  myagi   "

1,"george little ( jonathan lipnicki ) wants a little brother  
after mr  and mrs  little ( hugh laurie and geena davis ) visit the orphange , they decide to adopt stuart , a talking mouse ( voiced by michael j  fox )  
george isn't so fond of his new brother when stuart arrives at the little house , and neither is snowbell the family cat ( voiced by nathan lane )  
george and stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race , but snowbell wants stuart out of the house ( he's unable to live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying it's ridiculous that a mouse has a pet cat )  
stuart little is a mix of live action and computer generated imagery ( cgi )  
the character of stuart , while obviously a computer generated image , grows on you as the film progresses and you'll soon see him as much more than a mere special effect  
there is also a great deal of animal training involved with this film , as many of the "" supporting cast "" are actual cats ( with computer animated mouths so they can speak )  
it's fascinating to watch these cats give performances without an actual mouse to interact with  
stuart little is a charming family film  
there are some great laughs in the movie ( with a script co-written by the sixth sense's m  night shyamalan no less ! ) , 
some moments that can only be described as "" too cute "" ( the boat race sequence is what won me over ) and even the majority of the one-liners ( common nowadays in children's films or films featuring nathan lane ) are tolerable  
kids and parents will love this one  
stuart little is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video  
there are two different dvds on sale : one contains the film in full frame , and the other presents the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1  66 : 1  
both versions feature choices of either dolby surround or dolby digital 5  1 audio  
both versions also contain the following extras ( and hang in there with me here    there's a lot of them ) : a full length audio commentary track by director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson , a full length audio commentary track by the visual effects supervisors , an isolated score track , an interactive trivia game , an interactive featurette that goes step by step through eight of the effects in the film , a making of documentary that originally aried on hbo , and a stuart little read-along story ( which you can read yourself or have stuart read for you )  
there are also three music videos , and six theatrical trailers ( called thecatrical trailers    
get it ? 
it's funny ! ) for stuart little and five other columbia tristar releases : the adventures of elmo in grouchland , madeline , the nuttiest nutcracker , muppets from space , and baby geniuses ( the only bad thing about this entire dvd    
i did not want to be reminded of the awfulness that is baby geniuses )  
dvd-rom features are also on the disc , including web links and a demo of the stuart little cd-rom game  
but wait    
there's still more ! 
there's a section called "" basement treasures "" where you will find the auditions of the film's animators , six deleted scenes which you can select to view with or without commentary from the director , a visual effects gag reel , a production gag reel , and an incredible eight minute storyboard sequence detailing the original concept for the boat race scene ( with commentary from the director )  
the first commentary track features director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson  
they give insightful and detailed thoughts about the film's production  
minkoff likes to point out scenes where other screenwriters came in and polished up the script , namely writers like scott alexander and larry karaszewski ( who wrote the people vs  larry flynt and ed wood ) and lowell ganz and babaloo mandel ( who wrote splash and multiplicity , among others )  
anderson is very appreciative of the animators who worked with him and often points out which animator worked on each scene as they occur  
the second commentary track features visual effects supervisors john dykstra and jerome chen who discuss more specific details of the effects in the film  
movie fans will enjoy the informative first commentary track , serious animation buffs will love the second one  
now i know this is slightly off topic , but it is related specifically to this dvd so i must voice this now  
one of the music videos on the disc is for a song called "" i need to know "" by a group called r angels  
this video features four mid-teenage girls ( the singers obviously ) having a slumber party  
the girls ask a ouija board "" i need to know    
who to do , who to do , who to do "" as the song begins  
they then sneak out of their house , and along the way they strike a pose and their slumber party pajamas are magically transformed into middle class streetwalker outfits "
1," "" you'll go ape over tarzan because it's more fun than a barrel of monkeys ! "" 
okay , there's the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie  
disney's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship  
father , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson  
it's amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack  
before you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard  
against the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own  
tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild  
much of tarzan's young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his "" father , "" which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his attempts  
all he's looking for is acceptance , perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers , but one which will ring true with a lot of adults  
when you really think about it , this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end  
look back on past disney animated features and you'll see the trend  
growing up , tarzan ( voiced by alex d  linz as a child , and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends  
one is an ape named terk ( rosie o'donnell ) , and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight )  
both provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold  
i'm beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films  
just fill in the blanks ! 
can you see it ? 
 "" now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it  
we've already had a fish and a crab , and we've had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues     have 
we had an ape and an elephant yet ? 
well , there we go ! "" 
of course , there's gotta be romance somewhere along the line , so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through  
together with her father dr  porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa  
she discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately , and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory "" you tarzan , me jane "" scene  
thankfully , those aren't the exact words  
however , i found it distracting that tarzan is going "" ohh ohh ee ee "" one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction  
how does he tell his name to another ape ? 
 "" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? "" 
well , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable  
but hey , tarzan's a young adult  
do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ? 
isn't that illegal in most countries ? 
oh , well  
i don't think disney will be using my quote anymore  
tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical  
there's lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time  
we instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material  
this isn't really a bad thing , as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it's just different  
do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie  
with each new feature , disney animation gets even better  
not necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan  
there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying  
the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this isn't just tarzan , it's "" extreme tarzan  "" 
however , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its "" chandelier scene , "" which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking  
lasting but a few seconds at most , it's been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail  
as usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters  
the one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o'donnell  
going into the film , i didn't know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately  
her performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , "" that's no boy ape , that rosie o'donnell  "" 
distracting to say the least  
i'll admit i've never read the edgar rice burroughs story "" tarzan of the apes , "" so i couldn't tell you how true this film stays to the book  
but unless you're a purist , you should have few objections to this film  
with solid performances , action , adventure , a bit of romance , and great music and animation , tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us  
note : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago , i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie-ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature "

1,"in the wake of the smashing success of "" rumble in the bronx , "" it's looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release  
rumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii  
the version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it's widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days  
availability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng  
the subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small  
although the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you're reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it  
to be fair , i must admit that i've never been very fond of "" period-piece "" martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past  
perhaps it's because most of those i've seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it's because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant  
in fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end  
or , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc  ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts  
having said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i've seen , and i quite enjoyed it  
surprised ? 
well , so was i  
drunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu  
where he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong's practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu  
apparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i've heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i'll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better  
one of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the "" once upon a time in china "" movies , but i have not yet seen those  
the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you're watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren't expecting something on the order of "" war and peace ""  
the story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china's cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill  
however , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong's perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs  
the macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners  
in the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer  
in the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng  
after fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general's son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng  
and so it goes  
and the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong's girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i've already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves  
let's move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies    the 
action  
there's plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie    of 
course , in a kung fu film , that's to be expected  
however , this isn't just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius  
the primary martial arts "" style "" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk  
further , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated    but 
there's a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor  
under normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair  
the kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i'll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching  
another thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work  
even without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film  
among other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits )  
 ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database  ) 
unlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked  
drunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( "" a better tomorrow "" 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the "" heroic trio "" series , "" rumble in the bronx "" )  
the performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film  
the scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong's father's back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong's mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband's anger away from fei-hong )  
jackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he's in fine form all through drunken master ii "

1,"warning : this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film "" fail-safe  "" 
if you haven't seen the film yet , proceed with caution  
nutshell : a relevant , intelligent , suspenseful drama  
still powerful today , even after the end of the cold war  
-------------------- "" fail-safe "" ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes 
screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e  youngstein directed by sidney lumet 
review by jamahl epsicokhan -------------------- 
the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn't have a winning side and a losing side  
in a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world--assuming the world survives  
the idea--and perhaps the only real option--is to avoid war at all costs  
this is the theme of sidney lumet's "" fail-safe , "" a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler  
 "" fail-safe "" takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism  
the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws  
five u  s  bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america  
the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers  
suddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike  
a great deal of "" fail-safe "" 's plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u  s  bombers from reaching russia's borders--at any cost  
the plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios  
the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails  
general bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable  
the events in "" fail-safe "" are fascinating because they're anything but predictable , but the real reason "" fail-safe "" works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot  
a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states' role in all of it  
most of this is through the film's use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president's advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war  
many of the film's most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices  
early in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of "" strategy "" in a nuclear assault to "" minimize "" casualties  
 "" what's the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? "" 
a guest asks impatiently  
 "" forty million , "" groeteschele responds wryly  
the problem with groeteschele's mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war  
the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals  
groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over  
yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o'herlihy ) has often recommended  
on the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u  s  , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage  
such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race  
 "" fail-safe "" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film  
why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ? 
is it wise ? 
is it even logical ? 
no , not really  
although "" fail-safe "" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way  
again , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film's most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance  
in addition to providing the central "" pro-nuclear war "" voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism  
the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib  
one of groeteschele's "" logical "" trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it's merely absurd  
he labels the average marxist an "" unfeeling , calculating machine "" that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself  
groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u  s  drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia's home soil--which must be preserved at all costs  
groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would  
the irony here is groeteschele's own mechanical theorizing  
he is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn't even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns "

1,"director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one )  
film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story , but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something  
but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story  
so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential , the film almost automatically deserves a good review  
and when they add a fascinating story to it , you have nearly perfect entertainment  
fincher's the game is no exception to this  
the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time  
fincher hasn't made a film since "" seven , "" his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever  
so it is about time he made another film  
and what a ride it is  
the game isn't quite as powerful as "" seven , "" but in some ways it is better  
overall , the game could have used a little more clarity , or a little more uncertainty  
it walks a line of insanity and reality , but it never goes either way until the very end  
the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events , and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight  
unfortunately , unlike "" the usual suspects , "" we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening , whether it be true or false  
however , this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent  
the game is told completely from its main character's point of view  
nicholas van orton ( michael douglas ) is a high-strung and isolated businessman  
he lives alone in his giant mansion , divorced from his wife elizabeth , and is celebrating his 48th birthday ; the same age at which his father committed suicide at , in the same mansion  
for his 48th birthday , conrad ( sean penn ) , the rebel of the family , gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs : consumer recreation services  
 "" it will make your life fun again , "" his brother promises  
as skeptical as nicholas is , he is somewhat intrigued , and annoyed by the lack of information--something this businessman hates  
seeing a billboard in an office , he decides to visit the mysterious company  
jim feingold ( james rebhorn ) greets nicholas and guides him through the sign-up process , which consists of psych-tests , physicals , emotional responses , and other mind games  
 "" each game is suited to each person's emotional and psychological needs , "" explains feingold  
one day , nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests  
even more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up , he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company  
what he doesn't realize is that the game has already begun  
the phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas' way  
how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive  
the detail involved in fincher's shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them  
with "" seven , "" fincher had almost every single shot mean something  
he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to  
compared to "" seven , "" though , the game is light and comical  
because of this film's sense of humor and self-awareness , nothing can be taken quite seriously  
so don't try to make much sense of what goes on in the game , because it doesn't want you to  
what does make sense is the final revelation--when everything becomes apparent and clear  
if taken as it is , the game's ending makes complete sense  
but if you try and critique every minute detail , then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility  
perhaps that is the reason i docked the film  
while trying to remain realistic and plausible , the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen  
we don't really care if douglas' character lives or not because it isn't believable  
the ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously , but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is , you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller  
michael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas  
douglas has played lonely businessmen before , but here he adds another level to his performance  
his character , who is normally level-headed and relies on facts , is forced to trust nobody  
can he believe the waitress he bumped into ? 
what about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place ? 
douglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well , and gives one of his best performances ( even better than his "" falling down "" persona )  
the supporting cast is essential in this film , and casting was critical  
sean penn is always good , and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas' brother  
deborah kara unger ( from "" crash "" ) is the waitress he bumps into , and her performance is extremely good  
in fact , she almost steals the film from douglas "
1,"a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal  
a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another  
a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain  
a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end  
if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues  
it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label  
edward zwick's the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states  
you'd think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines  
arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u  s  responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack  
however , unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden's camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal  
in retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world  
unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau's new york office at one federal plaza  
while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information  
generally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u  s  , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm  
even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country  
hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government  
the original tagline for patriot games was , "" there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil  "" 
however true , it was pulled before the movie's release because it sounded too much like a dare  
revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america  
admittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who's going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two-thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid  
i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare of good guy g-men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order  
it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab-american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself  
in fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk  
although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups  
throughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully  
what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides  
it actually gets rather heady at times , but it's a credit to screenwriters zwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they don't underestimate the intelligence of the audience  
i don't know if it's his tone or inflection or something else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great  
this , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid-level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable  
annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i've seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable  
it's somewhat unfortunate that her character's fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range  
bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough-guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face  
however , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film's development  
notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant  
the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society  
difficult to say the least , shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch  
perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom "" wings , "" shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night  
whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick's favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) , james horner seems to be his favorite composer  
i therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score-writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian-themed music , and horner's record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish-sounding at most  
revell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole  
it's nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we've been getting throughout the year  
missteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes  
for example , it's pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick  
unfortunately , there's a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions , obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye-catching  
in the middle of the city ( and against no real opposition ) , zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops  
verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point  
the film also gets a little preachy toward the end , focusing on the ability of different races to get along "

1,"roman emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) chooses his trusted general maximus ( russell crowe ) as his successor  
however the emperor's evil son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) murders his father before the announcement can be made , and maximus ( as well as his family ) is sentenced to be executed  
maximus is able to escape his executioners , but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo ( oliver reed )  
proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money ( he being a former gladiator himself ) , and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator  
when emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum , proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle  
maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus  
gladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania , and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required "" 40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence "" style of moviemaking  
the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used    
it's choppy slow-motion which is unsettling and distracting  
it's similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan , but nowhere near as effective  
the actual gladiator battles are thrilling , but also a bit disjointed  
many times it's unclear as to exactly what's going on    
all the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled  
we're not sure who's blood or by who's hand though  
there's an instance of this earlier in the film too that's disappointing  
it's comes when maximus escapes his executioners  
some flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free    
but i still don't know exactly how he did it  
russell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995's virtuosity  
for whatever reason his stardom never arrived    
but he should have it now  
from here on moviegoers should now be able to say , "" let's go see the new russell crowe movie ""  
he gets the best scene in the film ( and one of the best moments of all recent movies ) when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum  
it's both rousing and chilling  
joaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person and not just a cartoon character ( which could have easily happened )  
commodus is conniving , sneaky and whiny , but phoenix never lets the character get silly  
it's a very good ( and very creepy ) performance  
oliver reed died during the filming of gladiator , and it's a huge loss to the acting world  
i've always been fascinated with reed    
he's one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years  
it's ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again , as he gives a fun and sincere performance  
the film is dedicated to him , and he will surely be missed  
reed's death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem , as he still had scenes to be completed  
rather than recast the role ( and end up reshooting a great deal of footage ) , a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of 2 million dollars  
ironically , that was probably more money than reed ever earned for a single film  
anyway , this digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of ( for about twenty seconds ) and if you aren't looking for it you won't even be able to tell  
some of the other digital effects are less convincing however    
and like i always say , noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately  
it's sad that such a good film has these distractions "

1,"as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it , the more pleased i was when i left  
first , getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz : "" if you liked scream , you'll love wild things ! "" 
 "" campbell gives a stunning performance ! "" 
 "" this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days ! "" 
 ( oh yeah , the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me ) 
now , onto more serious stuff ( and with this film , i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way )  
wild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa  
i'm not saying that in a bad way , but when you see this film , you may be shocked by what you see  
however , perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film's charming cast and tricky plot , that they let the film slide with an r rating  
being mormon , i'm bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film  
trouble is , i have already seen it  
and i like it ! 
wild things is a film noir of the 90s , filled with 40s sensibilities , and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture  
the style in which it is filmed is rich in color  
the actors are all gorgeous people , seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film  
sure , it's all too good to be true , but ain't it fun to watch ? 
when movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it  
there will be people who don't want to admit liking what they see , but i tell you , most anyone who sees this will like it  
wild things begins at blue bay high school , the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into  
it's almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone )  
of course , there are those select few who may look slightly ugly , but compared to the average person , they are gorgeous  
immediately , the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time  
we can turn off our brains , right ? 
wrong  
while you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn't turn out that way  
the film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present  
there's sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students  
he's heading the class discussion  
there's also kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam  
teaching the class , however , are two policemen : ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) , who want to talk about 'sex    
 ( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) '  
 "" what is a sex crime ? "" 
ray asks  
 "" not gettin' any ! "" 
one student responds  
this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch  
however , upon hearing this , one student , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , stands up and leaves the room , commenting that they can both kiss part of her body  
and so , wild things sets into motion  
quickly , kelly begins hitting on sam , but sam doesn't want anything to do with her advances  
kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him  
she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep  
surprisingly , that's really all i can tell you about the plot  
any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists  
and what's more , these plot twists are actually unpredictable  
going along the way of scream , wild things maintains that film's surprises , and then adds even more to them  
there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen  
and even though you think you may get tired of them , the surprises are so genuine that it's rather pleasing  
going back over them in my mind , nearly all of them work , though some stretch the boundaries of belief  
thankfully , the convoluted plot doesn't give us much time to think about each one , pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off  
as for the critics who complain that the film is trashy--well , it is  
this is pretty much just one trashy film  
however , it is the kind of trashy that isn't hard to watch  
it's good trash , in a sense  
one , the screenplay knows that it's not to be taken seriously , and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story  
this varies everywhere from kelly's mother ( theresa russell ) , who is more of a caricature of rich people , all the way to an ambulance-chasing lawyer ( bill murray ) , who wears a neck-brace to cover an insurance scam he is running  
bill murray also provides the best character in the film , and most of the genuine laughs  
and two , the sex is more than gratuitous , although not unwelcomed  
wild things is supposed to have sex in it ( what film with that title wouldn't ? ) , and this movie breaks the boundaries "

1,"since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they're portraying , it's fitting to say that "" beloved "" come as a real shock as a film  
it's confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i've seen all year , and that's not necessarily because of the three-hour running time  
 "" beloved "" is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , "" beloved "" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based )  
 "" beloved "" tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children  
when the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family  
sethe is proud , though , and will not move  
her sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation  
a couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging  
he has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot  
when he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies "" it ain't evil  
it's just sad  "" 
some more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears  
but when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house  
her name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills  
she stumbles around , half-grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk  
they let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down  
 "" beloved "" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story  
most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low-lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day psychoanalysts  
sethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , "" they took my milk ! "" 
worst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back  
she runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don't leave them alone  
when she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film , she says she doesn't regret it  
she killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did , and she has convinced herself she did the right thing  
of course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we aren't flat out told that until later on in the film  
beloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long  
thus , "" beloved "" becomes a sorta-redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci-fi classic , "" solaris , "" where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife , who commited suicide years before , has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system  
that film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories , how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past , and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us , it would control us completely  
 "" beloved "" moves along freely , without a lot of explanation , and for the most part , this is extremely respectable  
the most interesting films are the ones that don't explain everything for us , leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense  
sethe is never fully explained as a character , but we understand all her actions since she's being played by oprah winfrey  
it's been well over a decade since her last major performance in "" the color purple , "" but judging from these two films , i'll bet she's one of the best actresses working today    if 
she was strictly an actress  
her talk show , which i suppose is a great entity , has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress , and that's a shame because she brings so much to this movie  
emotion  
sadness  
strength  
watching the strong sethe , who's so afraid of the past that she's built a rather strong protective coating around herself , break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great  
she makes it real  
that's not to say this is a perfect film  
in fact , i'd wager to say that the fact that it's confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is  
while oprah's performance is powerful and easily sympathetic ( and i'm dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february ) , the structure of the film , which doesn't show what happened to her children till halfway through the film , prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film  
it doesn't necessarily move as though they're memories of one particular character , and by the end , it has lost control over sethe , and as she takes to bed , we are unable to truly identify with her anymore  
but despite its tediousness , perhaps that's the point  
the distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start , since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable , and it needs to get back with reality  
and for the most part , this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be  
jonathan demme's direction is bizarre , in nature with the story , and he creates the right mood , making it a tough film to sit through , making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters  
there's more to admire here , like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization , just like they would be in real life ; and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering , but laced with a touch of optimism  
the acting , not only from winfrey , is amazing , and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination  
everyone has been raving about thandie newton's performance , and how it should be rewarded  
however , it must be noted that out of everyone , she had the easiest part "
1,"books could be , and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy , and rightfully so  
this is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70s/early 80s , inspiring literally dozens of clones , from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day , and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre  
the special effects were groundbreaking , revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later  
literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it  
and now , george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy  
much has been and is still being made of the fact that mr  lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now  
some fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection , while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday's star wars updated with today's special effects wizardry  
either way , the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen , where it rightfully deserves to be seen  
can there be anyone in the world who doesn't know what star wars is about ? 
in a way , star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it  
it's a story about a young man's coming of age , a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire , a tale of swashbuckling and derring-do the likes of which haven't been seen on the silver screen in decades , strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn , and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world  
it's high adventure , incredible special effects , and    well , it's just an _experience_  
something about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation    and 
it's about to do so again  
this new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film's devoted fans , who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now  
interviews , trailers , leaks from within lucasfilm    all of these have been collected , collated , and placed on webpages for people to see ( pages such as http : //www  islandnet  com/~corona/films/details/sw4  html 
or , my personal favorite , http : //leopard  cs  latrobe  edu  au/~koukoula/ 
 )  
pictures of before and after have been placed side by side    even 
months before the movies were released , fans were making comparisons  
in some cases , the changes were nothing less than phenomenal , and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater  
the digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here , unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original  
for instance , in my personal favorite example , the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep , moss-covered carvings and etchings  
and mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling , booming city , with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing  
all the starships and fighters are now computer-animated , getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally made--and they look _fantastic_  
four and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added , including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply couldn't do it justice  
however , much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself  
the negatives , badly damaged by the ravages of time , were brightened and returned to their original splendor  
the audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed , with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt , into glorious , booming , theater-shaking full-thx dolby digital stereo  
and _that_ , more than the added scenes or new special effects , is where the real value of this new version lies  
it's really true what they say in the commercials : star wars loses _so much_ on the small screen  
even letterboxing doesn't make up for the decrease in size and definition  
in regard to the star wars special edition , and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yet to be released , i'll make this final recommendation : go and see it  
go and see it more than once   "

be forewarned  
like its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent  
a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking  
the film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop  
as boogie nights opens , he's toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity  
recruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar  
wholeheartedly embraced by jack's troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c  reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his "" one special thing "" are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a "" big bright shining star ""  
his lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in  
the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr  anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious  
from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr  anderson's accomplished command of the camera is without question  
while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco's unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr  anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent  
it's a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker's career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it's somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he's clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he's borrowing from some of the best , and it's entirely effective within the context of this film  
while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it's also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour  
the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre-aids-scare period in american history where uninhibited , free-wheeling lifestyles abounded  
while much of the film's humour pertains to the characters' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope's demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get 'freaky deaky' with the music -- it's elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous  
a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie/dirk's bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking  
ably supported by a well-selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr  anderson's personal collection ) , there's a clear affection for the era in boogie nights  
it's the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film's promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters  
after the debacle with 1996's milos forman film , the people vs  
larry flynt , another finely-crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography-related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public  
however , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it's hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there's very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business  
the glimpses on the sets of jack horner's shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there's a candid matter-of-factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it's refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided  
if anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves  
jack horner's dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence )  
in both films , the world of quickie low-budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack's retort of "" there are shadows in light , baby "" to his cinematographer's complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood's "" it's not about the little details , it's about the big picture ! "" 
rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false  
in boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there's nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an 'artistic' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark  
much like the humour lacing ed wood , the laughs involving jack horner are double-edged ; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres , when jack breathes "" this is the best work i've ever done "" , it's genuinely funny , but given his utter sincerity , also possesses a tinge of sadness  
mr  anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter  
while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn't any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film's characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film's * protagonist * literally doesn't say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it's no wonder why the playfully inane "" how much can you bench ? "" 
banter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film's finest exchanges  
and while mr  anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it's problematic that some of the the threads given to the film's characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore's child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv-movie version of her character's story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions  
still , even if he doesn't always know what to do with his characters , mr  anderson most definitely captures their essences , and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious -- misguided , even aimless , hopelessly naive , self-destructive , insufferable : i loved them just the same  
in any case , it's hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired ( and ultimately best-executed ) scenes of the year : a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose-cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson ( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance , even if it's a small one ) in a suicidal drug deal scam , only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric ( the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger's "" sister christian "" on his stereo system is sheer brilliance ) flanked by an armed bodyguard  
if this scene already wasn't tense enough with these elements , mr  anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene , who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room , pushing the scene to a new , surreal level of delightful giddiness  
there are some other interesting touches in boogie nights  
mr  anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight ; here , it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect  
similarly , a painful scene where crew member scotty j ( philip seymour hoffman ) breaks down in tears in the driver's seat , sobbing "" i'm so stupid "" after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver's seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening  
boogie nights is exceedingly well cast , and each of the actors rise to the occasion ; the ensemble cast is uniformly good  
while most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr  wahlberg ( fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films ) and mr  reynolds ( terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film , ringing true in every respect ) , a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention "

1,"here's a word analogy : amistad is to the lost world as schindler's list is to jurassic park  
in 1993 , after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit , many critics described schindler's list as the director's "" penance "" ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster )  
now , after a three-year layoff , spielberg is back with a vengeance  
once again , his summer release was special effects-loaded action/adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers  
now , following his 1993 pattern , he has fashioned another serious , inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity  
that film is amistad  
although not as masterful as schindler's list , amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture  
thematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact  
watching schindler's list was a powerful , almost spiritual , experience  
spielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three-plus hours later  
aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since  
amistad , while a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent  
the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that's not a surprise  
however , the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric , and , while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account , most of the basic facts are in order  
several , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film's dramatic force  
on the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired  
one stormy night during the summer of 1839 , the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape  
led by the lion-hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , they take control of the vessel , killing most of the crew  
adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa , they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey  
they are tricked , however , and the la amistad , which makes its way northward off the united states' eastern coastline , is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut  
the kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison , charged with murder and piracy  
the first men to come to the africans' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard )  
they are soon joined by roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a property attorney of little repute  
aided by advice from former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) , baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for , and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men , not property -- convinces the judge  
but powerful forces have aligned against baldwin's cause  
current president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , eager to please southern voters and 11-year old queen isabella of spain ( anna paquin ) , begins pulling strings behind-the-scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free  
at its heart , amistad is a tale of human courage  
cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to  
he is a free man , not a slave , and , while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle , he will not give it up  
effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou , whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention , cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies  
they are individuals , and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie's success  
to amplify this point , spielberg presents many scenes from the africans' point-of-view , detailing their occasionally-humorous observations about some of the white man's seemingly-strange "" rituals ""  
the larger struggle is , of course , one of defining humanity  
as the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as "" sub-human , "" so the pro-slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense  
the abolitionists regard the africans as men , but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property  
in a sense , the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war , which would break out less than three decades later , looming over everything  
amistad's presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating , making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history  
four claimants come forward against the africans : the state , which wants them tried for murder ; the queen of spain , who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an american/spanish treaty ; two american naval officers , who claim the right of high seas salvage ; and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad , who demand that their property be returned to them  
baldwin must counter all of these claims , while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque  
even though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier , they gradually learn to communicate  
aside from cinque , who is a fully-realized individual , characterization is spotty , but the acting is top-notch  
matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his "" pretty boy "" image to become baldwin , but the lawyer is never particularly well-defined outside of his role in the la amistad case  
likewise , while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan , they are never anything more than "" abolitionists  "" 
nigel hawthorne , who played the title character in the madness of king george , presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election  
finally , there's anthony hopkins , whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done  
hopkins , who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer , an emotionally-crippled english butler , and richard nixon , makes us believe that he is adams  
his ten-minute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable  
one point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler's list is this film's lack of a well-defined human villain  
schindler's list had ralph fiennes' superbly-realized amon goeth , who was not only a three-dimensional character , but a personification of all that the nazis stood for  
there is no such figure in amistad  
the villain is slavery , but an ideology , no matter how evil , is rarely the best adversary "

1,"cinema has been around for about a hundred years now  ? 
it's not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film , but i'd like to think that i'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time  
recently , i've seen the films of hitchcock , capra , fellini , godard , kurosawa , chaplin , lang , and many others  
 ? those men were talented artists , and their films reflect their genius  ? 
they are likely to be remembered for  
  
  
well , quite a while  ? 
i like this film , too  ? 
yes , it's a disaster-slash-action movie  ? 
true , its budget is a lot more money than i'll ever see in my lifetime  ? 
and there's not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money  ? 
in fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would've been more profitable  
i certainly don't care what their intentions were , because michael bay ( the rock ) is such a skilled director that i doubt he'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through  
of course , skillful direction doesn't complete the package , but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together  
the story is well-thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) , the acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters  
yes , you read that right  
armageddon actually has characters you can care about ! 
if you don't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be  
if you've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story  
it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film  
so , it's up to the u  s  government to stop it  
 ( why the u  s  is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated  ) 
their plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within  
the head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis )  
his group of men is a colorful bunch , including a  j  
 ( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi )  
there's also an interesting triangle formed between a  j  , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry's daughter  
a  j  
and grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad isn't too happy with the situation  
it's absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you'd like to call armageddon  
it's not about story -- it's about viscera and action , and thrills-a-minute , and all that stuff  
it's incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds' thought to what actually happens  
but bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better  
i think most of the budget went to cameras alone , because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles  
take the spectacular opening scene , for instance , in which a meteor shower obliterates new york  
a meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building , which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars  
the action itself might take five seconds in real life , but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways  
i like his quick-edit style , because it's abrasive and exhausting to watch  
it's also very loud , and obnoxiously noisy at times  
but it's fun to be obnoxious sometimes  
the special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame  
deep impact , visually , has absolutely nothing on armageddon , and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable  
special effects are very important in a film like this : if they're not good , then the image is not convincing , and the film doesn't work "

1,"with the release of gattaca , i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens , or aliens in general  
hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films , but what was usually lacking was a good story    
and good characters    
and good acting , etc ( contact being the exception )  
and for some reason , hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth  
the closest , that i have seen anyway , was 2001 : a space odyssey , which made mankind an alien race themselves , being dwarfed by the technology which they created  
now comes gattaca , another film about technology reigning supreme , except here on our planet  
the difference between 2001 and this one is simple : gattaca is more frightening  
most of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering  
using this premise , writer/director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills  
unfortunately , due to a lack of advertising , i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office  
since seeing the film , i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca  
lately , however , i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca  
most people don't even realize that it is a film  
despite this fact , i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it  
niccol's film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter , better produced , and more realistic  
gattaca begins in the 21st century  
procreating is now done in a petri dish , and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it  
natural child birth is considered old-fashioned  
we are introduced to jerome morrow ( ethan hawke ) , an employee of the gattaca space program  
one of the directors of the program has been murdered , and the main suspect is one vincent freeman  
the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman  
vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love  
however , after his birth , and through several genetic tests , doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99% chance of a weak heart , as well as poor eye sight and a short life span  
as a result , both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics  
anton ( loren dean ) is produced without flaws , and the competition between brothers spawns  
vincent has a dream to fly a solo-flight around the titan , the 14th moon of saturn , but because of his condition , gattaca , and society in general , forces him to do menial labor around the company  
labeled an "" in-valid , "" vincent's dream seems impossible , until he meets a black-market dna specialist , german ( tony shalhoub )  
german introduces him to a "" valid "" who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident  
jerome morrow ( jude law ) agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools ( urine , blood , skin and hair samples , etc  ) that he will need to get past gattaca's tight security  
in exchange , vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship  
after the murder , however , his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincent's eyelashes left at the scene of the crime  
irene cassini ( uma thurman ) is a genetically flawed "" valid "" working for gattaca , and she begins to fall in love with vincent/jerome  
gattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time  
only two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years ( contact and the arrival ) and gattaca will rank among them  
unfortunately , whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effects-laden films , it normally gets buried  
the second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs  
the orange glow of gattaca's scenes are impressive , but the sets deserve most of the credit  
the sets are very well done , creating a futuristic sense , but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers  
as we look at the designs , we realize that these buildings aren't too far into the future  
this brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day  
the best thing , however , is the plot  
the story is more than your average sci-fi/thriller  
at its heart , it develops a theme which is never overpowering but is always present  
perhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring  
would our society become a bunch of soulless zombies ? 
maybe human nature is a result of mankind's flaws "

rated pg-13 for mild language , adult situations , drug use , martial art action and violence  
107 minutes  
super 35mm / panavision ( 2  35 : 1 ) 
what can you say about jackie chan that hasn't already been said  
since the release of 'rumble in the bronx "" back in 1996 ( the u  s  release ) , jackie has become a fairly recognizable commodity on america's video shelves  
having made over 80 films , jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of action-comedy to the west  
his latest release , "" shanghai noon "" , is a joyful tribute / spoof of the classic western  
and by adding jackie chan into the genre , the tag line for the film ( "" the western gets a kick in the pants "" ) rings true  
jackie stars as chon wang , a lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china  
the royal princess pei pei ( lucy liu ) is set to be married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture  
unwilling to follow her father's wishes , princess pei pei with the assistance of her english tutor , decides to escape to america  
but this is all a ploy devised by exiled guard lo fong , which will lead to the princess' kidnapping and ransom  
unable to take any legal action , the ransom demands are met and three of the forbidden city's bravest guards ( played by cui ya hi , rong guang yu , and eric chen ) are ordered to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson city , nevada  
chon wang pleads with the imperial court and is given permission to join the team , as he is looked upon as a buffoon  
on a train in the u  s  jackie meets up with bandit roy o'bannon ( owen wilson )  
he is much less of a bandit than he is a glory hog , looking simple for the notoriety and fame that being a bandit will bring him  
with his gang in tow , roy attempts to rob the train , when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court , who also happens to be chon wang's uncle  
chon wang gives chase , foiling the attempted robbery , but also leaving himself stranded in the desert  
as the disgraced guard wanders through the desert , he again comes upon roy , who has been left for dead by his former gang  
buried up to his neck in the desert , roy pleads with chon to dig him out  
chon demands to know where carson city is  
roy directs him , and chon leaves  
but not before sticking two chopsticks into roy's mouth and telling him to dig himself  
chon soon finds himself confronted by angry crow warriors , a friendly sioux tribe , gunslingers , a horse that thinks and behaves like a dog and an indian bride ( brandon merrill ) , before once again running into roy  
 "" shanghai noon "" is just good fun  
the chemistry between the cast is remarkable  
the performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film  
jackie's performance is as good as anything he's done before  
he's not called on to do much acting here , as the character is not written with any depth  
but jackie's natural charisma shines through , and his comic timing is so perfect , both physically and ( surprise ) verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on  
owen wilson , last seen in the embarrassing remake of "" the haunting "" , gives a good natured performance as roy o'bannon  
his innocence is refreshing and fun  
a bad guy that's not really bad  
his scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis  
lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script , but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant  
the character is a noble woman of status and wealth , but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment  
the rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances  
nothing here is realistic , mind you  
 "" shanghai noon "" is first and foremost a light , jovial film  
and the performances match that style with ease  
the cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous  
using calgary , alberta as the prime location  
mr  mindel is able to create a lush , romantic western feel to the film  
nothing here really looks like nevada , but the locations are so beautifully shot and staged , the film can be looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre  
and as such , the script by alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose with history , but with reverence to past films  
homage to such films as "" high noon "" ( obviously ) , "" red river "" and most notably "" butch cassidy & the sundance kid "" all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film "

1,"mike myers , you certainly did throw us a ? frickin' bone here in what you call ? the biggest austin powers adventure yet  ' 
austin powers : the spy who shagged me is the sequel to the 1997 smash comedy austin powers : international man of mystery  
many are skeptical about sequels , saying that the sequel is never better or as good as the original , but austin powers : tswsm goes beyond the first film  
austin powers : the spy who shagged me stars mike myers in three different roles  
he reprises his role as the title character , austin powers , the shagadelic spy whose body was frozen in 1967 , and unfrozen in 1997 to stop his long time nemesis dr  evil , also played by mike myers , from destroying the earth  
tswsm leaves off where the original stopped , with dr  evil's ? frisch's big boy' space capsule floating through space  
dr  evil returns back to earth by ejecting from his capsule , plotting to go back in his time machine to the year 1967 , in which he plans to steal austin powers' "" mojo "" , what keeps austin going with spy talents  
upon his return to his secret lair , which is now a starbucks coffee shop , dr  evil learns that his evil henchman , which includes the returning robert wagner as number 2 and mindy sterling as frau , have created a 1/8 size clone of dr  evil , which is later named mini me  
the evil mini me replaces scott evil , played by seth green , as dr  evil's son in the madman's mind , because dr  evil thinks of scott to be only "" quasi-evil  "" 
dr  evil has always wanted a son that is evil just like him , and now he has one  
dr  evil tells mini me , "" you complete me , "" in a loving manner  
dr  evil loving ? 
wow ! 
mike myers' third role is as fat bastard , a scottish henchman of dr  evil's , who is sent to steal the mojo from austin powers' frozen body  
austin powers learns of dr  evil's trip back into the 60s , and uses his own time machine to take him back to 1967 , to try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold of it  
once arriving in the year 1967 , austin travels to his "" pad "" , his smashing home/dance club , where he meets felicity shagwell , played by heather graham , a cia agent who is willing to help him in his journey to stop dr  evil  
as the film progresses , hilarious one liners are thrown at us , mainly by dr  evil , for example , "" don't go there , girlfriend ! "" 
to the president of the united states  
many witty gags take place , note the entire tent scene , and just plain , funny scenes which are so stupid- they're funny come a dozen per fifteen minutes  
take for example , scott evil going on the jerry springer show complaining about how evil his father is  
the way austin powers : tswsm uses its humor is clever , throwing a hilarious scene at you , followed by five minutes of one liners , followed by another outrageous scene , so you never stop laughing  
there was honestly not one moment in austin powers : tswsm where i wasn't laughing  
the last film that i laughed so hard in , was well , austin powers ! 
it is apparent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it  
the film even makes fun of itself in a line , something along the lines of , "" it's funny how england and southern california look nothing alike  "" 
tswsm was filmed in southern california , but was supposed to take place in england  
i can tell you one thing- he is having a lot of fun with this enormously popular character , which is all over television , newspapers , magazines , and the movie theaters  
i believe that dr  evil got more attention in the tswsm than austin powers did  
dr  evil provided more laughs , more memorable moments , and more interesting dialogue than austin did this time around , who seems to missing the funny touch that he had in the first film  
i felt that austin really did have his mojo taken away , but from screenplay writer mike myers , not fat bastard  
also making a great addition to the series is mini me , who is played by verne troyer  
even though the midget actor is 30 years old , he is adorable by dr  evil's side constantly  
the first austin powers film had barely any sentimental quality , such as lack of character development , barely any detailed plot characteristics , and barely any good acting , but austin powers tswsm actually shows some quality behind the frequent humor  
mike myers , with his three roles , acts as eddie murphy did in the nutty professor , disguising himself completely in one of the roles  
 ( fat bastard ) all three characters are different , and mike myers does do a good job handling each one of them  
heather graham made a great addition with her talent to tswsm , and does a much better job than elizabeth hurley did , who gave a very flat performance in the original , speaking her lines without any feeling or emotion  
speaking of hurley , she can be seen in tswsm for a few brief moments  
hopefully , graham tags along for future austin powers adventures "

1," ""   it's certainly more than just a monster story   "" 
- kenneth branagh , director/actor/co-writer of mary shelley's frankenstein  
kenneth branagh's new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein-films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world , including the most controversial version of them all - directed by james whale  
the dark and stormy nights , the lightning bolts , the charnel houses of spare body parts , the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful  
but the center of the film , quieter and more thoughtful , contains the real story  
horror-fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror  
branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues : morality , philosophy and human elements of the story , and not on old fashioned horror cliches  
his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel  
the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean  
the year is 1794  
a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters  
his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs  
as the ice closes around his ship , a figure appears on the horizon  
it's a man  
exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew  
his name is victor frankenstein ( kenneth branagh ) and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown  
the myserious stranger begins his tale , or more precisely his confession , in geneva , 1773  
he is remembering his childhood and youth  
laughter , banquets and parties - a happy life , without troubles or concerns  
here victor lived with his father ( ian holm ) , mother ( cherie lunghi ) , his surrogate sister ( helena boham carter ) and his servants in happiness and harmony  
this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed  
like thunder from a quite sky , his mother dies , giving birth to his youngest brother  
shocked , baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair , victor ( already interested in science ) becomes obsessed with death  
standing on his mother's grave he says : "" oh mother   you 
did not have to die    no one should ever die    i 
will stop this   i 
promiss   "" 
after proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished , victor travels to ingolstadt , in presuite of a medical career  
after a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night , creating life from death  
composing dead bodies , frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man - both physically and mentally  
with strong electrical impulses , he managed to breeth life into his creation  
the result was ugliness  
realizing what he has done , frankenstein tried to undo his work , but it was to late  
the creature has escaped  
because of the epidemic , frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home , making plans for the wedding  
for a while everything is as it was before his mother's death  
but then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously    
whale's picture , although powerful , never managed to capture the total depth of the novel "

1,"it is easy to see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his a  i  
artificial intelligence , just as it is understandable why spielberg was attracted to the material  
for here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home , an outcast seeking family , themes very familiar from most of spielberg's body of work from sugarland express to close encounters of the third kind to e  t  
to empire of the sun to hook to saving private ryan , naming just a few examples  
a  i  is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies  
it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances  
the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions , and with the number of births limited by the government , many couples are yearning for children  
and professor hobby ( william hurt ) has the solution  
a robotic boy named david ( haley joel osment ) , who is programmed to love  
as a test , david is placed with henry swinton ( sam robards ) and his wife , monica ( frances o'connor )  
their natural-born son has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be found for his illness  
the first third of a  i  
deals with david's life with the swintons and how that is changed by the recovery and return of their son , martin  
circumstances force david to be cut off from the swintons  
he is abandoned and alone  
david , highly influenced by the fairy tale , pinocchio , feels that if he becomes a real boy he can rekindle monica's love for him  
the film's second act follows david's search for the blue fairy , whom he believes will be able to fulfill his wish  
during these adventures he meets and is helped by gigolo joe ( jude law ) , a robot who specializes in sex  
spielberg is at his top form in this sequence , offering a brutal "" flesh fair "" where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying customers  
here , is where kubrick's influence is strongly felt , as the movie explores the fear and distrust humans have for robots  
the savagery conjures up images from the late director's a clockwork orange  
at about two hours and 30 minutes , the film begins to falter during the last 20 minutes , a sequence that seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed from close encounters  
it is all very anti-climatic and jarring  
these scenes seem almost superfluous , as if from a different film  
a  i  is a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg-13 rating  
it is a story combining hope and intolerance , sacrifice and bigotry , and while it does not coalesce perfectly , the movie does offer some disturbing images  
but a  i  
is really a showcase for the acting talents of the amazing young osment  
if ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination , it is this lad , who brings a sense of joy and wonder to the role of david , a being created for the express purpose of loving  
he shines when with monica , beaming with love , as eager as a puppy to please  
after being left in the woods , he is confused , lost , hurt , focusing on one objective : to become a real boy and find his way home so he can redeem himself in his mother's eyes  
law is pleasant as the care-free robot who really doesn't understand david's quest , but is nonetheless happy to help him on his journey  
probably the toughest role is o'connor's monica  
playing an emotional fragile woman who sees david as a substitute for her lost martin , she grows conflicted after her boy returns and she begins to perceive david not as a second chance , but as a threat to her family  
she gives her character enough emotional chaos that you cannot fault her for her course of action  
many of a  i  's futuristic sets are breathtaking , especially a mostly submerged new york , lost to the world by the melting of the polar ice caps  
a  i  is a flawed film , and you cannot get through the entire feature without pondering - even subconsciously - how it would have turned out with kubrick instead of spielberg behind the camera  
would it have been darker ? 
more cynical ? 
we will never know  
we can only judge what is before us on the screen , a collaboration of two cinematic giants "

1,"this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city , of james cameron's most heralded film , titanic  
postponed from last summer , with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history , this was one film i was eager to preview  
so , is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday ? 
my best guess     it will sink , though with many awards attatched to its hull  
no doubt , titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made  
it boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date  
to see a ship fall apart , with actual people running across the ship , flying across the deck , and falling to the water , is just amazing to look at  
the effects are so stunningly realistic , you would swear you were looking at actual footage  
but titanic is more than a disaster movie , and that's where the problem lies  
there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise  
i'll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you : 
the film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic  
we see actual footage of the sunken ship , as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor  
bill paxton leads the expedition , in search of sunken treasure  
what he finds instead , leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage  
we meet rose ( kate winslet ) , a young woman , who comes from an upper-class family  
rose is to be wed to a man she does not love  
we meet jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a young man , who comes from a poor financial background , and wins a ticket aboard the titanic , in a poker game  
the two meet under interesting circumstances , and the love story begins  
add in a jealous fiance , and a not-so-nice law officer played by david warner , and you have a story that , well , gets a bit overplayed and oversappy  
i must add , at this point , that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates , as a woman with "" new money "" who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship  
she is a pleasure to see on screen  
when the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1 : 40 into the film , and eventually sinks , you never really feel for any of these characters  
the film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on  
the effects are tremendous  
from the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room , to a doomed ship cracking at the seams , this is an effects picture that looks and sounds like no other  
we saw titanic in dolby digital surround , and by far , it is the best sounding movie i have ever seen  
my friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard  
when people are in the water , at film's end , you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles  
titanic runs far too long  
the movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length  
and , while most of the first 2  5 hours runs very fast and well-paced , the final 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop , and you realize that this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends  
don't get me wrong about titanic     it's 
not a bad as i am making it out to be  
it really is an exceptionaly well-made film  
the costumes and sets are incredible , and true to the time period  
the ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form , as we see actual pictures of the modern-day wreckage , transformed into the movie depiction  
this film will certainly win on effects , costume , set design and sound  
cameron has certainly made his best film to date  
unfortunately , titanic is not a best picture candidate  
it just doesn't have a strong supporting story  
it's an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside  
it just doesn't have the emotional impact that i suspect mr  cameron was shooting for  
i predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews "

1,"contact is a nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagan's only novel  
it details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of a young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway ( jodie foster )  
we first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico , where she is part of the seti ( search for extraterrestrial intelligence ) project  
her research is quickly killed , however , by her highly political david drumlin ( tom skerrit ) , who disdains "" pure research "" in favor of science with "" commercial applications  
she goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s  r  
hadden ( john hurt )  
then , with that money just about to finally dry up , ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal  
in the movie's most exciting and believable sequence , ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega  
at first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers , then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before  
further decoding , with hadden's help , reveals another layer to message , containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine  
it appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens' home world  
of course , the big question becomes "" who gets to ride it ? "" 
 ( right after "" who's gonna pay for this thing ? "" )  
to boil it down , ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism , while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith  
drumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform ( apparently to keep "" godless science "" from talking to god , or something like that )  
then hadden reappears with startling news  
he has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie , in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest  
ellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream-like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels , where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father ( david morse )  
when she returns home , no one believes her  
she was not even gone for one second , they say , even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours  
her story is officially discredited , although believed by a large segment of the public ( who don't even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static  
  
  
eighteen hours worth of static )  
there is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first  
ellie arroway is a well-rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working  
neither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs , but that's a tough standard to meet  
ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures  
her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally  
drumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble  
hadden obviously has affection for ellie , but in the end he seems to see her as his creation , nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board  
even palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , ellie's love interest , takes a paternalistic interest in ellie , seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses  
the film is technically impressive , especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine  
the part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain  
the film falls apart when dealing with its central theme , the dichotomy between science and religion  
this is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved  
the film presents science pretty well ( until the end ) so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith  
religious people are presented as shallow caricatures  
rob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank ( very subtle , guys ) , the voice of the religious right  
another religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine ( jake busey )  
the only really fleshed-out religious person , palmer joss , is supposed to be a minister of some sort , but his actual faith is left pretty vague  
i can't even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian  
all we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about pre-marital sex  
the film drops the science ball at the very end , when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith  
in a day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist "" religious "" doctrine , this is exactly the wrong message to send  
in a movie dealing with issues of science and faith , the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism  
what ellie should have said was , "" you shouldn't believe me  
not without evidence , and i don't have the evidence  
i know what happened but you shouldn't take my word alone  "" 
that is the voice of science speaking  
the character of david drumlin is another problem with this film "
1,"martin scorsese's films used to intimidate me  
because of his reputation , i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks  
as much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something  
i learned from scorsese's casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story  
no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies  
for example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other  
there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on  
or toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building  
again , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing  
i don't mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking  
but he simply uses the best tool for the job  
it shouldn't have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward  
the movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet  
the movie's title is another name for the dalai lama which means "" ocean of wisdom  "" 
his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story  
 ( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film's opening shot and watch where it is repeated  ) 
we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old  
his curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama  
a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before  
several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items  
the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own  
the boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama  
scorsese and long-time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk  
before selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation  
sometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice  
either way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader  
>from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama's spirit and the future leader of a nation  
it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child  
in the u  s  it might be grounds for a call to social services  
but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage  
neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable , well-rounded person  
certain patterns take shape over the years  
for example , the dalai lama is fascinated by technology  
radios , clocks , and telescopes are some of his favorite toys  
when he is old enough to accept his leadership , he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet  
he also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain , including herd animals  
it's nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter  
but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet's gigantic neighbor , china  
tibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china , as , first the propaganda , then the political pressure , and finally the armies , come across their common border  
the chinese invasion is so successful that the lama's life is in danger if he stays  
the movie ends when , after much agonizing , the dalai lama leaves tibet for india  
the story doesn't lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do  
it just doesn't fit that mold  
if it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie ( perhaps more like seven years in tibet , which is good in its own right )  
the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that  
the structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events , not vice-versa  
perhaps because the pace is slower , we have more time to notice the beautiful art , vestments , and architecture of tibet  
a mandala , ( tibetan sand painting ) with beautiful , vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie  
the robes and hats of state are bright red and gold "

1,"i like movies with albert brooks , and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks  
lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies  
his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today , inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator  
you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film , while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent "" talk films "" which are finding their way into theaters  
the situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with , but even if we can't , brooks has the talent to make them comfortable , and therefore we laugh  
teenagers and jim carrey fans probably won't find an albert brooks movie very funny , but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will  
put simply , brooks' comedy is intelligent  
mother is albert brooks' latest film , and it does not disappoint  
brooks plays john henderson , a middle-aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce  
he makes an attempt at dating , but fails miserably  
he then has dinner with his brother jeff ( rob morrow ) , a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life  
jeff has a good job , a loving family , and most of all , a warm relationship with their mother beatrice ( debbie reynolds )  
after dinner , john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice , and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky-dory the dialog is  
in comparison , beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him , and john gives it right back to her  
at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john's life , she says , "" i love you , "" and john replies with , "" i know you think you do  "" 
the thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading  
it's the kind that goes something like , "" yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but     "" 
it seems as though nothing he does makes her happy  
there's always the big but  
john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self-esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner  
he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is  
 "" a great experiment "" , he calls it  
brooks' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother  
there's a scene where john has just arrived at his mother's house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the "" great experiment "" , beatrice asks , "" now explain to me again why you don't want to stay at a hotel  "" 
she still doesn't get it , and it is absolutely hilarious  
in the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh  
she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over  
when john points out the ice on the sherbet , beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze  
 "" you've named the ice ? "" 
asks john  
he's also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator , such as a twenty-pound block of cheese  
 "" the freezer was a good invention , "" says john , "" but it's not supposed to be used for everything  
that's why it's smaller than the refrigerator  "" 
it's something most of us find strangely familiar  
brooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur  
for example , in defending your life , his and meryl streep's characters are in a comedy club having a discussion  
when they're finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line , "" and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outside ! "" 
you don't know what the joke was because you couldn't hear him during the entire scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context  
in this film , brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene  
i don't want to give them away , but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past  
john's purpose for staying with his mother is to learn , and we as the audience learn right along with him  
his mother is not the fascinating type to begin with , but as john spends more time with her , we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth  
watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way  
on screen , brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character : you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world  
in a way , he's very much like yosarian of catch-22 , expect with something of an attitude  
casting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect  
she assumes the part with ease , even moving and speaking a little slowly , and is just so adorable it's hard to get mad at her character  
this only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her  
as his first choice , brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice , but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband , who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer's disease  
that may be just as well , since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely "

you've seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler's list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker  
if you've read any reviews , you've also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy  
you also may have heard that this one's too kiddie-friendly , and doesn't have enough content for adults  
believe the hype  
the effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala's sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth  
but there's something missing here , and it isn't budget or effects - it's everything money * can't * buy  
the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters  
the most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence  
he is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out  
portman's queen amidala and mcgregor's obi-wan kenobi don't fare nearly so well  
amidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life )  
and obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he's nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn's batman  
however , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job  
he also absolutely nails alec guiness' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise  
in fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that's one of the problems with this film  
i would never call myself a "" star wars "" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america  
however , if you are the one person in america who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost  
for example , one of the film's main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine  
for those of you not recently steeped in "" star wars "" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader's master in "" return of the jedi "" and "" empire strikes back  "" 
so , obviously , his appearance in "" phantom menace "" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful  
a lot of the movie is like that  
r2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it's obvious that lucas is banking on the audience's pre-existing fondness for them    
because he doesn't do much to add to it in any way  
same goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn't look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy  
even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from "" empire strikes back "" ) , and alderaan ( leia's home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in "" star wars "" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing  
what's the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? 
the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty  
there's no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be  
another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film  
i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters  
and jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast  
unlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you'll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive "" teenage mutant ninja turtles  "" 
furthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot  
oddly , this isn't just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids  
well , he's done a good job  
the hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy  
that's not jake lloyd's fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him  
that's another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader  
warning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! 
in my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin's future evil in the film  
the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there's nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie  
he has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine  
but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn't all hearts and roses is yoda's hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn  
his explanation ? 
 "" his future is clouded  "" 
 ( warning : major spoiler ahead  
enter at your own risk  ) 
of course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side  
this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup  
because qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon's young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself  
so , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin "" darth vader "" skywalker "

1,"it has happened again  
a movie that is well scripted , well acted , and well directed  
it is involving , suspenseful    
it even has an unexpected twist at the end that packs a punch like a blow to the solar plexus  
but in order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie  
the sixth sense is that movie  
starring bruce willis ( armageddon ) as a child psychologist and haley joel osment ( forrest gump ) as a troubled youngster , the sixth sense is more spooky than scary , though it does contain disturbing images designed to startle  
eight-year-old cole sear ( osment ) sees dead people  
not just in dreams  
and not just as lifeless bodies  
he sees them walking around like regular people  
and he sees them all the time  
dr  malcolm crowe ( willis ) is trying to help him  
he recognizes in cole many of the same attributes as one of his earlier patients whom crowe failed , resulting in that patient shooting crowe before turning the gun on himself  
if crowe could manage to find a way to help cole , he believes he just might be able to put his own demons to rest  
but first he needs to gain cole's trust  
the boy is so frightened by what he sees , he has closed himself off emotionally , being unwilling to tell anyone    
not crowe , not even his own mother ( toni collette , clockwatchers )    
about his "" secrets  "" 
crowe begins to spend more and more time with him , even as his own marriage starts to dissolve around him , his wife anna ( olivia williams , rushmore ) becoming cold and distant because of his neglect of her and his preoccupation with the boy  
bruce willis underplays his role , allowing the excellent script to do most of the work of building character development  
crowe moves from treating a troubled boy who won't communicate , to treating a troubled boy who is having hallucinations , to wondering if perhaps there isn't some truth behind what the boy sees  
mr  willis does a serviceable job , letting the focus remain on the story instead of on his familiar action hero screen persona  
eleven-year-old haley joel osment manages to impress us with his performance  
he demonstrates an amazing amount of self-composure as well as an ability to play nuances in a complex character as if he were a seasoned pro  
it is fine work for one of such a tender age  
keep your eye on this young man  
the supporting cast is also quite effective  
toni collette , as the confused , frightened , and frustrated mother who can't understand what is happening to her child ; olivia williams , as crowe's once loving wife who is shutting down emotionally due to the lack of attention from her husband ; and donnie wahlberg ( ransom ) as crowe's ex-patient , now grown , who illustrates his doctor's failure to help him in the most vivid terms imaginable  
twenty-eight year old m  night shyamalan ( wide awake ) directed his own script , maintaining a proper tension throughout the film and crafting the storytelling so expertly that the film's full impact is not reached until its final moments , when a surprising revelation forces a reevaluation of all that preceded it  
it is a rare movie which manages to pull that off and mr  shyamalan , as the one responsible , is certainly to be commended  
in giving the sixth sense a favorable "" three star "" review for its craftsmanship and artistic merit , i must also point out that , spiritually speaking , the film is highly misleading  
there is no scriptural foundation upon which to base a belief in ghosts or the "" living dead  "" 
the concept of death being a doorway to another plane of existence is a devilish lie that has been around as long as man himself  
the first lie recorded in the bible was devised by the serpent who assured eve , "" thou shall not surely die , "" a direct contradiction of god's admonition  
that same lie has been perpetuated ad infinitum throughout the ages  
scriptures do speak of a time when the dead shall rise but that wonderful demonstration of victory over death will not commence until after the second coming of christ    
an event which has not yet occurred  
therefore , the dead remain in a state of oblivion , having no consciousness , until that long-awaited time when the final trump shall sound "
1,"with the success of the surprise hit alien , directed by ridley scott , a sequel was inevitable  
in fact , after watching the first film , a sequel was wanted , particularly by this reviewer  
handing over the director's chair to recent box office gem james cameron , who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii , a surprisingly dull film , and terminator , making cameron a household name ) , the alien series got a face-lift of immense proportions  
instead of being a suspense/science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture  
what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created  
a film like aliens comes along only once in a while , and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it  
i never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have  
the terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear  
aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen  
with a science fiction plot , cameron gives aliens added testosterone , pumping up the action and fire power from the original film  
in fact , aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original  
perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero--or heroine , as the case may be  
never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film , and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character  
sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about  
placing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual , but because of weaver's presence , a woman is the only suitable hero  
aliens begins 57 years after alien ended  
lieutenant ellen ripley ( weaver ) is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened  
she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens , but "" the company "" is doubtful  
they explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left  
despite stern warnings from ripley , the company remains rigid and won't call the families back  
however , when the company loses contact with the colony , ripley's story seems much more feasible  
one of the company's directors , carter burke ( paul reiser ) , wants to gather a team to travel to the planet  
this team includes a buff private vasquez ( jenette goldstein ) , a questionable corporal hicks ( michael biehn ) , and a loyal android bishop ( lance henriksen )  
burke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony  
arriving on the planet , the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon-type environment  
the only survivor is 12 year old rebecca "" newt "" jorden ( carrie henn )  
ripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become , and she becomes newt's surrogate mother  
ripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened , and soon , all hell breaks loose  
aliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott's version , it also multiplies the number of aliens in general  
alien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member , except ripley , who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo  
aliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens , and as a result , the chills are incredibly heightened  
then again , this is james cameron , the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2 : judgment day  
he is the best action director out there ( topping renny harlin , who directed cliffhanger ) , and only he could create something as terrifying as this film  
it seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes , and aliens has the motherload  
with perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film , aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion  
i can't recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout , never dropping for a moment  
just when you think the movie is over , something else will occur , and it starts right back up again  
with a seemingly endless conclusion , aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history  
this scene is usually the one remembered most from the film , as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen  
using flawless special effects , the climax is exhausting , leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety  
of course , for a film of this genre to work properly , the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see  
aliens is completely realistic , even a decade after its initial release  
the special effects are wonderfully seamless , with a terrifying alien to go with them  
one of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music , composed by cameron-regular james horner  
horner has created a terrific score , receiving an oscar nomination for his work  
not only that , horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film , or science fiction film ever ( and that includes 2001 : a space odyssey , which was mainly a compilation of well-known composers )  
in fact , the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music  
the production design is incredible , which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy  
dark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive , but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well-lit locations  
normally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer ; aliens uses lights to scare the viewer  
then , of course , is the cinematography , which uses point of view shots , along with video feeds in order to build suspense "

1,"as i write the review for the new hanks/ryan romantic comedy you've got mail , i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet  
i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world's biggest paid commercial for america online  
and i wonder : is that so bad ? 
well , the commercial part is  
as for the movie , well , as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan , i think i'll be okay  
to paraphrase james berardinelli , whose reviews i admire very much , tom hanks and meg ryan can act  
they are both wonderful , but for all of hanks' glorious work in serious films , such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan , and his glorious triumph in philadelphia , i like him best when he's suitably obnoxious  
tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he's going to get the girl : the only question is how ? 
meg ryan , america's high school sweetheart , can act  
she's had a handful of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don't , get the movie-- fantastic )  
but , i like her best when she's , well , perky  
she is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks , they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime  
some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don't really know  
all i know is that i just like them both  
they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that's really hard to resist , and i'm not going to even try  
they're just really , really cute , sweet , and charming  
hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron , who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle  
here , the setup is a little different  
kathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children's bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her  
she is successful , beautiful , and dates a well-known columnist with very radical idea ( kinnear )  
she is also having an affair , of sorts  
you see , kathleen , with the handle shopgirl , is secretly emailing ny152  
they have a strictly un-detailed relationship : there are no specifics , and they have no idea who each other is  
ny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) , a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega-bookstores , run by his father ( coleman )  
fox books has decided to open a store on the west side , right across from a little children's bookseller named "" shop around the corner "" , run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly  
every morning , these two email each other silly , and every day , they fight "" to the death ! ! ""  
it's a charming premise , and one that works nicely , balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have  
it also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no "" let's have sex tonight "" mantra , if you'll excuse my bluntness  
this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love  
hmm  well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan "" hook up "" , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness  
you know it's going to happen , the question is now ? 
thankfully , ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two sweet kids  
it's all cute and wonderful , and for all of the idealism , it makes me feel good  
hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is  
he is , i believe , america's greatest actor  
does he show it here ? 
nah  
but he's still tom hanks , and she's still meg ryan  
which is what this movie boils down to  
it's pure confection  
all the bits about the godfather , the jokes , the superb script , it's all really sweet  
there are some immense flaws , like pacing  
the last third of the movie really doesn't work as well as i would have liked , and for a romantic comedy , it's slow  
once hanks knows the secret , it gets really slow  
i even looked at my watch a couple times , to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for , so that i could get home at a reasonable hour  
the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated  
e-mail ? 
when my kids are my age , i don't know what we'll be using  
but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody , and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history  
they just work together , and it's nice to see  
it gives you , well , a smile  
the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious , and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake  
i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was  
i've always believed that movies are very powerful , very powerful indeed  
you see , mankind has three abilities he needs to survive : the ability to think , entertain , and procreate "

1,"seen at the 21st portland international film festival 
film title : supermarket woman director : juzo itami country : japan 1997 cinematography : yonezo maeda music : toshiyuki honda cast : nobuko miyamoto , masahitko tsugawa , shiro ito , yuji miyake , akiko matsumoto super features : typical itami film    
funny and pointed in its own way  
if you don't care how and what the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket , then this film is not for you     
maybe it is better to ignore it , as this strong and biting satire , as only juzo itami can deliver , will give you an insight as to what some foods go through  
having , in the past , made films that pulled every punch imaginable , from the family traditions ( the funeral ) , to taxes ( a taxing woman & a taxing woman returns ) , to the diabolical gangsters ( minbo ) , to hospitals ( the seriously ill ) , juzo itami , this time takes on the supermarkets' own war , to get the consumers  
and while this film has its funny side , in the crazy situations that it creates , it also shows another side , which is very much the attitude of a corporate structure that is more concerned with its profits than it is with any customer  
goro has a supermarket  
and a competitor comes into the neighborhood , trying to take him out of business by providing less expensive prices for everything that is sold in the supermarket  
bargains galore , its name , has in mind the closure of goro's humbler venue , so that in the end it can mark up its prices in any way it can  
goro hires hanako , a housewife whose talents seem to be better suited to management , than they are in anything else  
hanako , as she gets familiar with the operation , discovers many of the tricks of the trade , done by many of the elders in charge of each section of the market  
and the procedures , are not always "" fresh "" food , but a new packaging and a new date , to try and convince the customers that quality is on the shelves  
hanako's ideas take hold , starting with a few of the women that work in the supermarket , being that they do not even shop there at all  
and hanako discovers along the way that a few giveaways here and there make a bit of a difference  
if not cause some serious problems in the running of the store  
a price error , forces them to give away eggs for very low prices , and causes the store a few hassles , but , it brought the people in , and everyone knows that these customers will buy a few other things  
as the operation gets stronger , the competition also has trickery up its sleeve , and it has been undermining much of the operation by paybacks to one of the store managers , as well as the meat and fish elder supervisors  
eventually these people are found out , and hanako has to tread slowly and carefully , until in the end they all have a showdown  
and here , the truth and honesty win out , and even one of the elders decides to stay rather than go to work for the corrupt opponent  
in the process , they also find that "" freshness "" ( with some very funny jokes on this word as well ) becomes a much more important tool than they imagined  
with some very nice performances , in this hectic , and fast paced film , this film gives us a sitting of two hours that is satisfying in many ways , although a failed love story between goro and hanako does not come off much , even though towards the end it is suggested  
but this would take away from the satire and its strengths  
with food gags all over the place , the film lets you have it  
and what fun it is  
worth seeing  
 ( editorial ) the director of this film , juzo itami , died shortly after the film was finished , and he left behind a legacy of comedy and satire that is rare , and uncompromising  
we would wish that he had been able to make one about film making , of which he must have had a few stories to tell , but we will have to do with much of the japanese society , and its many errant ways     
not to say that these things do not happen anywhere else     
america is no less guilty of any of these subjects at all , should anyone have the guts to tackle it    
we could learn something along the way , too     
worth seeing , specially , is a taxing woman and its follow up a taxing woman returns  
the funeral is also good , although not as funny as the later films  
tampopo is also very enjoyable  
all four of these films are available in video , which means your best local site for foreign film may have them  "

1,"i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files  
first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie  
the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable  
you have to reach for a larger audience  
therefore , the movie is quite user-friendly  
altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange  
but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on  
you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera  
in any case , the answer is no  
i am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium  
however , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie  
i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new  
everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others  
i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie  
warning : major spoilers follow ! 
please do not read to fully enjoy this movie , you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird "" hummm "" sound is all about  
you have been warned  
the x-files is what a summer should be  
exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances  
this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank  
from start to finish , this movie does not let go of you  
when i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon  
this flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes  
in fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue  
you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! 
the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid  
you know , when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? 
so yeah , the x-files is scary  
and guess what ? 
you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster  
do not think that the x-files is a monster movie  
in fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total  
no , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series  
scully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time  
she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much  
no , this is mulder's time in the spotlight  
by now , you have heard of the scene where mulder "" showers "" independence day  
if you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let's just say that due to recent events mulder should be "" showering "" godzilla instead  
to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there    who 
cares ! ? 
if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? 
the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous  
the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill  
the script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose  
if you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! 
unlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects  
miss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense  
also , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies    don't ! 
the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation  
there is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? 
 ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose  
who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a "" big emotional scene "" between godzilla attacks ? 
so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i'd recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose  
but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is  
what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ? 
cool effects ? 
it's got some  
pulse pounding ? 
hell yes ! 
strangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time "

1,"in 1987 the stock market crashed , and oliver stone's wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses  
wall street lucked out in its timing ; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had , and though its kill-or-be-killed approach to business was exaggerated , that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan-era businessman  
stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs  evil tale relayed in the fast-paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange  
critics and audiences lauded wall street , elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic  
i'm proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them  
i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone's output with its thin caricatures , obvious sentiments , and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen  
stone goes for broke in every scene ( the same could be said for nearly all of his works )  
this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions  
he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane  
it's all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity , rather than explore what these situations are really like  
i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative ( as they are presented in boiler room ) rather than laughably over the top  
these guys are salesmen after all , not televised judges  
more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street  
the only possible solution i can muster is its release date  
and not just the timeliness of the "" greed is good "" subject matter : the film was plumped down in the eighties , a decade in which the one-joke comedy rose to an art form , and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept , low result movies  
in my mind , the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies , but bad music , bad hair , and bad clothes  
maybe stone's after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace  
boiler room is an equally well-timed film with some similarities to stone's piece of crap  
they both feature a consequential father-son relationship , though boiler room's is much more subtle and touching  
and they are both concerned with the power of greed , yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery-smooth , heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street  
boiler room is a message movie as well , though ( at least until the end ) doesn't shove it in our faces  
boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash  
as i said , this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day ( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn't been seen in quite a while ) ; not only do we want to be millionaires , we want to watch other people become millionaires ! 
in our super-judgmental , power-oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything ; when you have money , you have it "" all ""  
and seth ( giovanni ribisi ) wants it "" all "" the easy way  
he's a well-intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm ( the kind that sells junk stock ) whereupon he meets others just like him  
ben affleck is cast as jim , the company headhunter , who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko  
his job is to influence trainee's into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood  
it's ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b  s that they're told to dish out to prospective buyers  
affleck's character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin's similar character in glengary glen ross , and that proves detrimental to the actor's performance  
affleck shouts , curses and be-littles his rookie employees just like baldwin , minus the edge  
when alec played the scene he became the part , spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own  
by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading  
the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks : they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game  
rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are : intellectual gangsters  
they aren't above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes  
we drink up this world along with seth , and watch him become seduced by it , just like we might be  
as in all cautionary tales , boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing , then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness  
i know this story  
we all do  
but it can work if it's told with intelligence and energy , and that is how writer \ director ben younger tells it  
as a director of ( please excuse my french ) mise-en-scene younger has much to learn  
his style is sitcom bland  
but his writing isn't  
younger's script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch ; his dialogue is like a junior david mamet  
despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone-pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script  
the brokers \ hucksters counter every customer objection , gently bullying them into buying stock  
these moments are filmed like psychological action scenes : a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn't aware that he is one  
with the exception of affleck's brief appearances , the performances are truly exceptional  
ribisi , who has the edgy looks of a character actor , is extremely potent here , working his pale angular face , and eerie , plaintive stare for all their worth "

1,"i know that "" funnest "" isn't a word  
 "" fun "" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective  
but that's the word that came to me right after viewing "" chicken run  "" 
no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like "" that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! "" 
so to hell with webster's -- "" chicken run "" is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while  
i can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner  
the chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something  
living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box  
one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer  
rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs  tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan  
she orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , "" chickens go in ; pies come out  "" 
what sort of pies ? 
chicken pies , of course  
co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : "" creature comforts , "" "" the wrong trousers , "" and "" a close shave  "" 
the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures  
part of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new  
 "" the wrong trousers , "" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and "" a close shave "" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories  
but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived  
now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in "" chicken run  "" 
the plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement  
thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done  
part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? 
park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is  
but they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us  
another thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing  
there are references to "" the great escape , "" obviously , and "" stalag 17  "" 
the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both "" raiders of the lost ark "" and "" indiana jones and the temple of doom  "" 
there's even a nod to "" the blues brothers , "" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history  
the "" braveheart "" reference is a hoot if you catch it  
when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , "" chicken run "" is downright brilliant in its execution  
consider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of "" blair witch project "" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online  
out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome  
why ? 
because once you got past the thought that "" they're parodying that 'blair witch' movie , "" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose  
they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing  
conversely , "" chicken run "" doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene  
if you've never seen "" indiana jones , "" the chase sequence is still fun  
even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character  
park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , "" chicken run "" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either  
enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , "" chicken run "" is that much richer  
the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them  
ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on "" absolutely fabulous "" ) nails it  
she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer  
the characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived , but sweet  
poor mr  tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help  
jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence  
they even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs  egg dilemma  
one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of "" chicken run , "" it comes as a delightful surprise  
the film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens  
the animation is first-rate  
remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable "" chicken run "" really is  
this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail "

1,"a couple of months ago , when i first downloaded the face/off trailer from the net , my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold 'yawn'  
followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key , not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss-poor trailer  
then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u  s      unique    excellent     must-see  
well , i thought still skeptical , i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here  
'here' , of course , was still three months away  
i'll admit , when i trotted off to see this film , the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow  
i'd heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled , but his films were definitely not on my must-see list  
that , let me tell you , has changed completely  
i knew this fact only five minutes into the film , after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet  
the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick  
seriously  
i've never been a big john travolta fan , but he , like cage , perfectly suited his role in the movie      sorry , 
make that 'roles' in the movie  
even travolta's great performance , however , paled in comparison to cage's character portrayals  
my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler's hideout  
half drugged out of his mind , he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his son's death from castor's perspective - "" doesn't it just break your heart  "" he mutters coldly  
now don't go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie - it's not  
that's what really makes this movie unique  
it's an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters      not a common mix at all  
suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though      that's 
the only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other    "

1,"i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live-action-disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins , separated at birth by divorcing parents , never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again  
and everyone should know how i feel about remakes , especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you're going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea )  
this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list , and was actually quite the opposite  
contemporary live-action-disney films are not one of my favorties , anyway : they're usually unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10  
this one , however , is shockingly not bad  
in fact , it's actually good  
not the original good , but what's great about it is that it doesn't necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining  
because it's cute and innocent fun  
because it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with  
because the lead star is immensely appealing  
because the parents are also immensely appealing  
and ( i'm repeating myself ) because it's cute and innocent fun  
there's nothing too risque about it , save the plot ( the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish , but that is precisely the point of the movie ) , and it's aimed directly at either kids , adults who want to remember the original , or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid  
i , personally , am somewhere between the second and third  
i can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn't so weird or diverse ( the names godard and kubrick weren't even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc's "" wonderful world of disney , "" where they'd show you a live-action and/or made-for-tv disney flick an hour per week  
i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films ( like "" lady and the tramp "" and "" pinnochio "" )  
and , most sadly , i remember every single christmas , without fail , there were a barage of children's animated half-hour shows , made exclusively for the christmas season , that i wouldn't dare missing  
i can even remember seeing the made-for-tv "" parent trap ii "" on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the original "" parent trap  "" 
it's more of a late childhood movie , because it deals with the issue of divorce , but it deals with it in a disney-ized version  
it's playful , and witty , and charming , and if i saw it for the first time right now , having never experienced that part of my childhood , i'd probably dismiss it  
i'd probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn't seen the original at such a perfect age  
watching it , i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film , and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly-perfect parents splitting up , and how it affected my adolescence  
and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke , and pointed out that even in the most fucked-up of situations , things could always work out if you , well , manipulate things a bit , at least for the better  
this new version did that for me , but it's also charming in its own way  
it has a new cast , a contemporary feel , and , for the first time in awhile for a live-action-disney flick , a tone that isn't corny or condescending , but just right  
the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way  
and for the first time since the original film , the kids actually know better than the foolish adults  
the story is basically classic by now , repeated almost as many times as kurosawa's "" the seven samurai "" : a pair of twins ( played here by lindsay lohan , just like they were played by hayley mills in the original ) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents  
one , annie , is sent to live with the mother ( natasha richardson , resembling her mother , vanessa redgrave , more than i had ever noticed ) in london , where she lives with her parents and her devoted , foppish butler ( simon kunz ) , as she works as a swingin' fashion designer  
she grows up refined and classy , but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker-playing  
the other , hallie , is sent to northern california with her father ( dennis quaid ) to live on a vineyard with their pseudo-maid ( lisa ann walter ) , and grows up rugged yet charming  
they both meet at the same camp , one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged  
they feud because they look all-too similar , and are thus in tight competition , which results in some nasty pranks , which winds them in seclusion together in a private , out-of-the-way cabin  
there , they become friends , then learn about eachother  
once they know everything , they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent , whom they've only heard of  
they learn about eachother's lives in detail , they make sure they look alike ( which requires hair cutting and , notoriously , ear-piercing - a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in "" pulp fiction "" ) , and when the end of summer comes , they switch and hope for the best  
lindsay lohan doesn't necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original  
but she comes off just as appealing as she did once  
she does , though , add a couple new things : she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original , respectively  
she also adds on an american and british accent to each one , with one faking the other accent throughout , and if you really take notice , you can see that the fake ones' accents aren't exactly perfect  
she's also incredibly appealing , not merely cute , which is especially notable since this is her first feature film , and we know how notorious child actors are , especially in their first films  
she makes a great protagonist , and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing  
dennis quaid , in fact , hasn't been this likable in about a decade - his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past , not just that he's mr  meg ryan  
ditto natasha richardson ( except that she just hasn't ever been this likable period )  
the two make a winning couple , maybe not so winning as maureen o'hara and the late brian keith in the original , but they still work for this film  
instead of the bickering that ensued in the original , the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original : during the opening credits , we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2 , where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother , and when back together again , the film's more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental , but in that great way , not the migraine-inducing way as in many such films  
this all brings this new "" parent trap "" to a level of entertainment that hasn't really existed since , well , the original film years ago , still my money the best live-action-disney flick of all time  
this is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot ( a gold-digging sharon stone type , played by elaine hendrix , who's deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film ) a treat instead of a bore  
like the original , this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be ( case in point : "" it takes two "" starring the olsen twins ) because it treats the children as the smart ones , and the adults as the silly ones , not the other way around  
and because , above everything , it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew "

1,"people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies  
often science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller  
in such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked  
but , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic  
such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman  
the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits  
but the right stuff film isn't even fiction  
it was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program  
the plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes  
the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier  
many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado  
but one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records  
ten years later , soviets have launched "" sputnik "" marking the beginning of the space age  
in order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space  
best air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image  
in one of critics' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s  
such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman's film looks quite atypical for its time  
with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life  
but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker  
philip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies  
the right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking "" artsy "" projects  
the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film  
the plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts  
the film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece  
that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles  
sam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty  
on the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases  
shepard's performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn  
young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward  
always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard  
kaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots' wives  
royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b  johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch  
great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman's superb direction  
most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time  
the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline  
everything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world  
in that setting , it's quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights  
but the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and "" natural "" pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots  
their entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity  
this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , "" mercury "" astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space  
those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman's superb use of poetic movie language  
editing is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films )  
although kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights  
those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space  
another fine contribution of this film is "" oscar "" -awarded musical score by bill conti ; i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it  
it is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy  
some of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period  
this film is great , and its cult status is well deserved , but there are some minor flaws  
some of the "" mercury "" astronauts aren't fleshed out enough ( although being played by fine actors , like lance henriksen )  
film also lacks proper closure "

because thats all that there really is     
i found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot  
for one thing , a white leading actor who has a black daughter does leave some curiosity     
i am not saying that this isn't possible   
but it does leave one to wonder    i 
know i did  
another thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out     
and certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations  
there was one scene that should have been short    
but it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking   
ok enough already get on with it  
there are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do    
things just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort    
another thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning  
this movie is also very predictable    
you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment   
granted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you  
also some of the things that happen are a little too predictable and several cliques are repeated    
it gets boring at times to tell you the truth    
even though there is still action going on  
another little point i might add is that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero  
some of the characters are not proper for their roles  
the acting is fine but the characters just don't seem to add up  
if i was to base my review totally on the plot then i wouldn't rate this movie too highly but that's just the thing this movie isn't just the plot , its the whole package and this package is really well done "

soldier a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman 
the warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body  
jungian archetypes , these two opposites need each other to create a whole , but it's difficult to integrate both  
often we'll encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and , with the help of jung's magician , sit around imagining grand schemes  
without the drive to manifest their plans , much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness , all they have are dreams  
warriors on the other hand , are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat , and will do combat with every last bit of their energy  
they don't care enough about anything to know what's worth fighting for : gladiators who live only for the battle  
this dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know , but can also illustrate societies  
america during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers  
todd 3465 ( kurt russell ) is a living , breathing archetype  
chosen from birth as a soldier , he is raised by the government to be a killing machine  
his childhood is cruelty and competition  
he is indoctrinated with the big rules  
never question authority  
winning is everything  
strength beats knowledge  
a veteran of numerous intergalactic wars , todd is 40 and he's obsolete  
a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger  
left for dead after a test battle with the best of the new killers , caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) , he's unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234 , a garbage world  
obviously our hero is still alive  
he finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health  
when the peace-loving colonists get a good look at who todd is , they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world  
they are the other good guys  
these lovers find that they need a warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons  
todd finds himself in the role of protector  
what could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultra-right wing future is ruined by turning the film into a cartoon  
the effects are mostly second-rate explosions or jerky slow motion  
the plot is old hat  
we don't get even a glimpse at the society that created the soldiers  
hardly anything makes sense  
the film's science fares badly  
with all the remarkable advances we've made in just 37 years ( the film takes place in 2036 ) , we're still stupid  
after conquering the stars , for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it to a landfill light years away  
even stranger , the garbage barges appear to double as time machines  
virtually all the trash is vintage 1960  
there is nothing in the story that is not predictable  
the first thing that todd sees after coming back to life is sandra ( connie nielsen ) , the woman just a little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care of him  
it doesn't take a genius to foresee that her husband isn't going to be around much longer  
is it a shock to find out that the film's climax is an unarmed battle between todd and caine ? 
who would you guess wins ? 
some of the scenes would work if this were a comedy  
todd's first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connie's nipple poking through her thin blouse  
later as he sits by his lonely campfire , a tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion  
supposedly this clich ? isn't meant to be humorous  
dastardly col  mekum ( jason isaacs ) with a pencil-thin mustache is as real as snidley whiplash  
responsible for last year's quirky and visually enticing but problematic "" the fifth element "" , director paul anderson sees the film as "" shane "" in outer space  
maybe , if shane were played by sylvester stallone in rambo mode  
the movie doesn't even work as an action film  
there is never a question as to the outcome  
somehow the new superior soldiers don't prove much of a match for todd  
the acting isn't anything to write home about  
nielsen almost comes across as a real person but is soon relegated to a background victim  
russell is buffed-up and does a credible job but it's not much of a challenge "

after a hiatus of about fifteen years , the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest  
in early 1997 , there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone , one on television and two in the theaters , with dante's peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar  
of the two , i had heard that dante's peak was the better film , so i decided to check it out when it was released on video  
the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town  
the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption  
flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky , crushing homes and people  
we see people panicking , people crying , and even horses rearing  
it is a disaster of biblical proportions , signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road  
symbolism doesn't get much more blatant than that  
we learn that harry dalton ( pierce brosnan ) , a volcanologist with the u  s  geological survey , was there with his wife when the eruption occurred  
harry survived , but his wife did not  
a few years later , harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante's peak , washington ( which , we are told , has been voted second most desirable place to live ( under 20 , 000 ) by the readers of money magazine )  
there harry meets rachel wando , a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante's peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop  
although the mayor doesn't seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up , a few members of the city council are  
they are afraid that harry's presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante's peak  
they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug  
however , when an amorous young couple takes a skinny-dip in the local hot springs , they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath  
thus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption  
this film contains a number of cliches  
the amorous couple is one  
as soon as they doff their clothes , you know they're going to die  
the town busybody and the abrasive mother-in-law make appearances , as does the death-defying dog  
countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable  
watching the movie , i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements , but some of the dialogue as well  
unfortunate , since much of the dialog is terrible  
for example , harry's boss , paul ( charles hallahan ) , and a team from the u  s  geological survey join harry to assess the situation  
paul basically tells the townsfolk that harry's eruption predictions aren't cause for alarm  
this causes harry to leave in a fit of rage , only to turn up the next day , ready for work  
when paul asks harry why he stayed , he says with grim determination , "" cause this town's in trouble and i'm the best man you've got  "" 
even better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving  
he likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water  
if the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up , however , the frog won't move and will allow itself to be cooked  
 "" is that your recipe for frog soup ? "" 
asks one of the team members  
 "" it's my recipe for disaster , "" responds harry  
dante's peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious  
our heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid  
mayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming , in a very grave tone , "" acid eats metal  "" 
thanks for the tip  
when we first see the u  s  geological survey building , there's a caption labeling it as such  
this wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads , in large letters , "" u  s  geological survey  "" 
i suppose the caption is for people who can't read signs  
although harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film , the viewer has no idea why "

-1,"when considering david fincher's latest film , "" the game "" , four words come to mind  
 "" don't believe the hype  "" 
this michael douglas vehicle , from the director of "" seven "" , isn't nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe  
the film draws us in with an intriguing concept ( aided no doubt by the riveting trailer ) where a jaded millionaire ( douglas ) is presented with the opportunity to enter into a living fantasy  
this isn't simply virtual reality  
this is real life with a deadly twist  
on his 48th birthday , nicholas van orton ( douglas ) is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother , conrad ( sean penn )  
conrad has a special birthday present for his brother  
he hands nicholas a gift certificate and tells him to contact a company called consumer recreation services  
 "" they make your life fun , "" conrad tells him  
nicholas humors his brother , telling him he'll call , but it's clear he has no time for any foolish , "" fantasy role-playing , "" as he calls it  
then , for reasons that are never really made clear , nicholas decides to go to crs and see what they're all about  
he ends up spending a whole day going through their screening process , which to me made no sense considering the tight schedule he keeps claiming to have  
nevertheless , when it seems nicholas has been rejected as a crs client , the weird things start happening  
of course , when we've only covered about 30 minutes of screen time , what else should we expect  
douglas has built his modern career around playing powerful , violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands  
one of those films , "" basic instinct "" , came from the creative minds of writer , joe eszterhas and director , paul verhoeven  
the premise of "" the game , "" is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film , "" total recall  "" 
in that case , the premise was implanting someone else's memories as a way to enhance one's own life through a dream vacation  
yet , in both films , the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the audience  
we live the adventure along with the protagonist , reacting to each twist and turn  
in theory , the key to the suspense is not being to tell what is real and what isn't  
all we can do is hang on until the end of the ride , when the truth is finally revealed  
now , for those of you who forgot , let me say this again  
 "" don't believe the hype  "" 
 "" the game "" is not a thrilling roller coaster ride  
as a suspense-thriller , it doesn't do much but spin in circles  
by the third reel , i was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as i endured the predictable plot  
is it any wonder douglas won't be able to resist the charms of a mysterious , potentially life-threatening blonde ( ever heard of glenn close ? 
no ? well , how about sharon stone ? 
thought so )  
if anything in this film surprises you at all , i would guess you haven't seen that many films  
there is no suspense here  
trust me , i looked hard to find some  
i had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations  
fincher aim's for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas  
there are those that might say "" the game "" is not intended to be viewed literally  
i would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film  
the film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues  
there is a moment early in the film where van orton , realizing his game has begun , smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out who's in on the whole thing  
he is charged by his paranoia  
he is looking at the world through new eyes  
it is the last thought-provoking moment in the film  
from there on , the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us  
any significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into a plot device  
at the outset , we're told each "" game "" is tailored to the individual  
ultimately , this "" game "" is supposed to work like a crucible , trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire , proving his soul  
yet , as douglas endures his personal gauntlet , we're given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is  
i wanted to like this film more than i did  
i look at it as just anothergreat idea , poorly realized  
i can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film didn't mean we were seeing what was really happening  
bryan singer's "" the usual suspects "" for one , a film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas  
also , there is the underrated "" jacob's ladder , "" with tim robbins , a film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism "

-1,"let's get this one over with as quickly as possible  
if there was a possibility to receive a refund , this review would not be forthcoming  
but as it is , "" godzilla "" is without a doubt the loudest , longest , and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio  
producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves , and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch "" last year at merienbad "" until they can grasp the idea of content and plot  
no amount of hype , no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine ( billy the kid vs  
dracula )  
 "" godzilla "" opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs  
we are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship ( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins )  
well , the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature  
later , a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache ( jean reno ) interview the sole survivor  
in a state of shock , the only thing the man can utter is the word "" gojira "" ( the japanese name of the famed beast )  
we are then introduced to dr  nick tatopoulos ( matthew broderick , with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film )  
he is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population  
he is immediately drafted by the u  s  military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature  
in a short amount of time , another fishing boat ( loaded with canned tuna from the u  s  and korea for some reason ) is found grounded in jamaica  
well , it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york  
when the beast finally appears , he tears up one building , stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert ( thumbs up for new york )  
the military , with dr  tatopoulos's help , have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system  
it finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr  tatopoulos who snaps the beast's picture  
the monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting , and the chase is on , with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage  
working from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple , dr  totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated )  
well the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant  
needless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster's nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city ( even though the monster isn't dead yet )  
i sincerely hope that i've completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film  
i gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour's wage on this tripe  
everything about "" godzilla "" reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast  
the script ( and let's be clear here ) by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years "" razzie "" award  
the dialogue between maria pitillo ( as audrey timmonds , dr  tatopoulos' estranged girlfriend ) and mr  broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed )  
the film could be enjoyably campy if it didn't take itself so damn seriously  
but to what end , as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature , nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind  
no  godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it  
the film is bleak and ugly looking  
taking place at night during a rain storm , the movie has little or no depth  
everything is ugly and dark  
new york has never looked so inhospitable since "" death wish ""  
in an attempt to give the film some color , audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue  
the only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica , where dr  tatopoulos finds himself standing in a giant footprint  
the scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up  
you know from the outset that nick is standing in a footprint "

mercury rising adds to a growing list ( including such stinkers as the jackal , last man standing , striking distance and the last boy scout ) of stale actioners he has headlined  
and though mercury rising tries to spice things up by throwing an autistic kid in the mix , it is every bit as stale  
art jeffries ( bruce willis ) is your typical tormented fbi agent  
you know the type , haunted by his job , yet so good at what he does that even physically assaulting another agent merely gets him a slap on the wrist  
enter simon ( miko hughes ) , an autistic boy , who , like rain man and all other autistic people , is a savant  
he can merely gaze at a super-encrypted message , and , while little computer beeps go off in his head , he can understand what it says  
naturally , this talent has brought him to the attention of the federal government  
lt  col  nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) , an nsa official bubbling over with evil , has spent countless time and money implementing the newest "" unbreakable "" code , mercury  
however , when two of his underlings ( robert stanton and bodhi pine elfman ) publish a mercury-encrypted message in a puzzle magazine as a final test of its effectiveness , simon cracks the code  
naturally , this infuriates kudrow , who sends a terminator-like hitman ( l  l  
ginter ) to eliminate the security hazard  
and that's where art jeffries comes in  
for some reason that's never explained in the film , the fbi is called in to help , and through a series of intricate machinations , art becomes the sole protector of the young autistic boy  
in a few unrealistic sequences , he enlists the aid of a stranger , stacey ( kim dickens ) , to help out , but she is given very little to do overall  
the central concept behind mercury rising is ludicrous  
why bother trying to kill the kid    i 
mean , who would know ? 
it's not like the kid ( or anyone else for that matter ) knew he was cracking a government super-cypher  
and even if he is eliminated , what does that help ? 
he's already proven that mercury can be broken  
there's always the chance that someone else would crack it    but 
i guess without a kid in jeopardy , there's not much of a movie here  
for all its faults , the film actually starts relatively well ( once you pass the painfully familiar teaser )  
the film flirts with developing real characters , and a semblance of a plot    then 
mr  terminator the hitman appears and everything begins going downhill    quickly  
miko hughes does a decent job , for his age , at creating a touching performance  
however , don't go to this film looking for any new insights into autism ( not that many people will )  
instead he merely becomes the latest unique partner in a routine buddy-cop movie ( think cop and a half    with a twist ! ) 
willis and baldwin are just overplaying to type  
rather than creating a nuanced character , baldwin simply oozes sliminess  
and for willis' part , he simply recycles the stock role of the loner cop/fbi agent ( which he has honed in the die hard series )  
as almost an afterthought , about halfway through , the film carelessly gives him a character trait ( an addiction ) , and then drops it in the next scene  
but the biggest problem with mercury rising is the screenplay  
this film wasn't well thought out at all  
the film goes to extraordinary lengths to pad in as many convenient coincidences as possible  
the carbon paper scene alone is unworthy of the most gullible audience member  
at first the bad scenes just trickle in , but by the gruesomely bad finale they're a veritable flood "

dr  d's rating : critical condition ( 
okay , here's the deal  
i'll be the first one to grant that everybody needs a day off now and then  
i'll even go so far as to say that a vacation is a necessary part of doing any job well  
i mean , hey , i've been known to stretch a weekend into a three-day outing , if friday looks to be a slow day  
and if monday ain't looking like a pick-me-up , well , i've been known to give martha nell a call and say , "" do me a favor , sweetheart  
bump old man ferguson's boil lancing to tuesday morning , and tell miss audrey that i'll swing by her house monday evening and see if we can't get her trick knee back in line  "" 
a simple sentence like that , and i've got a nice four-day fishing trip with the boys , or more often than not , a trip up to cherokee , n  c  , for jackpot bingo and assorted other mountain funnery  
but the point is , if you take a day off , do something different  
if you've worked yourself silly for months , relax a bit  
sleep in  
eat pancakes at noon  
microwave an egg in its shell  
watch pro wrestling with the sound off  
listen to some barry white records at high speed  
whatever  
but do not , under any circumstances , spend your vacation doing the same thing you do for a living

because i do not want to hear your sob stories , oliver stone  
you apparently thought you needed a break from making "" important films  "" 
cool  
so you found this hinky little book and decided to make it a movie  
that's cool , too  
but , ollie , old sage , do not take a good story and a hot cast and make one of the most pointless and worthless films of the decade  
i'm just eager to meet you one day , so i can buy you a stoli , look you in the eye and say , "" what in the wide world of sports were you thinking with u-turn ? "" 
and i'll stand there staring 'til i get a straight answer  
sean penn stars u-turn , as bobby , a drifter who's had some troubles a while back  
he's heading cross the desert minus two fingers when his mustang ragtop blows a radiator hose , stranding him in superior , arizona , held there by an "" ignorant , inbred , turtleneck hick "" of a mechanic named darrell  
while darrell puts a new hose on the ride , bobby walks into town to see what's cooking  
is it needless of me to say that superior , arizona , is not exactly the shiny scrubbed home of all things lovely ? 
probably not  
bobby meets up with grace ( jennifer lopez ) , who invites him back to her place , for drape-hanging and other domestic issues  
just as those issues are starting up , grace's husband , jake , storms in , looking like check-out day of the elks lodge convention

the story is a straight shoplift of red rock west , a cult favorite a few years back from john dahl , maker of the phenomenal the last seduction  
but the contest doesn't end there , guys and gals  
we get steals from russ meyer movies , where everybody in town is horny and sweaty  
we get the town from bad day at black rock , minus the train , plus busty women who can speak  
look at any schwarzenegger film , and you'll see our hero , bobby , as bobby has a mudhole stomped in his keister a dozen times , has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times , gets bit by a tarantula , gets shot at , and ends up with vultures circling overhead , all the while getting up like he just got a shaving nick  
bobby as terminator ? 
stretch it a bit , and we have a five-finger discount from doc hollywood , where the whole story occurs because of car trouble , forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic  
okay , he's working from a book , so maybe ollie's not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas  
i just expect a man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative  
i just wish he hadn't brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toe-stub  
sean penn gives a great performance , and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be , playing over-the-top caricatures of stereotype characters "

-1,"from a major league baseball radio broadcast , featuring play-by- play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown , with special guest commentator james berardinelli  
hc : as we go to the top of the 8th , we're joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli , who's here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie , major league : back to the minors , the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors  
nice to see you , jim  
as a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer , can you give us the scoop on the new flick ? 
jb : my opinion : the producers should have stopped while they were ahead , and that was nine years ago  
one entry was definitely enough , and i'm surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2  this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct-to-video  
it's worse than a mediocre made-for-tv feature  
i should also mention that this movie likely won't play all that well in cleveland  
now that the real indians are perennial contenders , they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks  
actually , most of the action involves the twins' aaa minor league club , the buzz , rather than the actual major league franchise  
hc : sorry to interrupt , jim , but we still have to do play-by-play for the game on the field  
leading off this inning is john warren  
he steps into the batter's box and takes kent's pitch low for ball one  
wh : so , the story's strictly minor league , right ? 
what's it about ? 
jb : scott bakula , the guy from quantum leap , plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell  
when twins owner roger dorn , once again portrayed by corbin bernsen , needs a new manager for his aaa team , he offers the job to gus , who is now faced with two daunting tasks : turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson ( played by walt goggins ) for a promotion to "" the show  "" 
with the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano ( dennis haysbert ) , rube baker ( eric bruskotter ) , and isuro tanaka ( takaaki ishibashi ) , gus gets the buzz on the right track  
in fact , he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the big-league club , leonard huff ( played with over-the-top relish by ted mcginley )  
soon , dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus' overachieving group against huff's overpaid , last-place bunch  
wh : can we guess who wins ? 
jb : the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when you've already seen the box score  
on top of that , none of the mock-ups are presented with much flair  
they're not just boring ; they're lackluster  
but the major league movies have never been about drama or tension ; they've been about using baseball situations to generate laughs  
hc : warren fouls off a fastball  
1 and 1  
wh : are there lots of yuks in this one ? 
jb : not one , from start to finish  
i enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny  
okay , a lot of the jokes were sophomoric , but they made me laugh  
the two sequels haven't just been stale , but their humor quotient has been abysmally low  
even bob uecker's once-sharp one-liners have turned lame , and they're the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing  
hc : here's the 1-1 pitch  
looooooong drive ? fair or foul ? foul ball ! 
the count goes to 1 and 2  
wh : does the film at least get the baseball details correct ? 
jb : yes  
there aren't any glaring errors like there were in one of the best-ever baseball movies , the natural  
but i'd gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story , believable characters , or even a little genuine humor  
heck , the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league : back to the minors  
wh : it's nice to see old friends one more time , isn't it ? 
like cerrano , tanaka , and dorn  
jb : depends on whether you really care that anyone is back  
there aren't any real characters here ? just an assortment of cliched oddballs  
yeah , the voodoo hitter , the catcher who can't throw back to the pitcher , the japanese player , and the conceited player-turned-owner have all returned , but who really cares ? 
they have no depth  
notable absences include tom berenger's veteran and charlie sheen's "" wild thing  "" 
we don't really miss them , though  
hc : breaking ball , low and outside  
2 and 2  
wh : so you're saying that we should give this one a miss ? 
jb : that's right  
to use baseball terminology , it's a three-pitch strikeout  
if you're looking for a good movie that involves baseball , try popping the natural , field of dreams , bull durham , or even the first major league into the vcr  
actually , this is an oddly-timed release , since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in theaters  
even the minor league seasons are already underway  
don't bother with major league : back to the minors  
it's a wretched time- waster  
wh : thanks for the advice "

-1,"the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities  
the best tales of the genre deal with mankind's struggle for survival or knowledge  
such popular and noteworthy tomes as "" stranger in a strange land "" by robert heinlein , "" childhood's end "" by arthur c  clarke and "" man in the high castle "" and "" do androids dream of electric sheep "" by philip k  dick all deal with man's need for identity and struggle for self worth  
hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu ( if not the message ) of science fiction since it's beginnings  
most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved  
it really wasn't until producer george pal , took charge of robert heinlein's novel "" rocketship galileo "" and crafted the film "" destination moon "" , that 'sci-fi' ( as it is commonly referred to ) , came into it's own  
from there , such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick , have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre  
with the release of touchstone pictures "" mission to mars "" , we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci-fi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe  
the film opens on a summer barbecue , as phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission  
woody blake ( tim robbins ) and his wife terri ( connie nielsen ) commit to his coming authority on the mission , and luc goddard ( don cheadle ) consoles his son  
entering the party is jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife , maggie ( kim delaney )  
luc consoles jim with woody's assistance  
the three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them  
but jim still longs to set foot on the red planet  
the mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars  
they send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface  
going out to investigate , luc and his team approach the famed 'face on mars'  
a strange noise emanates from the rock  
as the team tries to scan through the rock with radar , a violent wind storm erupts , creating a vortex that kills all members of the team , save for luc  
back on the space station orbiting earth , woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing  
luc's interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team  
the second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger  
meteorite showers , explosions , and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet's surface  
the big question is , is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars  
and if so , what is its relationship with us ? 
now for the bad news  
the entire plot of "" mission to mars "" is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe  
the famed 'face on mars' becomes the centerpiece of the film , revealing some of the most harebrained sci-fi pabulum the screen has witnessed  
borrowing ideas from such films as "" robinson crusoe on mars "" ( 1964 ) , quatermass and the pit ( 1967 ) , "" 2001 : a space odyssey "" , and even mario bava's "" planet of the vampires "" ( 'terrore nello spazio' ) ( 1965 ) , "" mission to mars "" is a hodgepodge of ideas that don't add up to a satisfying whole  
while some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed , the film remains flat and un-involving  
so much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film , but to no good use  
the performances are all workmen like , with only don cheadle ( as luc ) carrying any sort of real chemistry  
gary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation  
and the mistaken idea of having jerry o'connell ( as phil ohlmyer ) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse  
and the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better  
he's just having too much fun here to give a damn  
the script has a few lapses , namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower , no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage  
this of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship  
also , when one character sacrifices himself , the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation  
but the biggest offence in the film is the horrid , intrusive score by ennio morricone  
subtlety is non-existent here  
in fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out  
the only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower  
the pacing of the film is very leisurely  
after the opening introduction of the characters ( which lasts a full 22 minutes ) , we are finally dropped onto the martian surface  
then , there is another long pause in the plot for more character development , including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity  
the film could lose about 30 minutes and actually gain some momentum  
there are so many scenes of talking heads , discussing what we already know is going to happen , that it drags the film to a dead stop  
the good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at  
the vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring "

ewan mcgregor - codename : "" eye "" - is pointing a high-tech rifle-ly gadget at a fat , bald business-oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across the street  
we get the requisite electro-green through-the-sight view  
we the audience , seeing a high tech rifle-ly gadget , of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target , but instead , he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy , low-quality photographs , which eye then proceeds to fax and e-mail to everyone in his target's office  
all right , so thirty seconds in , i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle/camera , but i was still open minded    
maybe there's a really good reason for it  
i've got reason to believe , you see - i admire a lot of ewan mcgregor's previous work    
and he's obi wan ke- friggin-nobi for god's sake  
and director stephan elliot's last movie priscilla , queen of the desert was a quirky little delight  
there's some genuine talent involved here  
i think at the twenty minute mark , there was still a spark of hope in my heart  
eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization's son ( i still have no idea what this organization was - british intelligence ? 
national spy ring ? 
private investigation ? ) , who is apparently stealing from his trust fund  
he has received his assignment from k  d  
lang , through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase  
when eye tracks his target to an expensive- looking secluded house , he witnesses a mysterious and beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) take a knife out and proceed to stab the poor bastard  
ok , that's odd , i think to myself , this could be interesting  
then she starts to cry , and through her tears exclaims "" merry christmas , dad ! "" 
for the first time  
so begins our tale of obsession    
or    something  
the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor's eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states , totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar  
throughout his entire professional life , he has been a voyeur ; so when he falls for someone , the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras  
fine , that's a lovely premise , i suppose  
but gosh darn it , if you're going to go there , you better have some sort of explanation  
and that's precisely where this film fails  
this is the kind of movie that pisses me off  
it's an abortion , a collection of half-formed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end  
it pretends it is something that it is not - a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a high-tech thriller  
here , the filmmakers have confused "" surreal "" and "" deep "" with "" vaguely unclear "" and "" crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors  "" 
i never , even for an instant , had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in "" love "" with this woman who changes wigs and kills people  
the movie offers only two explanations , neither of which make a lick of sense  
explanation number one : the obnoxious presence of eye's imaginary daughter , who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago , tells him he shouldn't leave ms  judd  
explanation two , which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie : "" beauty is in the eye of the beholder  "" 
whoo hoo , that helps , thanks a bunch , case closed  
that's as deep as it gets , folks  
there is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes , which , instead of tying everything together , ends up being as profound as a clever sixth-grade mad lib  
there are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was  
my personal favorites include : the prison-matron modeled after austin powers' frau farbissina , who apparently taught ms  judd everything she knows about wearing wigs ; jason priestley's awfully played dirty desert vagrant #1 , who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet , but fails miserably ; and the cop-who-sees-ashley-fleeing-an-accident-scene-and- then-wants-to-pay-for-sex- but-is-shot  
each one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last  
the script pays no attention to the laws of time and space "

-1,"if anything , "" stigmata "" should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly-themed films relatively close to one another  
of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year , it is clearly the worst  
i suppose i should have seen this coming  
after all , "" blair witch "" thoroughly creeped me out , "" sixth sense "" was mildly spooky , and then "" stir of echoes "" had its moments , but wasn't anything i'd lose sleep over  
clearly , the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping  
is it then any surprise that "" stigmata "" is the dullest , most horribly executed piece of mtv-influenced tripe i have seen in a long while ? 
no , not really  
patricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe-trotting mother  
as it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently-deceased brazilian priest  
the priest's church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue  
father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue  
his investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ  
father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie' s story , considering she's an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on  
he eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church  
as it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a "" fifth gospel "" before they were excommunicated  
the new rupert wainwright music video  
  
  
i mean film "" stigmata "" is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse  
indeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it's only interesting for about five minutes  
i'm not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion , double-exposure , and extreme close-ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school  
his camera trickery is interesting for a little while , but eventually , it becomes headache-inducing  
what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is ) , with wainwright screaming at the audience , "" see ? 
look at what i can do ! 
i'm an ex-cellent dir-ect-or  "" 
maybe then he'd explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! )  
if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn't see it  
just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double-exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever  
arrrrrrrghhhh  
  
  
then again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn't bother me if "" stigmata "" had a story or characters that were remotely engaging  
though wainwright's vanity certainly doesn't help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script  
where are plot continuity and character development when you need them ? 
case in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with , but we aren't given any back story on her character , or any reason to like her  
the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she's kind of cute , so let's start the bleeding ! 
the fact that she's clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn't help , either  
according to frankie page , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ? 
go clubbing ! 
sure , that makes sense  
arquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking  
scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable  
even though frankie page's life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon  
even more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances  
father andrew's religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic  
as for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , "" i'll get you , my pretty , "" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded  
trust me , i'm not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain  
what's worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible  
first of all , the film doesn't even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details  how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ? 
how come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ? 
actually , i'm not sure what frankie was posessed by  
supposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think )  
which one is it ? 
the answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr  wainwright wants to use this time  
furthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church  
if you do any research at all about the gospel of st  thomas , you'll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library  
there's nothing the catholics need to worry about , though  
 "" stigmata's "" religion is so off-base that it can't be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church "

-1,"i can imagine how good krippendorf's tribe must have looked on paper  
it does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors , led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director ( todd holland ) , all wanted to make this film  
in fact , it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf's tribe as possible  
in retrospect , i can imagine how bad this film could have been  
i shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss  
dreyfuss plays james krippendorf , an anthropologist who is granted $100 , 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea  
halfway into his two-year expedition , his wife ( apparently ) dies  
i say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established  
later , we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big-screen tvs and other such pleasures  
so , when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely , he decides to construct an elaborate lie  
he makes his own tribe , using his three children as actors in a video  
he simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe ( which he calls the shelmickedmu )  
audiences at krippendorf's lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision  
and proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community  
like all films like this , the lie becomes more and more complex , and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero  
dreyfuss is a funny , talented man , and he is funny in this film  
he has lots of positive energy and , unlike most comical actors , really manages to play people like this realistically  
this film also requires a lot of physical humor that i've never seen dreyfuss perform , and he does a great job  
jenna elfman , who plays veronica mecilli , a scientist who wants in on krippendorf's work , is also very funny and appealing here  
and the kid actors are great , as well  
but we're talking about the script from hell  
this is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen  
but the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it  
all the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew  
no , the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and mean-spirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched  
furthermore , the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless  
take , for instance , the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex  
they get all decked out in the tribe getup , complete with paint to darken their skin  
krippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe  
now , i saw this scene coming from a mile away , but i said to myself , "" no , that would be far too tasteless  
there's no way they'll do that    oh 
god ! "" 
they did do it  
it's there  
i was almost more appalled by the fact that this didn't bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film  
i found it deplorable  
and when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it , he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice  
the film is filled with scenes like these  
they not only insult the audience , but they insult the types of people that the film portrays  
it would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists , yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon  
and watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining , but i think that most members of the on-screen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes  
if i were an anthropologist , this film would insult me immensely  
moving right along , the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes  
sure , dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is really funny , and it allows for some entertaining scenes , but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes  
it is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film  
his character here is not a good subject for a film because he is a shameless liar , and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does  
i suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case , but for the purposes of good taste , i would have expected something  
no , this man sets a terrible example for his kids and colleagues , and the writer of the film ( charlie peters ) didn't include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad  
in fact , it's his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing , and he continually shrugs off her warnings  
i suppose it's important to admit that this is a funny film "

it has to be  
the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider  
bad movie syndrome struck me again , so after witnessing how much "" battlefield earth "" has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles , i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first-hand  
is it as bad as advertised ? 
oh yes , very much so  
the plot is incomprehensible  
the acting is atrocious  
the special effects are mediocre  
the action is dull  
the implausibilities are legion  
the dialogue is cringe-inducing  
the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny  
i don't even want to continue reviewing this movie ; i'd like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible , but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory , so here it is : 
the premise is basically a rip-off of "" planet of the apes , "" only minus the apes and philosophical discussion , and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo  
the year is 3000 , the psychlos have conquered earth , and the human population has been enslaved  
only a handful of humans escaped to radiation-rich areas to escape the aliens ; they live out their lives in fear  
one man , johnny goodboy ( i know , i know ) tyler ( barry pepper ) , ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos  
there he confronts the psychlo head of security : a big , ugly , klingon-looking creature called terl ( john travolta )  
pressed into slavery , johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back  
meanwhile , terl is faced with his own problems : he has recently learned that he's stuck living on earth ( which he hates ) for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man's daughter  
he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology ( this is where the plot gets ridiculous  
  
  ) 
so the "" man-animal "" can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos can't go  
terl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself  
of course , his plan doesn't work  
so many things wrong with this movie -- where to begin ? 
how about with travolta , whose hollywood clout brought about this , the cinematic version of scientology guru l  ron hubbard's sci-fi novel ? 
early previews for "" battlefield earth , "" with constant shots of a makeup-laden travolta cackling like lex luthor , had me ( and several audience members ) remarking , "" what the hell is travolta thinking ? "" 
the movie did nothing to stem such remarks  
all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here : terl cackles after nearly every line , and so does every other psychlo  
of course , this makes every scene hilariously overwrought , no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary  
the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america , but ceos generally don't laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees  
 ( "" you were going to be promoted -- but now you're not ! 
fwahahahahahahahaha ! ! ! ! ! "" ) 
it's no big surprise terl loses to the humans -- he's an idiot  
he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book  
he underestimates his enemies , assuming he'll win just because he's smarter  
 ( he uses the word "" leverage "" like some sort of scientologist mantra  ) 
not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero , he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos' language and technology  
 ( why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me  ) 
he then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him  
no wonder this guy never got his promotion  
the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention  
why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive ? 
how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open ? 
how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1 , 000 years ? 
and how do all these previously brain-dead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly ? 
there's a whole lot more to scratch one's head about in "" battlefield earth  "" 
bring a scorecard to track the plot holes  
director roger christian shoots "" battlefield earth "" in the most distracting way possible , tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason  
all the characters appear to be standing on the walls , and it's awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue  
the action sequences are atrociously edited , every one turned into an endless slow-motion parade that drains all potential excitement  
are these things really so hard to construct ? 
my respect for supposed "" lightweight "" action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in "" battlefield earth "" how badly an action sequence can be shot  
this movie is an absolute headache  
it's not just the shot selection and editing ; the movie , quite frankly , makes no sense  
for most of "" battlefield earth's "" running time , i just didn't know what was happening  
it didn't have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical ( though they certainly are ) -- i really had no idea what the hell was going on  
when i pieced the plot together later , it didn't look any better  
here's how much of a disaster this is : "" battlefield earth "" is already the worst movie of the year , and it's going to take something really , really inept to top it "

this one belongs in saturday morning cartoons    
extended review : you know , about halfway through this movie , i realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes , you'd have a damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy , hong kong style martial arts  
beautifully choreographed by robin shou , who also plays liu kang , the fight scenes are both mind-blowing and graceful , acrobatic enough to make olympic gymnasts weep  
this is what made the original so fun , but unfortunately for the sequel , we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson  
instead , they got john r  leonetti , the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat  
not a good choice  
while the fight scenes are brutal and eye-popping , the rest of the movie looks like standard made for tv fare  
the acting is sub-par , which i could endure if it were not for a  ) the director's style , b  ) the special effects , & c  ) the treatment of the story and characters  
a  ) mr  leonetti should go back to lighting , in my opinion  
i could say dozens of bad things about him : he way overuses slow-motion , he has no eye for action , he can't get even mediocre performances out of actors , and so on  
but by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping  
apparantly , everybody can now fly  
hell , i'm all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick and whatnot , but not when it happens every few minutes , and is done so poorly  
better jumping and acrobatics has been seen in xena : warrior princess  
in short , they should have gotten paul anderson back  
or at least let robin shou direct    
b  ) unlike the first one , whose sfx were vibrant and somewhat realistic , mk : a's special effects are bland , fake looking , and overall just plain bad  
i counted at least half a dozen times that blue-screening was painfully obvious  
had this movie been made in the 80's , it would have been ground-breaking  
but in today's industry , it doesn't even look finished  
c  ) now for the _really_ bad parts  
i admit , i'm an avid fan of the mortal kombat series  
the games are amusing diversions , an easy way to work off stress and anger  
the first movie was a mindlessly fun thrillride  
this could have been a really cool movie  
it isn't  
the writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower the target audience from teens to preschoolers  
some of the plot elements are just plain stupid  
how stupid ? 
take , for instance , how our heroes move around  
they use giants spheres the roll around underground , supposedly at thousands of miles per hour    oh 
boy    
even worse is the treatment of secondary characters  
blink and you'll miss 'em  
most characters had more depth in the video games "

-1,"m : i-2 , the sequel to mission impossible , is a james bond wannabe film , but it fails to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertainment value  
it tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it's an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses  
it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human  
the coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols  
the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence  
except for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed  
as for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen  
m : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue  
the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point  
the only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film's supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way  
it's a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series  
but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance  
john woo ( "" broken arrow "" / "" face/off "" ) is good at doing car chases , choreographed fights with midair flips and kung-fu kicks , slo-mo shots of two guns blazing , and of fire explosions , but he just can't seem to handle dialogue and suspense  
the star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast  
cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one  
their romance didn't work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn't convincing  
the film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success  
we will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney , the american southwest , and seville  
first , we are in sydney , australia , where a scientist with a muffled russian accent , dr  nekhorvich ( rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it  
he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain  
which explains the film's mythic theme    as 
we enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil  
the one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role  
at least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense  
soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains  
before they crash the plane and parachute out of it , the one who was posing as dimitri , turns out to be sean ambrose ( scott ) , a rogue member of the imf , which is a cia-like clone  
he steals the package with the antidote , peels off a latex mask , which is a replica of the hero of the story , ethan hunt ( cruise ) , who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust  
sean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices  
we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel  
woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain  
it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense  
next we are in a mountain range in the american southwest , and ethan is on vacation , hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool , when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard , delivers via a rocket launcher , a pair of talking sunglasses  
hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help , billy baird ( john polson ) and luther stickell ( ving rhames ) , with luther running a high-gadget computer , but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall ( thandie ) to join his team  
he is told , as an incentive to recruit her , all her criminal charges will be dropped  
hopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self-destruct in five seconds  
actually , with the departure of hopkins , it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at this point  
in seville , hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase , where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road  
he also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal , and learns that she is valuable because her ex-boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f * ck her  
the imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f * ck him , as she leads them to his hide-out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort , the south african , hugh stamp ( richard roxburgh )  
robert towne , the screenwriter , who contributed to the first "" mission , "" who is noted for doing "" chinatown "" -- writes a colorless , pedestrian script , one that fails even to be funny in a camp way  
the terrorists , who aim to rule the world , are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options , as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote , insuring that they will make billions on the stock  
ethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah , with his only conflict being who is more important to save first  
ethan does this rescue against all odds , as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company , fight it out with sean and the other terrorists , and rescue nyah , who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean's getting it , as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle  
ethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle , using kick-boxing , winning a shootout , throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists , making some more use out of that peeling mask bit , and by being completely fearless and larger than life , while he kick's everyone's ass

-1,"the above is dialogue from this film , taken almost completely in context , and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is  
it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film , and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about , especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously  
mr  gregg "" i'm-having-a-mid-life-crisis "" araki , the writer and director of this film , wants to show how important teenagers are , and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible , horrible world  
and how does he show it ? 
by really cheap surrealism , and moronic exchanges like this  
oh , and it gets better  
a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of , oh i dunno , the fiftieth sex scene in this film ( i'm not counting the several masturbation scenes )  
in it , one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another , and he says to her something along the lines of "" do you ever wonder what life is all about ? "" 
sorry , man : foreplay takes place before the act of coitus  
of course , what do you expect : the film was written and directed by a guy who can't even spell his first name right ( yes , i know it's a cheap joke , but it had to be done )  
 "" the doom generation "" is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them , and also as another "" teen angst "" film ( one of the slogans is "" teen is a four-letter word "" - hardy har har )  
it's a film about two angsty teens - amy blue ( rose macgowan , who would later play the buxom tatum in "" scream "" ) and jordon white ( james duval , who would go on to play randy quaid's son in "" independence day "" ) - who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac , xavier red ( jonathan schaech , who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in "" that thing you do ! "" 
- and by the way , do you get the symbolism ? 
red , white , and blue ? 
huh ? 
huh ? ) , and go on a road trip where three things happen , in no order : 1 ) they have sex ; 2 ) they run into weird people ; 3 ) they kill them  
the film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films  
gregg araki obviously has seen such films as "" easy rider , "" "" natural born killers , "" and "" kalifornia , "" and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide  
but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not , or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper  
 "" the doom generation "" doesn't want to do this ; it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level  
he wants to show everything in a weird manner , and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about  
here's one scene , an earlier scene in the film : amy and jordan go into a quick-e mart type place to get food and other stuff  
amy is smoking , and the clerk , an asian man mind you ( i love how racist this film is , i really do ) , tells her to put it out  
she tells him to fuck off or something to that note  
he points a shotgun at her , and she puts it out reluctantly  
jordan makes two hot dogs , and takes them to the counter  
the cash register rings up "" 6  66 "" 
 ( oh , and this symbolism doesn't stop here )  
jordan checks for his wallet but it's really in the car  
he asks amy for it , but she left her wallet in the car as well  
the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money  
they say they don't have it  
he gets ready to kill them , but then xavier , who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before , pops out of nowhere , fights with the clerk , and ends with him blowing the clerk's head clean off ( clean wound , mind you )  
the head is shown flying through the air , and lands in a fryer , where it begins to scream  
i don't really object to this kind of sick violence , but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only : to gross you out  
araki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme , he'll make some kind of art  
wrong  
it takes a kind of resistance to make gore art  
when george romero made "" dawn of the dead , "" a very gory flick even for today , he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick  
same goes for peter jackson's disgustingly gory "" dead alive , "" which features a 30 minute long fest of blood , guts , dismemberments , flesh chewing , and other assorted stuff , all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body , taking out all sorts of zombies  
it was sick , but it was also satirical , and controled  
a scene like this has no purpose in the film , and it sticks out from everything else that happens  
here's a couple other scenes : jordan and amy have sex in a bath tub and xavier watches , masturbates , and then licks the semen from his hand ; xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window , masturbates , and falls backwards ; a man attacks the trio , and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword ( put there just so this could happen ) ; a fast food employee stalks the trio , and his arm is shot off by xavier ; and various other annoyances  
also , look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people , who probably didn't really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it ( just like peter o'toole , helen mirren , malcolm macdowell , and john gielgud probably didn't when they signed to be in "" caligula "" )  
people such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt , alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel , hollywood madam heidi fleiss , christopher "" peter brady "" mcknight , amanda bearse , and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds , then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line  
why are they here ? 
so that we can all point to them and say "" hey , look it's ( fill in the blank ) ! 
wow ! "" 
gimme a break  
the film's meaning is pretty easy to detect : that , you know , teens are so precious , and the world is such a horrible place , that when the two entities collide , there's a giant explosion of horrific violence  
otherwise defined as "" teen angst , "" or the belief that being a teenager is a horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you  
look , i'm 19 years old  
i went through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did  
i've since moved on to "" i don't really know what to do with my life "" phase , but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks they're dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse  
part of being a teen is experimenting , and testing the waters  
it's not whining about how awful parents are , and purposely feeling dispondent  
this is what the characters in this film do , and the film wants to show how they're these great people who are being punished by the world because they're teenagers , and how they try to defend themselves but can't totally overcome them  
it's not their fault they kill people ; it's the world's ! 
what they really need is a reality check  
the world is a bad place , and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting "

 "" runners "" take bets from potential lottery winners and deliver them to private locations for drawings  
the undisputed leader of the harlem numbers is the madame queen ( cicely tyson ) who is challenged by dutch schulz ( tim roth ) , a ruthless hoodlum  
by turning against the queen , dutch defies his partner , the infamous lucky luciano ( andy garcia ) , who wishes to respect the queen and keep the peace  
the queens' army strengthens when an acquaintance , ellsworth "" bumpy "" johnson ( lawrence fishburne ) is released from prison and becomes a bodyguard for her  
he proves himself worthy in short time as he thwarts an assassination attempt ( on himself and the queen ) , and later takes control of the queens army when she is jailed for tax evasion  
bumpy's reign is not as restrained and subdued as the queen and he declares all out war on dutch  
bloody gang warfare ensues  
bumpy faces many obstacles during his reign  
his new army questions his methods  
his girlfriend ( vanessa l  williams ) and the queen disagree with his violent solutions  
most importantly ( in his eyes ) , dutch has become a more formidable foe than he imagined , and seeks help from lucky luciano to assassinate him  
there have been so many movies dealing with organized crime that it must be hard to write an original story dealing with it  
this movie is not original at all  
in fact , i was angered by how many similarities there was between this film and , arguably , the best gangster movie of all time , the godfather  
if you are going to borrow ideas from another movie and not give credit , why not borrow from a lesser known movie ( say , millers crossing ? )  
how could the credited screenwriter chris brancato not give credit to mario puzo himself ? 
here are just some of the major similarities ( i stopped counting at 10 )  
crooked cop assaults blood relative of the leader  
gang extracts revenge on crooked cop  
wife ( or girlfriend ) questions her partners' murderous activities and leaves him  
high ranking "" officer "" betrays the leader  
blood relative of the leader murdered  
war erupting between the "" families ""  
high-ranking officer disapproves of the leader in front of other family members  
new leader runs family differently from previous leader  
large meeting with all families involved  
the setup in this movie is done rather well  
i enjoyed the portrayal of the network of "" runners "" sprinting through the streets collecting bets for the queens lottery  
this was the way of life in harlem , and most people involved with the queen did so because it was the only way to support their families and put food on the table  
number running was the only way for the harlem population to find work  
i also enjoyed the interaction between the angry , violent dutch and the calm , patient lucky  
after about the 30-40 minute mark all of the similarities with the godfather start appearing , one after the other ( and in short order )  
it was a huge distraction , and an insult to my intelligence  
who was the screenwriter kidding here ? 
some of the individual performances were well done  
andy garcia was very convincing as lucky , unfortunately his screen time is reduced to a supporting role  
tim roth effectively plays the cocky villain , much like his roles in "" the cook , the thief , his wife and her lover "" and "" rob roy ""  
the good performances and convincing setup during the first third of the movie do not make up for the lackluster story that follows  
a couple of coincidences is one thing , over a dozen is an insult

the ozone layer has long since gone and the earth is now protected from radiation by a shield invented by connor mccleod  
the shield , although saving lives , has made the atmosphere hot and humid  
connor is a mortal and a tired old man who has given up hope  
on returning from the opera one night connor is accosted by the leader of a "" terrorist "" organisation  
they have tried to find out what the company that now runs the shield unit are covering up  
connor is then attacked by two assassins sent by katana from the planet zeist ( like zeit--get it ? )  
they fail and connor becomes immortal again by chopping their heads off  
he then brings ramirez back to life in glencoe in scotland  
both ramirez and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment  
connor now has the option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found immortality and fight to find out about the company and the shield  
katana meanwhile , fearing connor would return , sets out himself to kill the highlander  
if you have never seen it  
being a fan of highlander and mr  connery , i was in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii : the quickening  
i wish it had been quicker  
i feel whatever else you can say about a film ( bad script bad music , etc  ) if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs to be said  
the film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so ( the time mr  connery is on the screen for ) is worth watching  
the plot sounds a little ridiculous but i was willing to give it a chance  
maybe they could pull it off  
instead , i find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first film  
it's as if they are different people with the same names  
witness connor jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance -- where is the attitude of "" who wants to live forever , when love must die "" gone to ? 
the love sub-plot * must * have had footage cut out  
the highlander and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before  
putting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying  
i still want to know why connor's coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal ! 
we are not given enough time on zeist to believe in it , nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill  
why not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck ? 
i know the head needs to come off but you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles first  
to be fair one assassin tried this but he must be the world's worst shot  
meanwhile connor develops luke-skywalker-like powers of laser beam deflection  
as for "" bad guys , "" we see a rebellion on zeist , crushed easier than a grape and then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist  
two assassins are sent , presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged connor kills them both with no problems  
no more assassins are sent  
katana , supposedly a very powerful man goes himself to kill connor  
has he no more assassins ? 
has he no better ? 
why was the rebellion crushed so easily then ? 
michael ironside is totally unconvincing ( bring back the kurgan )  
he seems like a cartoon character and really isn't that evil , just stupid and violent  
we see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening a child again and killing lots of innocents  
yet he still seems like no threat -- perhaps because he seems too stupid to threaten connor , or maybe because his two best assassins wouldn't have been amiss with larry , curly and mo  
so much for plot and characters  
the music is atrocious  
it is at best intrusive and at worst annoying  
bring back queen  
there was an audible sigh ( of relief ? ) 
when connor played a queen track in a juke box  
i believe this at least is to be corrected for the american release  
the acting is at best flat , except for mr  connery  
lambert is uninteresting and when he delivered "" there can be only one "" this time around it just made me wish there had only been one -- highlander  
michael ironside is unconvincing ; sorry , michael , i usually like you and everyone else was incredibly forgetable  
so why 2/10 ? 
visually the film is interesting at all times  
it has a blade runner feel to it and some of the special effects are quite stunning "

the garbage known as "" snuff "" films ? 
nothing , right ? 
what's to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography ? 
well    nothing  
so , why make it , hollywood ? 
there's no reason why the average , sane movie-goer will be interested in such a topic  
no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this  
the lack of quality filmmaking in "" 8mm "" ( from technical to acting ) stands out even more when you consider the star , writer , and supporting cast--all reputable  
but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again ! 
like paul schrader , schumacher has his moments , but they're few and far ( far ! ) 
between  
basically , this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it  
why not walk out ? 
well , this wouldn't be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie  
here's why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of "" 8mm ""    
first thing--if you don't heed my advice , then understand what you're about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud  
it's not easy to watch  
i didn't know the details of the story beforehand , but at least my ignorance can help others now  
the ( ha ! ) plot revolves around tom welles ( nicolas cage ) as a surveillance expert and private investigator  
a rich old woman discovers a "" snuff "" film in her late husband's safe  
she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl ( it had to be a young girl , didn't it , schumacher ! ) who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead  
she's horrified that her husband would have owned such a film ( in 8mm , of course ) and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find  
family-man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque "" murder ""  
let me backtrack for a moment  
see , "" snuff "" films are pornos with a violent twist--people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead  
however , the deaths are often staged and , in those cases , special effects and "" good "" acting make all the difference  
very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard-to-find movies  
the thought of this "" industry "" makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review , but i'll swallow my bile and move on  
welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry  
you'd think he's sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him ! 
he comes across smut clerk max ( joaquin phoenix ) who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze  
after a lot of digging and bribing , welles finds the men who are responsible for making this , and other , "" snuff "" films  
skip ahead , skip ahead , skip ahead    
led by dino velvet ( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance ) and star-torturer "" machine "" ( christopher bauer ) , they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue  
the movie doesn't end there , unfortunately , because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films do--become a vigilante  
this film doesn't draw you in  
it keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close ? 
it is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ( ie  
 "" se7en "" ) , but it takes a large measure of restraint ( schumacher has none ) and a larger amount of talent ( schumacher has little )  
by those jabs , i'm not only referring to his stylish destruction of the "" batman "" franchise , but "" a time to kill "" was an immensely overrated disappointment  
for a guy who gets so much studio money , his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled  
a good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter  
writer andrew kevin walker didn't recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for '95s twisted thriller , "" se7en ""  
director schumacher doesn't have that innate ability to make you watch things you don't really want to see like better directors are capable of doing  
he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don't see is more frightening than what we do ( especially when it's a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered )  
however , gratuitous is joel's middle name  
he must think that not flaunting a hard-core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint  
no , he doesn't go that far , but we see enough unpleasantness  
he doesn't leave much to the imagination  
it's manipulating to hurt ( or kill ) young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante  
the script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters , yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ( ha ha ! ) 
craft  
case in point , a shot of a christian fellowship bus ( good , right ? ) 
drives away to reveal one of the villains ( bad , right ? ) "

trap a varied group of people on an isolated location , then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one  
these have been the successful ingredients for many good films ( the thing , alien , aliens , and tremors to name a few )  
so , why is it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad ? 
 ( see the relic for a particularly putrid example  ) 
perhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient : effort and ideas  
deep rising meets these two requirements part way , but not enough to salvage the film  
treat williams is finnegan , the leader of a small boat crew who hire out their services ( and their boat ) for any activity    no 
questions asked  
this time , however , they may have gone too far  
their passengers , led by the ominous wes studi , are the type of multi-national terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films  
and their cargo    let's 
just say it has very high explosive potential  
what is the target of these thieves ? 
why , the argonauticus , of course , a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage  
but something else is hunting the argonauticus    something 
ancient and deadly  
by the time the thieves arrive , nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed  
and now the creature senses fresh meat ! 
so , you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew , joining forces with the surviving passengers ( including the ship owner canton ( anthony heald ) , and a thief with less lofty goals , trillian ( famke janssen ) ) against the terror from the deep  
and the monster gets to pick them off one by one  
fortunately for the creature , this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer  
why else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food  
if there's a more clarion call for unity , i don't know what it might be  
it's pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when  
there are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the end  
for the most part , the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audience's impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first  
 ( although i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou's life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad  ) 
treat williams is a passable hero , and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation  
but while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy , very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way  
the biggest treat in the film , however , has to be pantucci , kevin j  o'connor's whining engine-boy , under finnegan's employ  
his constant quips may be a bit over-written , but they manage to capture the same vein of nerve-addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens ( or todd graff as hippie in the abyss , for that matter )  
it's just a stock part ( the comic-relief character ) , but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable  
as far as the monster goes , although the cgi is done well , the creature has no logical consistency  
think back to the great ( or even just good ) movie monsters  
they all had a set of "" rules "" about what they could do , and how and why they would do it  
part of the joy of those films was slowly discovering , along with the heroes , just what those rules are  
the tentacle monster in deep rising doesn't have a set of rules    
or if it does , not a very good one  
it merely eats ( or drinks , as the case may be ) , and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order to do so  
the film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place  
it simply happens  
the action scenes are decent , but few are noteworthy  
the film definitely does suffer from its proximity to titanic  
deep rising's peril in the water scenes pale next to cameron's ( but can you really blame them ) "

-1,"the u  s  army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done  
one particular field manual is known as the fm 22-5 , which among other things , covers the practice of saluting  
under the "" saluting "" section is a sub-section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer  
the salute is rendered by the highest-ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail , and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail  
in any event , the salute is rendered only by the man ( or woman ) in charge , rather than by the whole group  
almost at the very beginning of the general's daughter , we see a general's motorcade passing a work detail  
everyone salutes  
it looked impressive , but it just wasn't right  
that little bit showed me that someone either didn't do the appropriate research , or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene  
in fact , this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture , as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie  
what results is a film that looks good , but like that one scene , just isn't right  
the first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example  
paul brenner ( john travolta ) is an agent for the army's criminal investigation division , undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale  
prior to the transaction , the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isn't the unscrupulous supply sergeant he's supposed to be , and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living  
so ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark ( we'll just say that it involves propellers )  
brenner then receives new orders when the commanding general's daughter , captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , is found naked , bound , and dead on one of the base's training ranges  
he is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder  
what i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary  
it gives no insight into brenner , other than the fact that he's a little cocky  
does the arms subplot turn up later ? 
no , so why add this extra running time to the film ? 
the answer : it looked cool  
or how about the "" atmosphere "" ? 
the beginning of the general's daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees , dirt roads , sultry colors over water - all backed up with bayouesque music  
nice immersion in the setting , but it soon doesn't matter , for when the film's plot shifts over to the murder investigation , so does the entire mood  
no attention is paid to the location of the story , and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme  
did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ? 
instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film , we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another , just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside  
the above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie  
as i've already mentioned , an entire section of the film doesn't jibe with the rest , and the characterization only adds to the difficulty  
brenner , who comes across as a man with little respect for authority , suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell ( james cromwell ) and utters some of the corniest "" yes , sir "" s i've ever heard  
he even delivers an emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general's daughter , even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous  
sunhill , who initially comes across as a professional investigator , utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information , and even revels in her ingenuity  
both characters are protagonists , but it's hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place , and in some cases , simply unappealing  
i could imagine that during filming , west would shoot a scene , then take the actors aside and tell them , "" let's do it again , but this time , i want more  "" 
i say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good , in this film they overact in most of their scenes  
an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general's aide , colonel fowler  
i swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention  
a far cry from his days as linc in "" the mod squad "" , i can't help but think he was acting from west's direction  
a couple of side characters including a west point psychologist ( john beasly ) and a young female private ( ariyan a  johnson ) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear  
the only two actors who seem to have escaped west's influence are james woods , who provides a good performance as colonel moore , elisabeth's mentor at the psychological operations unit , and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police  
woods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people's minds , and does so without ever taking it over the top  
hutton just kind of hangs around , but at least he wasn't overacting  
i haven't read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based , but i'll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form  
the movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space , or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished  
every time we're presented with some new aspect to the case , west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it's the most momentous discovery ever , but the information is not used by the investigators at all  
instead , when conclusions are drawn , they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts , but lucky guesses instead  
the army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill , letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects , then letting them guess who the killer was  
would've been over in a half hour  
the film finishes with a sort of bookend , featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning  
literally during the closing credits , we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off , then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off  
they both seem kind of happy "

kewl    now 
i only wish that i could pretend never to have seen this movie    
critique : trite , unfunny , boring and a waste of everyone's talent  
how a premise with such zest and bite can turn into a movie that doesn't feature any chemistry , any real laughs , any surprises or any spice is beyond me  
how julia roberts is used solely as a "" puppy dog "" character , puttering around in the background while we endure the complete bitchiness of zeta-jones' character , who is not one bit funny or romantic ( two ideal ingredients in a "" romantic comedy "" ) , is also beyond me  
and why they chose john cusack , a great , quirky actor in his own right , to play the most bland , uninteresting and unfetching character ( with zero chemistry with either of his leads ) is further more , beyond me  
and to anybody who decided that this project was "" funny "" enough to greenlight featuring the talents mentioned above , along with billy crystal , christopher walker , seth green and stanley tucci    well , 
what can i say    i 
just don't have the words  
so is this the worst movie that i've seen all year ? 
no  but it definitely sucks and it's basically because    well , 
it's just not funny  
and for the record , allow me to state a few more problems with it  
it starts off slow , it's got no energy , it doesn't engage you with any of its characters ( julia barely gets somewhat interesting in the film , everyone else    lame ! ) , it utilizes way too many flashbacks to move the story forward , it's utterly predictable , standard , routine , see-through and uninteresting as a plot and it just sits there on the screen , big and ugly , waiting    waiting for you to laugh or find something in it that is amusing  
and then hank azaria shows up    aaaaaah , the film's savior ( mind you , some might be offended by his exaggeration of a stereotype , but that's another story altogether )  
but when an experienced "" voice "" actor upstages all of the main stars in a summer "" blockbuster "" romantic comedy with an over-the-top antonio banderas accent , damn dude    your 
film's in trouble ! ! 
rent this movie on video just to see what went wrong yourself  
the references to ricky ricardo and senor wences ( huh ! ? ) , the idio-plot points like when one of the characters goes on the roof to stretch his arms out and relax , but everyone believes that he's going to kill himself ( hardy-har-har ) and the cheap way of getting the audience to leave the theater laughing by bringing back a ball-sniffing dog that has no place being in the location at the end of the movie , well    i 
could go on  
but i won't because i do still respect all of the actors in this film and actually did laugh at azaria , green and tucci's antics from time to time ( ironic , eh    what 
about the leads , dammit ! ) and liked the premise behind the film ( before i saw the finished product , of course )  
a dud all the way around  
btw , all the talk about this film was that julia roberts was to be in a fat suit for one scene ( her character is supposed to have lost 60 pounds ) , so when the scene finally came , i did get a little excited about what it might look like and then   "

ooooooooh ! 
she must then join together with her model-friends to find out whether or not this guy is really goofy-but-loveable , or a psycho killer

this thing stinks to high-heaven

pure hilarity !

this movie sucks the big one  
it's chockfull of stupid characters delivering inane dialogue fitting snuggly into a preposterous plot

it's supposed to be funny , see ? 
you see , that person then has their legs swinging in the other person's face as they drive and that distracts the driver , see , and well , that's kinda funny , no ? 
harumph    yeah , 
well    you 
get the picture ! 
anyhoo , freddie prinze jr     nuff 
said  
monica potter , a bad career move , but we might forgive you if you keep up the julia roberts bit  
the rest of the model girls    well , 
thanks for being there so i had something to look at , but please apologize to the entire modeling community as a whole , for making them all out to be complete imbeciles ! ! 
so why the three points out of ten , you may ask ?

battlefield earth 
a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman 
in my mid-teen years , i had a horrendous re-occurring nightmare  
behind the wheel of a car , i was driving down a straight road in the middle of a desert  
no scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway  
no matter what i did , the view didn't change : travelling but not getting anywhere  
each time i awoke in a sweat , terrified  
you don't have to be carl jung to understand that dream  
powerless to make changes , trapped in a boring situation with no hope of rescue , this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake  
this is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after "" battlefield earth "" begins  
for all of its flash and style , l  ron hubbard's science fiction epic is the earliest and best entry for the dullest summer film of 2000  
dull "" and "" stupid  
in the year 3000 , the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for 1 , 000 years  
humans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as barbarians  
there's no hope  
the future is bleak  
then the psychlo make a mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry pepper ) who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl ( john travolta ) and the alien race  
it's an archetypal post-apocalyptic plot full of promise  
considering some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen , it's difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably  
but it does  
the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits  
are we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold , the psychlo never discovered fort knox ? 
or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time -- and gassed up ? 
or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships ? 
or that the psychlo spy cameras somehow don't notice that their slaves are missing for days ? 
travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he's worth and is almost entertaining  
almost  
the rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person -- "" man-animal "" or not -- would ever utter  
some of the film _looks_ good , but it also looks so familiar  
a race of large hulking ape-like creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin  
sound like something charlton heston might be in ? 
the psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from "" dune ""  
the final air battle between the air force fighters and the psychlo ships in their high-tech city is something george lucas might have been associated with  
it's too loud  
it's too oppressive  
it's too slow  
it's too long    far 
too long  
and on it goes  
the list of the problems with "" battlefield earth "" is endless  
it's difficult to find anything in the film that does work  
oh yeah  
the color scheme is nice  
the real question is how this movie ever got made  
could it have something to do with the fact that l  ron hubbard was the founder of scientology ? 
and that john travolta is a member of the church  
that might explain why travolta bought the rights to the novel years ago  
but it doesn't give us a clue as to why first-time screenwriter corey mandell's atrocious script was used  
or why the high-profile project was entrusted with roger christian who had never before directed a major film  
or why no one looked at this thing before it was released and realized there might be problems  
the one bright spot is that no longer will kevin costner's "" the postman "" ( which i begrudgingly admit as a guilty pleasure ) be "" the "" big budget science fiction failure  
 "" battlefield earth "" has the honor sewed up  
often reviewers will recommend that you skip mediocre films and wait for the video  
that's not the case here  
you can act now and make the decision to not see it on the big screen or on the small one "

-1,"godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the "" who cares about plot "" summer movie  
a loose remake of the 1954 "" classic "" japanese monster movie , godzilla , king of the monsters ( which is itself pretty thin in the story department ) , roland emmerich and dean devlin's big-budget lizard-stomps-manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind  
the script isn't just "" dumbed down , "" it's lobotomized  
godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone  
presumably , the primary target group for this film is teenage boys , the demographic most likely to shell out $7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster-instigated carnage  
that's not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction ; they're just not as readily susceptible  
this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer-generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors  
stargate was a financial success  
independence day was a runaway hit  
and , with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie-ins before it even opens , it's virtually guaranteed at least $100 million  
nice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not-too-precocious grade school kid  
godzilla isn't completely without merit , although it is close  
there's a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan , but it wears off quickly  
frankly , while the special effects are competent , they're not all that stunning  
there's nothing new here ; it's jurassic park meets aliens , with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure  
maybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer-generated visuals to the next level  
godzilla never really pushes the envelope , preferring to remain within a comfort zone  
the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass , formulaic approach which disallows creativity  
 ( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival ? ) 
worst of all , godzilla isn't even exciting  
with the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end , there isn't a sequence in this film that raises the pulse  
even the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn-provoking  
independence day may have been dumb , but it was full of "" adrenaline moments "" capable of getting the audience involved in the action  
in this aspect of its production , as in so many others , godzilla is lacking  
actually , part of the problem is that we're never sure who we're supposed to be rooting for : the green monster with an attitude or the paper-thin humans trying to stop him  
the plot , such as it is , can be summed up rather simply  
after sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands , godzilla shows up in the big apple  
he does some of the usual tourist things : stops by madison square garden , visits the chrysler building , goes on a walk through central park , and takes the subway  
in the process , he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs , but he never has trouble with traffic jams  
on hand to stop him is an elite u  s  army unit , led by a slightly less-arrogant-than-usual military man ( kevin dunn ) and a biologist named nick tatopoulos , who has a theory about godzilla  
in his opinion , the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific  
in nick's words , godzilla is "" a mutated aberration ? an incipient creature ? the first of its kind  "" 
as luck would have it , nick's old girlfriend , audrey ( maria pitillo ) , is a reporter based at a new york tv station  
along with her cameraman friend , animal ( hank azaria ) , she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla  
then , just when the military has rejected nick's theory about why godzilla is in new york , a member of the french secret service ( jean reno ) recruits him for a special assignment  
instead of stomping around tokyo this time , godzilla has chosen new york city  
unfortunately , manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies ( independence day , deep impact , armageddon ) that it's becoming boring  
the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong , but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall  
he could climb the empire state building  
at ten times that height , godzilla would be more likely to knock it over  
godzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor  
there's an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sit-com material , an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick's last name properly , and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel  
both of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film : "" ebert , "" the mayor of new york , is played by michael lerner , and "" gene "" ( lorry goldman ) is his campaign manager  
ebert's re-election slogan is , not surprisingly , "" thumbs up for new york  "" 
the siskel/ebert stuff is amusing the first time it's used , but , after a while , it grows tiresome  
and , although the "" characters "" don't serve any real purpose , they keep popping up  
godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast  
this is largely because emmerich doesn't want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard  
that's not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren't capable of good performances ( both have done their share of solid acting in the past ) , but they aren't a-list names  
then again , considering the quality of the writing , even pacino and deniro would have been hard- pressed to shine "

-1,"the original _babe_ was my favorite movie of 1995 , a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience  
being a surprise commercial and critical success , it had no marketing tie-ins , which limited its final take  
thus , babe 2 arrives , with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1  
plush dolls , vending machines hawking t-shirts , and macy's thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday money-grubbing  
too late  
this is a sad review to write , because babe 2 not only does _not_ live up to the original , but it doesn't even come to a fraction of it  
i shouldn't expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors' magic , but this film tries too hard , and loses its charm  
consider a driver applying the accelerator with great intensity , unaware that his car is in neutral  
imagine with me , if you will , _scream_'s jamie kennedy , explaining the "" rules "" for sequels like babe 2  
 ( 1 ) there must be _more_ talking animals  
 ( 2 ) there must be _more_ slapstick comedy  
 ( 3 ) there must be _more_ songs for those mice to sing : that's cute  
 ( 4 ) keep the story cards to break up the action : that's cute too , even though "" the pig gets wise "" made no sense , given the context of that story partition  
 ( 5 ) there must be action , however illogical , that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original : the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to , the baa-ram-ewe secret code , the "" that'll do , pig  
that'll do  "" 
now throw in the limitations : ( a ) james cromwell , now a hot commodity , has limited time on the set ( or maybe he didn't approve of the script )  
 ( b ) christine cavanaugh , the voice of the original babe , demands more money ( $200 , 000--paltry considering the $80 million budget )  
out  
e  g  
daily comes in with noticable results  
 ( c ) george miller , the director , is more well-known for his dark futuristic mad max films and his twilight zone segment , not for kiddie fare ( and no , he didn't direct that _andre_ film in '94 )  
 ( d ) the special effects are impressive , _but limited_  
babe talks , but most of the time from a single shot , repeated over and over again  
 ( babe is center screen , looking straight into the camera , with a happy smirk--regardless of whether he's happy , or scared , or tired )  
season now with the "" original "" elements , which , as we will find out , are straight from the screenwriting-is-hell bin  
 ( i ) change the venue into "" the big city ""  
this has been praised as wildly original  
excuse me : didn't _home alone_ do this several years ago ? 
how about the muppets ? 
even _the bad news bears_ travelled to tokyo  
sorry  
no dice  
side note : to give the city a fairy-tale look , george miller crafted a fantastical fantasyland that merges the landmarks of the world's great cities , and yes , it _is_ impressive  
but this too is over-used , repeating the same view over and again on multiple occasions  
and , for the most part , babe _remains in the hotel_  
 ( ii ) given the limitations of cromwell , the human element is taken over by "" the boss' wife "" played by magda szubanski  
s-t-r-e-t-c-h  
she's not a lead actress-type , she's not funny enough in her physical comedy , and she's simply embarrassing in some of her pratfalls  
 ( have her arrested falsely on drug charges ! 
have her accidentally incite a riot with biker dudes and scantily clad babes ! 
have her bounce around on a bungee cord at a prestigious benefit dinner ! ) 
i was hoping for a little smirk during these scenes , but i felt sorry for the embarrassment that she put herself in  
i am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film , the violence , the scene where a pit bull dangles from the bridge , head submerged underwater  
even the best fairy tales have a bit of the macabre in it , as the brothers grimm have demonstrated  
no    my problem is with the story , or lack thereof  
_babe_ is sent out to save the hoggett farm , but once in the city , that story is forgotten  
being a good-natured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs is nice , but , other than rescue that aforementioned pit bull , what did babe actually _do_ ? 
without giving the ending away , the farm is saved from a left-field quirk that had nothing to do with the pig  
speaking of "" pig "" , or , "" pig-pig-pig-pig-pig ! ""  
the word "" pig "" is so overused , had they changed it to an expletive , and had the pig be al pacino , i could have been watching _scarface_  
this is screenwriting ? 
further , i cannot explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scenes where accidents happen to good people in fantastically elaborate setups  
had it been a cartoon , and the victim be an equivalent of elmer fudd , maybe my reaction would have been softened  
but to farmer hoggett ? 
his wife ? 
an elderly mickey rooney ? 
much too irreverent "

with the millenium just around the corner , hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century  
this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil  
the result is somewhat predictable  
i didn't have high hopes about arnold's "" much anticipated "" return to the big screen  
schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased , action lovers won't be bored , and the catholic league will be angry  
everyone else will see 'end of days' for what it is : a deliciously bad motion picture  
think of it as hollywood's own y2k bug  
did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you'll get 999 , as in 1999 ? 
yes , you better believe it   satan is here on earth , working on his latest project -- the end of days  
this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and , although not al pacino , he is fun to behold  
he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker , wreaking , as they say , havoc  
the way it works is he smirks and something explodes  
before the stroke of the new millennium he's got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations  
only schwarzenegger's cop attached to an anti-terrorist unit can stop him  
films like this has one serious weakness -- logic  
no matter how you twist the "" plot "" , you'll find it incredibly stupid ( even for a schwartzenegger movie ! )  
the incredible fact is that such directors never learn  
after thousands of headless productions , this theme has become one big clich ?  
here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution  
he is walking around n  y  , blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius  
all he wants is the girl , that is somehow special  
but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks , he has hidden her in a church , where satan dare not enter  
so the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information : "" you can have your wife and daughter back   i 
can give you happiness that you can only dream of   just 
give me the address   "" 
indeed with a script like that , you could make a wonderful parody , but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously , attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller  
and for you who have awaited arnold swartzenegger's comeback , will not be very satisfied  
we've not seen him in a while  
that's because he didn't have a worthy opponent  
he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars  
he has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop  
so , after all those fights , what's left for arnold schwarzenegger ? 
how about satan ? 
in my opinion , he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in cameron's "" terminator ""  
and that is schwartzenegger's strength -- muscles and no emotions  
here he tries to achieve an artistic level , moving towards the oscar  
this is called "" an adult turn "" if successful and "" a flop "" if unsuccessful  
make a wild guess ! 
his character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems  
this requires at least some acting skills  
regrettably , the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles  
the rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters  
the movie is otherwise technically impressive , with a solid cinematography and fine lighting  
but the movie doesn't serve neither as a serious thriller ( because of its stupidity ) nor as comic entertainment ( because of its serious tone )  
the only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry  
the action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular "

i can't help but feel like everyone is looking at me  
it's as if all the audience is gazing at the back of my head in the darkness , eyes shooting daggers , quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hard-earned money to spend their time watching this    
this    
thing  
i shift uncomfortably in my seat  
i'm reminded of how i feel when i see a pair of second- or third-rate celebrities engaging in a teleprompted "" funny "" conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award  
it's not my fault , i know it's not my fault , but dammit , someone's gotta be embarrassed , because it doesn't look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame  
i'm about to give you a list of names of people who are gonna make a movie together : garry shandling , annette bening , john goodman , greg kinnear , mike nichols  
do any of these names make you instantly shudder ? 
the answer i would have come up with before today is no , this is quite a list of talented individuals we've got here  
granted , john goodman was in the flintstones , and greg kinnear has turned in some less-than-lackluster leading man performances in certified failures like a smile like yours , but even so , they've got proven power as excellent supporting players  
garry shandling has two television classics under his belt , his ingenious little it's garry shandling's show and the larry sanders show  
and for god's sake , mike nichols directed the graduate , and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty  
so explain this    
this    
thing  
what planet are you from ? 
purports to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole pop-psychology mars/venus phenomenon  
but what this movie winds up being is a collection of unfunny cringe-inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe-inducing moments ; the end result is , unsurprisingly , an unfunny , uninsightful , cringe-inducing , thoroughly icky embarrassment  
garry shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males ( they reproduce through cloning , of course )  
his leaders put a select group of males through a series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth , find a female of the species , and impregnate her  
they're taught how to pretend that they're listening by nodding and saying "" uh-huh , "" and how to compliment shoes  
imagine my delighted surprise when , oh heavens , all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably , producing comedic results ! 
the lucky winner is fitted with a penis ( since theirs , after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence    
i will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that they're all just clones    
whoops , too late  ) 
the penis , when aroused , tends to make a humming noise  
the writers , when frequently strapped for ideas , tend to turn to this as a source of "" comedy  "" 
it isn't funny the first time  
it isn't funny the eighth time  
it isn't funny the eighteenth time  
if anything , it made me feel vaguely self-conscious  
garry meets up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear , who turns out to be a generic , unlikable scumbag  
he's meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandling's alien character , but he's so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside  
kinnear's scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims other peoples' work as his own to worm his way into a vice presidents' position and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks  
wow  
what a magnificent bastard  
nearly every man in the movie , in fact , is played as the same sort of sex-driven slimeball  
when kinnear's wife walks into the office , there isn't a single guy who doesn't trip , bump into a wall , or otherwise pratfall as if they'd never seen a woman before  
the few guys that aren't particularly slimeballs , such as john goodman's detective character , are simply uncommunicative workaholics  
shandling meets up with annette bening , who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed , at one of kinnear's aa meetings  
shandling's mission is to have a baby , and when he reveals his desires to her , bening instantly falls for him , and the next day "

it tries to be twice as big as it's predecessor , yet ends up twice as shallow  
shallow     hmm    now there's an idea  
maybe if the ill-fated cruise liner in this movie had struck a shallow reef early on things may have turned out better  
the first thing that struck me    and 
surprised me , was that the camera work ( for the opening sequence anyway ) was terrible  
looked like the cameramen were drunk and kept tripping on their own feet       very 
different to the original movie  
the characters ? 
well , not many of the characters actually * had * characters , but here's a rundown  
annie , who was the highlight of the the original , must have seriously banged her head in the train crash at the end of the first movie  
why ? 
because something's got to account for her losing that many iq points  
even though annie wasn't exactly a rocket scientist in speed , here some of her actions just make you want to beat your head against a wall  
for instance , after successfully using a chainsaw to cut a hole in a door so that a group of people can escape noxious gases - she stands in the middle of the opening for about five minutes till someone reminds her that the people can't get ut till she get's the chainsaw out of their faces     bang 
bang bang 
in point of fact sandra's character is turned into little more than one of those scantly dressed extras from hercules , who constantly has to be rescued  
jason patric ? 
all i can say is bring back keanu  
keanu reeves might have the emotional range of a tree stump    but 
that's one more tree stump than jason has  
i don't think he changed facial expressions all movie - jason , smile for the cameras ! ! 
now frown !    i said frown     oh    you are    bang

-1,"for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer , hard boiled , face off ) appears to have made an exciting , elegant , charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them  
sadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two-hour long episode of magyuver  
and not a particularly good one at that  
what went wrong ? 
mi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it'll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise's firing gun just so they can die really cool  
early on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic  
in one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other's eyes with come hither sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff  
prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another  
why ? 
i haven't the foggiest  
i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply  
with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects  
it's possible that these "" spies "" could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored  
the scenes i've described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character  
god forbid  
woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial-like visuals  
still in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish  
cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is )  
between the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact  
the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us  
sure it's all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product  
thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that's about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight  
they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres  
newton bats her eyes flirtatiously  
cruise grins a little too slyly  
the cruise character , ethan hunt , has been drastically altered since the first film  
here cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1  
he's cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90's )  
sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise's initial "" i'm the man ! "" 
charm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug  
mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won't stop  
the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could've been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the "" symbolic "" pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture )  
we've all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand  
it isn't done any differently here  
the action is pure hard target \ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind  
he's cool for sure but he's made to be as empty as the movie  
the actor isn't used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one  
when he's not beaming away , he's staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell , but woo's editing seriously undermines the effort  
he fetishizes cruise's angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof  
i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he's really austin powers  
in a classic woo action moment , ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death  
the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise , basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does )  
the lead bad guy ( played by the appropriately british dougray scott ) and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken ? ? ? on motorcycles  
though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment , the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug , only to fly about a hundred feet ( still in bear hug position ) , land on a beach below and begin a mano-e-mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a "" so you thought i was dead    ""  
not to worry , cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat  
what a hero ! 
you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2's plot  
my reasoning is simple : i'm not sure of any good it would do  
the film itself has absolutely no concern with story , only with hurtling forth to the next "" special "" effect  
i wasn't kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video  
nobody will go to this for the plot , and if they do they'll surely regret it  
as summer movies evolve ( or devolve ) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing "

-1,"while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks  
and , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year  
the trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it's a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you've seen the animated series on hbo you'll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he's been sent to hell  
todd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else  
not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while  
every character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student  
the story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life  
al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d  b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him  
the next element in the film is the part when things go awry  
and as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al  
as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene  
inevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away  
hence , jason's mischievous master-mind plan , to ` conquer the world "" is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil's army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again  
so , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife  
time passes  
and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc    
this character is merely a poor man's obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla  
now the stage is set spawn , the new `enemy of evil' vs evil  
and evil takes the cake , doubtlessly  
john leguizamo's deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film's relief point  
all this anguish , pain , half-baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so-so one liners  
and then there's martin sheen  
whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years  
his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent  
as the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b-movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot  
this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street  
i'd never thought i'd be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen's career is in better shape  
spawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable  
for most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better  
it constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie  
continually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures are being made  
perhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry  
the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible  
the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting  
it is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton's batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act  
but bruce wayne had human elements to him  
he was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human  
the character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he's fatigued about being normal  
and as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary  
none of this is present in spawn  
the fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny-dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner's  
as an example of this film's vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic  
admittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that's when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum  
it is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature  
besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn  
movies that present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to  
and kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one  
children are not muppets "

your second clue that something isn't gonna be quite right with the movie you're about to see : charlize theron , one of the movie's dubious stars , makes an appearance on the daily show in which , when asked if her new movie's any good , she replies with the equivalent of a verbal sigh    
assuring us that , yeah , it sure is a movie , all right ! 
and there's some scenes like those you'd expect to find in a movie , and there's some action    
and there's other    
stuff    
too  
how to immediately grab my attention : open your movie with five dead guys in santa claus suits  
then show a caption reading "" six days earlier    "" 
ya know , i was honestly interested to find out what killed all those poor santas    
how to immediately lose my attention : follow your opening scene with a terminally dull nice-guys-who-don't-deserve-to-be-in-prison scene  
write a line for the one of prisoners like "" i just want to go home and eat christmas dinner and watch some ball with my dad  "" 
then , have ben affleck actually say that line , on film , and forget to leave it on the cutting room floor  
for good measure , throw in a poorly motivated prison riot and have affleck's best buddy stabbed    
aw    
and just two days before his release , too  
already the cliches are piled on thick , and when it rains , it pours  
how to take my attention , dash it violently against the rocks , and make it so that i'm contemplating my strategy for calling "" shotgun "" about an hour before i know the credits will roll : deny your characters the ability to think  
have ben affleck , for some reason i'll never understand , pretend he's his dead prison buddy so that he can get his girlfriend , played by charlize theron  
have gary sinise show up and force the two of them to participate in a poorly planned casino heist  
the villains' big idea ? 
kidnap affleck because he used to be a security guard at the casino , force him to tell you where all the doors in the place are , then dress up in santa suits , create some "" diversions "" and rob the place  
on paper , it seems like the stuff of a potential caper comedy , but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks he's looking at the makings for some sort of clever action-crime thriller  
it's not like the man isn't capable    
far from it  
he's the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may  
he wowed me with some the most memorable car chases i've ever seen in last year's ronin  
but he's certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers    
put reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his 1996 version of the island of dr  moreau  
step one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible : cast ben affleck in the role of the world's most generic hero  
he gets no good one-liners , he doesn't get to shoot or implode anything in new and interesting ways , and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as a car thief and wants a cup of hot chocolate and piece of pecan pie  
his name is rudy ( short for rudolph , in all likelihood "

-1,"i had an epiphany today  
it occurred to me while i was watching "" house on haunted hill  "" 
it is as follows : if a trailer makes the film it's advertising look like a trashy , stupid movie , well guess what ? 
chances are , there * is * truth in advertising  
too bad i didn't trust my own instincts when something-or-the-other possessed me to see this movie  
i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of "" sleepy hollow  "" 
that and "" dogma "" started too late in the afternoon for my schedule  
an hour of "" angel "" or "" buffy "" is scarier than this doozy that tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face  
i wish i'd seen it when it was halloween  
at least i would have been forgiving  
hey , tis the season  
the movie was scary ( albeit very confusing , dizzying , and nauseating ) at first , but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously wasn't going anywhere  
now i truly appreciate films like "" scream , "" "" halloween , "" or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic  
that's what spooks people out , the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know  
there has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with  
sure , utterly unpredictable is good , too , but that's different from utterly nonsensical  
hohh ( house on haunted hill ) , on the other hand  
  
  
well let's just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they oh-so-cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago  
riiiiight  
y'know , that just sends chills down my spine  
yeah  
just like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil  
ooooooo  
hint : blood and guts only work a few times  
sooner or later people start to tell themselves that it's just ketchup and props and you've got to come up with something better than that  
there were just too many things in this movie that we've all seen before ; from the inevitable "" plot developments "" of strangers unwittingly trapped together ; strangers turning against each other ; the evil manifesting itself ; the dead coming back for a last scare  
each was more predictable than the last  
why didn't these fools just stay together in one place anyways ? 
sheesh  
was i grossed out ? 
yes  
did i get spooked a few times ? 
yes  
but why ? 
i get really disturbed when there is no why  
when there weren't random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect ( which wasn't that good either , trust me ) and the scare , the film was filled with drab , laughable dialogue  
the characters were incredibly flat and cliched  
not to mention downright annoying  
you've got a bunch of people going nowhere in their lives ; of course they're dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night  
jeez , i thought no one fell for those "" you may already be a winner "" things anymore  
and of course , all three gals are babes  
i wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of "" shine "" ended up in this movie  
keep that up , geoff , and you'll qualify for the next batman venture  
the only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan because , well , he just cracks me up  
and famke jansen ( sp ? ) 
because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan  
pierce brosnan ( hey , i willingly endured "" dante's peak "" three times for him : )  
all right , i concede  
there were a couple of things i enjoyed  
that perverted little amusement park at the beginning  
i probably won't ride a rollercoaster for a while  
and the machine they used to drive geoffrey's character mad ( see , i don't even remember their names )  
the machine , not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it  
i kept waiting and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of the movie  
it wouldn't have redeemed the film , but at least it would have made me feel better "

i wanted to run away from that movie every minute  
but i paid my money and i owed it to others to see if the movie got any better  
so i stayed  
it never got better  
frequently , it did the impossible , and got * worse *  
the movie as written , acted , directed , and basically just feels as a whole like it's about on the mental maturity level of a free willy 4  the whole thing feels like a movie that only three-year-olds could enjoy    
except for the ridiculously gratuitous blood and gore , and pointless nudity  
it's written for little children , but children should definitely * not * go anywhere near it  
of course , i recommend the same for everyone  
don't go anywhere near it  
verhoeven's got a streak going now "

the following review contains some harsh language * * * 
the blair witch project  
quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time  
if you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace , because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy  
my colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more , then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more  
and this worked for him  
well , i'm sorry , but nothing    
is nothing ! ! ! ! ! 
nothing is not more  
it's nothiiiiiinggggggggggg ! ! ! ! ! !  
i do not pay 5 dollars to see nothing  
 "" nothing "" is free , available all around the world at a location near you  
i am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary  
i could just discount them and say , "" well , i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow  "" 
but i have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesn't hold water  
there must be some other reason  
 ( then again , maybe my first thought is correct , i think i'll try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction  ) 
when i hear people praising this film , i never hear them talking about what makes up about 97% of this movie : three kids bickering with each other about being lost  
they only talk about what might make up possibly 3 to 4 minutes of screen time  
this being a few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout "" josh ! ! "" 
over and over  
this film should not be called the blair witch project , it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost    
and argue with each other  
oh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting "" josh ! ! ""  
and if you thought that was scary , wait till you see a pile of rocks , and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs , oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear  
oh yeah , and some goo on one of their backpacks  
you've never seen terror like this folks , and you don't want to  
the chevy chase/goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film  
 ( for current films , i highly recommend the sixth sense or a stir of echoes for a creepy filmgoing experience  ) 
this film is an example of marketing with no substance  
the marketing was brilliant , and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film  
they want this film to be good  
and i think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they don't have anything else to praise  
that wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along , but this is not it  
this film could have been so much better  
just think , if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost , and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff  
i saw this movie with a girl who was extremely pumped for it  
she was sold on this film  
and then , at one point during it , she turned to me and asked '    are 
we supposed to be scared by this ? '  
i've heard one opinion that you "" have to use your imagination "" to create the fear in this movie  
well , i thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed to do  
use their imagination and create a good movie  
i mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay 5 bucks for it  
but even if you like this idea , then what are you imagining ? 
an entity called the blair witch ? 
some rednecks fucking with these kids ? 
are either of these things really scary when you think about it ? ? ? 
i've heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it can be to be out in the woods and hear something "

-1,"ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film ; i have a problem even regarding it as a film  
it's more of a show , a big commercial for ted turner's world championship wrestling ( wcw )  
the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page , goldberg , and sting  
the story is very minimal and basic  
there are these two guys , gordy ( david arquette ) and sean ( scott caan )  
they are two twenty-something wrestling fans from wyoming  
when they go to a live event for the big match up , there favorite wrestler jimmy king ( oliver platt ) is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus ( joe pantoliano )  
gordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus' plans  
on the way , they meet some people , have some fun , and clean up some port-o-potties  
sounds great huh , well it's not  
the movie makes many attempts at humor , only a few of them work  
the jokes that make you laugh , however , do not outnumber the film's many duds  
there is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa  
the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back  
i especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquette's tag team partner is 'macho man' randy savage  
they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor  
the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan  
mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl , the cheerleaders of the wcw  
she becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice , funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan's breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face  
now what didn't work in this movie ? 
that would be the rest of it  
the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets  
the two lead characters work for a port-o-potty cleaning company and when they crash the truck , the excrements spill all over the road  
it's not funny ; it's pathetic and brainless  
the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way  
i watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie  
the main characters in the film actually get to wrestle , like that would happen to any fan , especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set  
also , i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily ; they just walked right in  
i like wrestling  
i watch it at home and laugh  
it's continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldn't watch it  
this movie wasn't even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv  
the only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew  
the funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently  
the movie was too dim-witted to be funny  
it is possibly the most useless and under-developed film ever  
a recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film , detroit rock city  
that movie was interesting , well done and continuously funny unlike this film  
the acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh  
now that the scream trilogy is over , arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb 1-800-call-att ads  
at least he has a hot wife in courtney cox  
he's in the funny parts of the film but there aren't enough to make him look good  
the music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock's "" bawitdaba "" and "" cowboy ""  
martin landau has a great cameo as a classic , hard-nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne  
script is important to a film but this piece of crap could have been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin  
a fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it  
at times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real  
the wrestlers form alliances , go to people's houses and beat them up  
it's utterly ridiculous  
the whole film was a wasteful , dumfounding experience  
the movie was made to pay homage to the fans , telling them things that made wrestling , not the wrestlers  
the wrestlers are making more money to make a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a potty-humor movie "

-1,"14 years ago , national lampoon introduced us to a new family - the griswolds  
in 1983 , the griswolds embarked on a cross-country journey with the destination of wally world , a world-renowned theme park in california  
we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured  
two years later , we watched again as they went to europe , and four years after that , we shared christmas with them  
now , eight more years have passed , and the laughs have done more than die  
they've been cremated  
vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold , the good intentioned but ill-fated father of two  
the premise is basically the same  
clark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation , this time to las vegas  
his wife ellen ( beverly d'angelo ) and teenage kids rusty and audrey ( always played by different actors - this time around , by ethan embry and marisol nichols , respectively ) join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick  
of course a "" vacation "" movie wouldn't be complete without good ole eddie ( reprised by randy quaid ) , the misfit cousin , showing up at all the wrong times  
there isn't too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it  
it's really just a skit movie  
there are a couple of ways to define a skit movie , which is not a real term as far as i know  
the first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours , therefore coming off like a two hour skit  
the second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits , each lasting about five minutes  
vegas vacation comes off like the first  
a good example of the latter would be last year's black sheep  
the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast , and it doesn't really fit into a movie mold  
in these cases , a "" plot "" , which is generally very thin , is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags ( i  e  
have a good vegas joke , make a vegas movie )  
such is the case with this movie's mini-plots  
clark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold's money , ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton ( ! ) , rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage , and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie ( shae d'lyn ) as an exotic dancer  
the simple fact is : this movie isn't funny  
at first , i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes , but when the movie got rolling , my interest suddenly stopped  
chase plays clark griswold really well  
he made the character and he is the character  
d'angelo , to be quite honest , never was too impressive as ellen , and this movie doesn't show any signs of redemption  
as for the two new griswold kids , the word "" blah "" comes to mind  
the "" vacation "" series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters , the simple reason being that there is nothing to them  
they're so generic , you'll expect the credits to read "" girl #1 as audrey griswold ""  
vegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor  
yes , it's true that vegas vacation isn't even close to being close to being as funny as the others , which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways , but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart  
first off , why did they leave off the national lampoon's heading on the title ? 
i couldn't find any reasons why , but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn't want to be associated with such a lame film  
that's saying a lot , especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented : loaded weapon 1 , pcu , etc  if they expected this to be another hit , you would assume they'd be proud to tack on the notorious header , but for reasons only we can guess at , like the movie sucking , they didn't  
there is another difference here that makes an obvious impact  
the first three films in the "" vacation "" series were written by john hughes , a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80's including mr  
mom , sixteen candles , the breakfast club , weird science , pretty in pink , ferris bueller's day off , planes , trains , and automobiles , and uncle buck  
wowzers ! 
what a r ? sum ? ! 
looking at the names , you'd think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980's  
well that's not all  
this guy also brought us 90's hits including the home alone series , the remake of 101 dalmatians , dennis the menace , and the current flubber  
vegas vacation , however , didn't have john hughes behind it , and the loss is very obvious  
this time around , the script is in the hands of elisa bell , whose only credits thus far include four made-for-tv movies  
vegas vacation plays very much like one , and it would actually work much better as a made-for-tv sequel  
if this sounds like a wild idea , it's not  
revenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies , and they seemed like it  
vegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2 : 00 a  m  
sunday morning movie , but as a silver screen major motion picture , it's quite out of place "

-1,"synopsis : cro-magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion  
reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy-style , ayla grows up to become a blond , feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate  
comments : allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies  
she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner  
the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title  
not even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese  
it's so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it's oddly fascinating  
the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out  
the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m  auel  
to this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following  
i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother  
i have never read this book , but i sure hope it's 10 , 000 times better than its film adaptation  
if not , then i'm at a complete loss to explain its popularity  
the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene  
a young ayla , looking much like drew barrymore in e  t  , 
tramps about in the woods  
with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her , the audience's expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered  
what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla's mother ( a blonde with fur pants    er , 
leggings )  
tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera    well , 
as the earthquake slowly recedes  
a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch , but the screaming six-year-old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven  
i won't detail the story any further ; this seems enough to illustrate my point  
this movie is really stupid  
it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief  
also , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston  
the movie doesn't just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four  
a blond , gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs  
she's of the "" new people "" ; they're of the "" old people "" with "" the memories  "" 
yep  
we get it  
we get it  
the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up , which surprises me  
the movie depends upon a lot of make-up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing  
as stated before , daryl hannah is daryl hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time  
the rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt  
the face-painting that's occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind  
this movie also suffers from its new age trappings  
maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and cliched , like poorly conceived elevator music  
add to this the film's faux-mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you'd expect to hear on a 1-900 number , and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious  
the clan of the cave bear is rated r , though it's probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i've seen in quite a while  
it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity  
the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes  
the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear  
the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about "
-1,"various films seen at the seattle film festival : 
it's all true/three men on a raft ( u  s  a  , 1942/1986 ) director : orson welles 
a recently uncovered one-fourth of orson welle's planned "" docu-drama "" of amazing stories around the world named it's all true , this short dealt with welle's attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft  
while several clips of the film are seen , the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle's attempts to film it , despite studio problems , a staggering workload , and extremely ill fortune on the set  
impressive photography , but really only interesting to film historians  
sadie thompson ( u  s  a  , 1928 ) director : raoul walsh screenwriter : raoul walsh , from the john colton play "" rain "" , based on w  somerset maugham's story "" miss thompson "" cast : gloria swanson , raoul walsh , lionel barrymore silent 
after the discussion of the newly-restored version of frank capra's lost horizon , where several scenes had been restored using stills , i was interested to see sadie thompson , where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago  
this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story "" miss thompson ""  
this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen--little awkwardness , and a very clever script  
the actors : gloria swanson , raoul walsh ( who also directed and wrote the screenplay ) and especially lionel barrymore , as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie's soul , but really wants to get her between the sheets , is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel  
swanson adds real life to the character , adding an worldly , affectionate air to the bawdy sadie  
unfortunately , the ending is rather poorly tied up ; it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live-action film , or the original script  
the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on ( i cannot believe maugham's short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia ) ; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we've been waiting an hour and a half for  
still , it's entertaining right up to the end ; certainly barrymore's incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the silent screen ) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells , bakkers , and robertses of the religious worlds  
a c movie ; worth 2  50 if you can find it  
the pied piper ( czechoslovakia , 1986 ) director : jim barta screenwriter : kamil piza 
this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids  
it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate , and with a lot of political comment along with it  
perhaps economic content is a better word--it certainly doesn't show capitalism in a good light  
nor human nature , nor anything else , for that matter  
as you may have guessed , this is not a tgif film ; this is the kind of film you are glad is over  
not that it wasn't interesting for technical reasons ; this is stop-animation that is very well done  
all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts--except for the animated stuffed rats  
boy , sounds like a real comedy vehicle , doesn't it ? 
add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison , and you have something to give the wee ones ( and some of the mentally unstable larger folk ) to keep them up at night  
some gore  
don't bring children to this one  
don't bring adults to this one , unless they're fascinated by puppetry and/or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped  
blech  
  no fun whatsoever  
meier ( west germany , 1986 ) director/screenwriter : peter timm cast : rainier grenkowitz , nadja engelbrecht , alexander hauff , thomas besvater sub-titled 
this film takes us back and forth over the east german/west german border with meier , an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money  
his uncle ( also in the west ) sneaks meier out of the country , unknown to the east germans  
meier , however , is less than thrilled-- his girlfriend , his friends and his job ( which he likes ) all exist in east germany  
after a round-the-world trip ( his boss think's he's on leave in bulgaria ) , meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id , and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew's work--while everyone think's he's still living in east germany  
of course , something goes wrong--and the ending is very funny , but it takes the film too long to get there  
the humor is spread too thin , and much of the plot is too obvious ( as is the acting )  
still , a good concept for the comedy , and the last five minutes are pretty funny  
c -- $2  50  
the right hand man ( australia , 1986 ) director : di drew screenplay : helen hodgman cast : rupert everett , hugo weaving , arthur dignam , jennifer claire , catherine mcclements 
after a lifetime of movie-going , and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival , i've learned several rules which , while not absolute , should certainly be given deference to : 
1 ) be wary of french comedies  
these people like jerry lewis  
2 ) ken russell is never going to grow up , no matter how long you wait  
3 ) any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as "" old pouty-lips "" is probably not worth watching  
4 ) when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography , watch out ! 
australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo , but since weir and miller left for foreign shores , finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult ( not impossible--witness malcolm last year ) task  
well , i ignored rules 3 & 4 last night , and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards  
it's as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30's about tragedy among the gentry , and falling in love with people below your station , and horses  
lots and lots of horses "

book of shadows : blair witch 2 
a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman 
certain things in our lives are inevitable  
death , sorrow , love , heartbreak , pain , joy  
we expect these events  
we know they're going to happen and some , we even look forward to  
it's part of the human condition  
we have also become accustomed to inevitable occurrences in our society  
as we near the fall election , several of them are hitting us in the face  
politicians exaggerate their own importance  
our side is always right ; theirs is always wrong  
in the end , voters are usually forced to choose the lesser of two whocares  
in hollywood the one indisputable inevitable is that if a film makes big money , there will be a sequel  
even if the original story doesn't merit one  
even if the first film is complete in itself  
even if success is a fluke  
 "" the blair witch project "" was made with a budget of $1  75 and exploded on the screen , raking in huge profits  
the concept was brilliant  
the filmmakers created a remarkable buzz that the story might be real  
the film itself was even more convincing  
the movie _must_ be authentic  
why else would such amateurish footage be on the big screen ? 
the first film caught lightning in a bottle  
the sequel proves you can't pour that old lightning into a new bottle  
you have to give this effort some credit  
it would have been easy to have made the same movie again with a new group of kids  
it would have been easy , but of course , it wouldn't have worked  
instead "" book of shadows "" acknowledges the first film as a movie and concentrates on the hysteria following its release  
it's a great scheme and possibly the only entertaining way to do a sequel  
unfortunately it doesn't work either  
five kids spend the night in the woods at the scene of the first film  
weird stuff happens and they retreat to an old factory where one of them lives  
even weirder stuff happens  
some people die , there's blood and knives and none of the characters have a lick of common sense  
while supposedly doing serious research , the group sets up a circle of surveillance cameras in the ruins of the old house in the woods and vows to stay alert all night awaiting a visitation  
then they proceed to get totally trashed on drugs and alcohol and party down with very loud , very obnoxious heavy metal music  
it's a bad plan  
the cast shows some early promise  
a couple is doing research on a "" blair witch "" book  
the tour guide is a former mental patient turned ebay aficionado  
a goth amazon princess adds a bit of comedic relief  
the obligatory hot babe is the 2000 spiritual cinematic descendent of the cute hippie chick , the cute rock and roll chick and the cute disco chick : the cute wiccan chick  
the first film's unaccomplished actors came across as real people in a real situation because hours and hours of video were shot during days in the woods  
this time , these unaccomplished actors just come across as unaccomplished actors  
there's not one character you care about when they start shouting for no reason  
although what passes for a plot starts out with a solid idea , it's ruined by poor execution  
the follow-up to one of the most successful horror films ever is nothing more than a bad slasher movie  
they're trapped in an old big weird house  
they stupidly separate into various rooms  
there are strange noises , they see scary apparitions and people disappear  
ever see this movie ? 
seasoned documentary director joe berlinger should know better  
the film features mostly cheap tricks and unnecessary gore  
for a storyline filled with surprises , it's oddly predicable "

-1,"one of the responses those that enjoy "" detroit rock city "" ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i've given the film might be something like : "" oh , that casey's gone and become a jaded critic on us  
just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n' roll movie like this ? "" 
i'm wondering the same thing  
i feel like i should have had a grand time with "" detroit rock city  "" 
it's the sort of movie i wish i could've had a lot of fun with , but i didn't  
i just didn't  
surely this film isn't trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? 
no , but i expected something  
a funny joke  
a clever prank  
a plot development  
anything  
the movie never delivers  
you've got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing  
 "" detroit rock city "" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film's existence , and it's not a very satisfying realization  
the film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan  
that's it  
there is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot  
the characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington )  
they have a garage band  
they're pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n' roll , so i guess that means we root for them  
they have tickets , they lose them  
they get more tickets , they lose those too  
they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire  
there's not much more to it  
frankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity  
oh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency  
she doesn't want them to see kiss , if you hadn't figured that out already  
it's really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this  
we've got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy  
then again , "" maximum overdrive "" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time  
 "" detroit rock city "" doesn't quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close  
in fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind  
basically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc's "" highway to hell "" sounds like something my neighbor's cat coughed up )  
it's also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it' s evident that they're all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie  
edward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they've got to make a living in hollywood  
people wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song  
too bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess  
director adam rifkin knows he hasn't got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning  
we get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script  
it's fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting  
i would recommend that those who felt seasick at "" the blair witch project "" stay far away from "" detroit rock city , "" because the witch has got nothing on this baby  
i haven't felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since "" armageddon  "" 
and what about that script ? 
it's written by carl j  dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i've ever heard  
if it is , i can't say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible  
a plotless , pointless rock n' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny  
the jokes in "" detroit rock city "" rarely are  
in fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal  
the rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it "" comedy  "" 
there is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don't provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up  
it's as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , "" see ? 
funny ! "" 
look , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink  
see ? 
funny ! 
look , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver "

two men messily eat fast food as their septic truck leaks raw sewage directly behind them  
and roughly 17 people are booted in the crotch  
welcome to `ready to rumble'  
judging from the fact that potty-mouth adam sandler is the reigning box-office comedy champion , you realize -- albeit while shaking your head -- that yes , there is an audience for this sort of thing  
ladies and gentlemen , i weep for society  
mind you , when executed with style and comic ingenuity , jokes like an alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel ( `there's something about mary' ) and a laxative-induced attack of explosive diarrhea ( `dumb and dumber' ) can be extremely funny  
unfortunately , `ready to rumble' is not being helmed by the farrelly brothers , nor is it bolstered by a script that accommodates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or inspired  
`ready to rumble' is built around the dedicated fan-base of professional wrestling     
which , in fact , sounded like a fine concept for a goofball comedy  
but director brian robbins and screenwriter steven brill handcuff themselves , and limited to a stampede of asinine , humdrum bathroom humor , basically the only thing they manage is to evoke memories of pauly shore and `bio dome'  
gordie boggs ( david arquette ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) take pride in being hardcore wcw wrestling fanatics  
by day , they transport raw sewage  
by night ( particularly on ? nitro' monday ) , they pay homage to their personal hero and savior - jimmy king ( oliver platt ) , the undisputed leader of the professional wrestling community  
with two tickets to an upcoming nitro performance , gordie and sean are psyched about witnessing the king defend his title first-hand  
but unscrupulous boxing kingpin titus sinclair ( joe pantoliano , sporting long hair and cowboy boots ) has other plans  
sinclair is plotting to have diamond dallas page ( playing himself ) pummel the king into the tarp , thereby dethroning the dignified wrestler and embarrassing him in front of a bewildered auditorium full of fans  
gordie and sean are shocked , rioting madly while arguing `this isn't even a pay-per view event ! ! ' 
they take it upon themselves to track the king down and supply the encouragement essential for their fallen idol to make a come-back attempt  
along the way , you can expect a lot of sh-- jokes as well  
you may find something to like in `ready to rumble' if a ) you are a rasslin' aficionado yourself , or b ) you are a dedicated fan of the lowest of low-brow comedies  
i welcome low-brow humor with open arms - that is , if its fresh and resourceful  
`rumble' is nothing but a sloppy , frightfully unfunny swamp land of misbegotten retardation  
the first half-hour is the ultimate test of patience  
luckily , the simple-minded events pick up steam , particularly with the well-choreographed wrestling action  
director robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality and excitement of football in `varsity blues' , and when in the ring , he does professional work  
but the violence is too excessive  
having the fake soap opera of wcw wrestling turn into a bloody skirmish brings back unfortunate memories of owen hart's tragic accident just last year , especially with one character's dive during a cage match  
this is not something you want a comedy to be reminiscent of  
outside the wrestling action , the lewd jokes and puerile sight gags bring new meaning to the term ? scattershot' , while the dialogue fluctuates in on the vulgarity scale of 1 to 10 , with brill's extensive vocabulary ranging from `diddly' to `boob' and so on  
the final tally : i chuckled a few times , groaned a lot , and indulged in one spirited belly laugh involving martin landau as a geriatric wrestling coach who fights pretty impressively for 105  
casting-wise , `ready to rumble' is an odd duck  
oliver platt as a champion wrestling figure ? 
he's perhaps a bit chunky , but fellow wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him `fatty' , which dampens the blow i suppose  
rose mcgowan is fully disposable as a sultry wcw cheerleader ( `the nirto-est of the nitro girls , ' proclaims gordie ) , but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers goldberg , `macho man' randy savage and sting ( among others )  
wcw fans are sure to appreciate these  
others    
well , won't  
i found merit in david arquette's bountiful energy as gordie , which brings me to my finishing     
ahhh     
`praise' for the film : in `ready to rumble' , i have discovered something even more annoying than arquette's `at&t' television commercials  
now there's a low blow for you "

-1,"as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment , hollywood doesn't loose the oppertunity to get involved , by telling stories and expressing opinions  
this film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels , hays hodges ( tommy lee jones ) and terry childers ( samuel l  jackson )  
they fought side by side in vietnam , where childers saved hodges' life by shooting an unarmed pow  
that's against the rules of war but understandable , in this story anyway , under the specific circumstances  
certainly hodges is not complaining  
years pass  
hodges , whose wounds make him unfit for action , gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer  
childers , is now a respected and much-decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould  
because of his excellent record , childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ( ben kingsley ) , cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops  
childers does what he has to do : evacuate the family and protect the men under his command  
after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire , he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd  
more than 80 yemeni men , women , and children are mowed down  
childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians  
he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film  
did childers violate authorized u  s  military rules of engagement ? 
or are there simply no rules in war ? 
the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious , but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions  
the murder of 83 "" innocent civilians "" has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u  s  where is the accusations from the arab leaders ? 
where is the u  n  ? 
the film ends without even telling the most interesting story : what happens on the international arena ? 
this film ( in a way akin to films such as "" a few good men "" ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism  
these accusations are pretty heavy , but also unfair  
what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking  
one of the earliest apparent problems with 'rules of engagement' is its lack of credibility  
the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now , but is overdone , contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed  
a lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality  
that is precisely why it's not offensive  
it is completely unobjective  
many stories are started and never finished  
many questions are asked , but never answered  
a lot of parallels are referring to nothing  
it seems that neither the director , producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film  
is it about arab mentality ? 
america's foreign policies ? 
america's role in the world ? 
corruption in the higher circles ? 
it goes on and on  
it consists of countless stories , but not a definable plot  
it tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one  
i think that it is ironic , because director william friedkin's probably most acclaimed film was "" the exorcist "" which had a silly story , but became a rather effective film  
in this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film  
though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism ( such as the impressive battle scenes ) , his latest film does simply not engage  
i believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed  
it's obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe  
the characters feel designed , unreal , merely shadows , with no life outside the conflict  
even the actors can not save this film from going under  
though both jackson and jones act admirably , with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this , it is not something that these great actors can boast of  
they have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back  
jackson is gray and jones uninteresting  
the rest of the cast , including ben kingsly , blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks  
the time has come for the verdict  
on the charges of complete lack of objectivity , i find this film guilty  
on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking , i find it guilty "

if that were true , i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads : "" shay casey : seeing bad movies so you don't have to  "" 
but i know that's bunk-you're going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say  
so i have to tell the truth : every once in a while i get a nasty , masochistic urge to see a bad movie  
you know the feeling , when you're sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly  
sometimes i think that's why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies , ever  
admit it : sometimes you like seeing bad movies  
so do i  
so i saw "" supernova  "" 
truth be told , "" supernova "" wasn't quite as bad as i thought it might be  
maybe i just felt sorry for the actors , or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn't started tinkering with the director's ( walter hill ) final cut , causing him to want his name removed  
maybe i'm becoming a softy  
in any case , i didn't find "" supernova "" as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe  
but it's still bad  
the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel "" nightingale  "" 
the crew includes captain a  j  
marley ( robert forster ) , his new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) and danika lund ( robin tunney ) , and computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz )  
there are some attempts at "" characterization , "" but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female )  
don't expect any more explanation , because you won't get it  
anyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent  
during the dimension jump ( i think that's what it's called , but don't hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board  
he calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with  
then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening  
have you seen "" alien ? "" 
have you seen "" event horizon "" ( a lame movie in its own right ) ? 
good  
then you've seen "" supernova  "" 
post-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either  
after all , no one's going to think for a second that troy won't turn out to be a villain  
but the bigger problem with "" supernova "" is that it can' t just stick to the simple plot it's afforded  
numerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it's a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped  
was there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ? 
did the ship's computer learn something about humanity ? 
what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ? 
and just what does the film's title signify , if anything ? 
as far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn't developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements  
character relationships in this film also make very little sense  
for some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex  
we get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes  
bassett and spader's characters start off hating each other  
fifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they're engaging in some hanky-panky  
when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him  
every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut  
the most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits ! 
furthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits  
maybe that's why the film's title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster  
right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you're seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations  
the rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b  point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby  
point b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing  
doesn't make sense  
since i didn't understand anything about these characters' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ? 
not a whit  
it's a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do  
they don't find it  
bassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces  
sexual tension ? 
more like constipation  
maybe they're just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as "" this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice "

-1,"i think that saying that the x-files is one of this summer's most anticipated films is safe  
for five years , "" the x-files "" television show has developed a dedicated fan culture , whose rabid devotion to the series rivals that of "" star trek "" fans  
the premise of both the movie and the television series is two fbi agents who investigate the paranormal ; fox mulder ( david duchovny ) is the avid believer whose quest to find the truth about extraterrestrial life borders on the paranoid , and dana scully ( gillian anderson ) is the scientific skeptic trying to find a rational explanation to mulder's flights of fancy  
outlining the plot of the x-files movie is virtually impossible , since to be general would result in confusion , yet to be specific would give too much away  
nevertheless , i will try  
 "" the black ooze , "" and extraterrestrial , virus-like substance is threatening earth  
a "" shadow government "" is aware of this , but tries to cover-up the alien existence  
mulder and scully know "" the truth is out there , "" and so try to expose both the invasion and the cover-up  
there are three central questions i have heard asked about this movie : 1  
will those who don't watch the series be able to understand the movie ? 
yes  
isolated as an individual text , the x-files can stand alone  
they have given enough background for anyone , familiar with the show or not , to understand the movie  
although some of the secondary characters' histories may confuse the uninitiated , those characters are not essential to the film  
this is a major problem : they trot out token secondary characters from the series out for an appearance and then disappear just as quickly  
why bring superintendent skinner into the picture in the first place , and then have him sat silently on an fbi internal affairs committee ? 
why bring in "" the lone gunmen , "" three computer geek conspiracy theorists , for an even briefer appearance ? 
these characters are recurrent on the series , and their appearance in the film was met with whoops from the audience ( suggesting their popularity among fans - actually most of the audience could pass for "" the lone gunmen "" )  
still , then they vanish just as quickly  
2  the television show never gives us any answers  
will the movie actually explain some things ? 
yes  
in the x-files we get a fairly complete history of "" the black ooze , "" what it is and what it wants  
we finally get some understanding of the motivations behind the "" shadow government  "" 
there are even some subtle tie-ins with contemporary ufo-ology , including the "" greys "" and the roswell crash of 1947  
3  is the movie any good ? 
no  the x-files is a dreadful movie and shows some fundamental problems with writer/creator chris carter's talents and the relationship between cinema and television  
first off , the screenplay by series creator chris carter is sloppy and cliched  
after approximately forty-five minutes ( the length of a television episode minus the commercials ) , the pace drops to a snail's crawl  
not long after that point , when carter attempts to answer some questions we have had about the series , we wish he had not  
the explanations are so trite and ridiculous that one would have preferred it had carter not explained quite so much  
i am willing to suspend my disbelief a fair bit , but the absurdity carter wants me to swallow was just too much  
breaking the suspension of disbelief destroys the movie - and listening to other fans leave the cinema , maybe the series too  
the explanations are not only absurd , they are tired and unoriginal  
the extraterrestrials breed and gestate like those from the alien series , and their craft looks like a leftover set piece from independence day  
note that the alien movies , id4 , and the x-files are all from 20thcentury fox - a studio that is beginning to cannibalize itself i think  
the x-files is noteworthy for being the only movie based on a television series to be produced while the series was still running  
in comparing the movie and television series certain aspects of the respective media emerge  
the avoidance of the series to answer the questions it raised annoyed and frustrated many people  
however , i rather liked that about the series  
television allows you to impose as much , or as little , meaning on a show as you want  
it is the proverbial "" blank screen "" which we project our minds on  
meaning on television is open and ambiguous ; it is the nature of the medium  
cinema , on the other hand , is the opposite  
it projects onto us the filmmakers mind  
we can , in some films , fill the textual gaps ourselves , but that almost never happens in an american film  
meaning , in cinema , needs to be self-contained and determined  
so , when the x-files made that jump from small to big screen , carter needed to take into consideration the differences in the medium as well  
he did not  
by making explicit , what the television show left implicit , carter reveals the limits of his creativity and skill  
when they say that "" fans "" make a tv show , it is not far from the truth  
on television , fan culture must impose its meanings on the text because there is nothing there  
how true that is when we see the "" explicit "" x-files - there is nothing there "

director : george lucas cast : liam neeson , ewan mcgregor , natalie portman , jake lloyd , ian mcdiarmid , samuel l  jackson , oliver ford davies , terence stamp , pernilla august , frank oz , ahmed best , kenny baker , anthony daniels screenplay : george lucas producers : rick mccallum runtime : 131 min  
us distribution : 20th century fox rated pg : mild violence , thematic elements 
copyright 1999 nathaniel r  atcheson 
a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review  
i've attempted to obey this rule in recent months , but to do so would be impossible in this case  
the fact is , nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them  
the original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people  
for me , they calibrated my creativity as a child ; they are masterful , original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time ( and they still hold up pretty darn well )  
i am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release , but that doesn't make me any less dedicated to it  
on the contrary , the star wars trilogy -- and the empire strikes back in particular -- are three items on a very short list of why i love movies  
when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine-film series , i got exited  
when i first saw screenshots from the film , well over a year ago , i embarked on a year-long drool of anticipation  
and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving , i was ready to see the film  
but then there was the hype , the insane marketing campaign , and lucasfilm's secretive snobbery over the picture  
in the last weeks before the picture opened , while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater , i was tired of hearing about it  
i was tired of seeing cardboard cut-outs of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell  
i just wanted to see the movie  
reader , do not misunderstand  
i did not have an anti-hype reaction  
the hype was unavoidable  
i understand and accept the hype -- it's just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released  
five minutes into the phantom menace , i knew there was a problem  
 "" who are these jedi knights ? "" 
i asked  
 "" why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine-gun rapidity ? "" 
 "" why aren't these characters being developed before their adventures ? "" 
 "" why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film ? "" 
these were just some of my questions early on  
later , i asked , "" where's the magic of the first three films ? "" 
and "" why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes ? ' 
by the end of the film , i was tired , maddened , and depressed  
george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless , mindless , summer blockbuster  
the phantom menace is no star wars film  
take away the title and the jedi talk and the force , and you're left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time  
it's an embarrassment  
i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored , or a new theme is examined , or a special effects shot isn't used  
there are a few of each , but they're all token attempts  
the fact is , george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects  
this is not what i wanted to see  
i didn't want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth , but i did  
the story centers mostly around qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson , looking lost and confused ) and his apprentice , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor , who scarcely has a line in the film ) and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo  
naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation ; their contact on naboo is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people  
after picking up jar jar binks ( a completely cgi character , voiced by ahmed best ) , they head to tatooine , where they meet young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his mother ( pernilla august )  
qui-gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin , and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys  
the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious , neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters  
there isn't anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form  
the way lucas has handled it , however , it unsatisfactory  
first of all , we don't learn one single thing about qui-gon jinn  
not one thing  
what was his life like before this film ? 
well , i imagine he didn't have one  
that's why he feels like a plot device  
this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role , and why he's recently retired from film ( i don't blame him , honestly )  
obi-wan , a character i was really looking forward to learning more about , is even less interesting  
mcgregor has just a few lines , so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere  
since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace , lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie  
things start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine ; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed-out character in the film , and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role  
i was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene ; rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting "

 ( even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi  ) 
the makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago  
this really isn't a good movie  
have you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation ? 
well , any hope a viewer may have had , perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill , will be dashed by the time he's seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn  
they're awful  
these commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer , some weird crap about a dead indian , teens , and wolves , and an "" action "" movie called detonator starring scott baio  
scott baio ! 
what idiot dreamed this movie up ? 
after surviving these abysmal trailers , the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented : watchers reborn  
 "" maybe it won't be * that * bad "" he may say to himself  
 "" perhaps , just perhaps , the bottom-of-the-barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading  
watchers reborn , after all , is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago  
it stars mark hamill -- luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy  
lou rawls is even in the mix ! "" 
unfortunately , the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill ( he looks very sick here ) , and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers , the book  
the latter is really too bad  
koontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good , but he is still my favorite hack writer  
koontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful  
people who read many of his books , however , often complain of repetitive plot devices  
it's definately not a koontz book if there isn't ( 1 ) a psychic , ( 2 ) a super-intelligent dog , or ( 3 ) a psychotic killer who likes ripping out people's eyeballs  
watchers has all three devices , which may explain why it's arguably the most popular of koontz's books  
the idea behind koontz's novel , though highly implausible , is very interesting  
basically , a biological war machine is created : a smart dog can be released in battle , track down its target , and then relay the target's position , psychically , to a large creature designed to kill in hand-to-hand combat  
silly but kind of neat too  
i'm sorry  
i don't mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn , the movie  
i suppose i just don't want to talk about the movie itself  
this turkey is really cheesy  
no one in this movie can act , including mark hamill , and it's difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero  
the cheese factor is only increased when he's involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist / geneticist / zoologist / whatever-the-f * * k-she's-supposed-to-be whom he befriends  
mercifully , the filmmakers opted not to do nudity  
to be honest , the only half-convincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein  
you know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts  
i find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie  
and the creature ! 
yes , the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling  
this creature is shot about 500 , 000 times , but it's okay  
the creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing  
oh , he can also rip body parts off , allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around  
cheesy gore  
that's another main element of watchers reborn  
it has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the film's campiness rather than its suspense  
ultimately , i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror / sci-fi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the film's silliness ( though this film will tax even their patience -- it's an 83 minute film , but it feels like four hours )  
also , i hate to admit , i have survived far worse than this  
anyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin : fear the rush will know what i mean  
finally , i couldn't help but think that watchers reborn would work well as "" bot fodder "" for the creative folks behind one of my all-time favorite shows , "" mystery science theater 3000  "" 
this thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with a smile on my face  
rated r , watchers reborn contains dozens of blood-spattered bodies and unconvincing gore  
it also has violence , obviously  
i wouldn't recommend it for the little kids , but i'm sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay "
-1,"years ago , robin williams made _jumanji_ , a brilliant achievement in special effects , but a travesty on nearly every other level  
the same can be said for _what dreams may come_ , a boring , illogical , weepie-wannabe that left my senses numb  
don't get me wrong : i love breathtaking special effects and pulse-pounding imagery  
_brazil_ is on my personal top ten  
_the city of lost children_ is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios  
i even love _2001_ and _last year at marienbad_ , being in the minority amidst my friends  
_what dreams may come_ , imagery aside , has little daring thought to complement its imagery  
the daring thought it _does_ have is never fully realized  
it's idea of a plot is so lukewarm , that it insults the bigger questions it raises  
it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences , put on an electronica soundtrack , and sell it as one of those popular _mind's eye_ videos  
robin williams plays chris nielsen , who dies too prematurely--not only in the story , but before we have a chance to really know and care for him  
the director , vincent ward , and the screenwriter ronald bass , have chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience with the afterlife  
big mistake  
it would have been far better to take the half-hour or so needed to tell his life story first ( ala _it's a wonderful life_ ) , so that i can build up respect for him , so i could know and possibly care for him , his children , and his long-suffering wife ( played superbly by annabella sciorra )  
instead , the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story , expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses  
it doesn't  
so in the afterlife , chris learns that ( a ) people still don't meet god , ( b ) that our thoughts are reality , and ( c ) time does not exist there  
hmm    
i+ll grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative  
 ( the "" not meeting god "" part still irks at me , but perhaps there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect )  
that said , this alternate reality still makes no possible sense  
read on    
chris' wife commits suicide  
since suicides go to hell , chris would be separated from his wife forever  
the important question is , is heaven really heaven if you are separated from the one you love ? 
good question  
and i like good thought-provoking questions  
i don+t like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question  
i _loathe_ it when the filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes a popular rescue film , especially a rescue film which does not take its underlying premise seriously  
i _really_ loathe it when it+s story is no longer run by logic , but by special effects  
hey chris : did you forget ? 
your thoughts are _real_  
they are more _real_ than the physical world , according to the new-age screenplay  
so , why don+t you conjure up positive thoughts of annie , and let that run wild ? 
and then she would appear before you , and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity ? 
because there would be no movie , that+s why  
and albert the angel ( played by miscast cuba gooding , jr  ) says bluntly : "" that+s fantasy  "" 
umm    
if your thoughts are more real than the physical , then fantasy is not fantasy , but real  
surely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that  
and if you happen to think that you are an unimaginative person , and that your thoughts aren't big enough to sustain you for eternity , well , in all due respect , that's why i don't subscribe to this theology  
all due respect  
another idea , based on "" time , ( pause ) , does not exist here ! "" 
so chris , spend your eternity with annie , as she is on earth , reliving your favorite memories , or hang out with her when she was growing up  
you+ve got eternity : perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not to freak her out  
and forcing her to write "" i still exist "" in her diary , imo , is just too tacky  
there are many other ideas , all of which are a hundred times better than what+s unraveled in the plot  
the great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before , and just come out stale  
most insulting is the subplot where important people in chris+ life appear in heaven differently than he expects , so when they finally show themselves , he realizes they were with him all along "

-1,"i've never written a review for a movie i haven't watched all the way through , but i had to make an exception with powder  
i was about forty-five minutes into this one at a friend's house when he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house  
so i never got to finish the movie and i'm sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of a bad movie  
but i can at least get a partial review out of it , because i saw enough to know this one wasn't worth finishing in the first place  
the movie centers around a freaky teenager who's spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents' house  
when grandpa dies ( taking his department store down with him ) , social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder ( first and middle names ? 
gold bond ) to a state home , where we find out he's a different from the other kids  
actually , we find out he's different when we first see him , because he's the most pale individual we've ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever  
when powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie , the father takes one look at him and says "" he's not my son  "" 
obviously  
all i want to know is where the pillsbury dough boy was nine months ago  
so the white-faced freak leaves his neverland ranch for the state home and faces the ridicule of other kids  
that is , until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him "" wear "" his spoon ( "" you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass  "" 
decisions , decisions    ) and he uses telepathic powers to draw all the silverware in the room into a giant pile in the middle of the table  
so if his father is the pillsbury dough boy , his mother must be sissy spacek's carrie character  
and you have to factor in two more things from the subsequent scenes , as we find out powder has some sort of super-intelligence ( "" your i  q  
test went straight off the chart ! "" ) 
and attracts electrical power  
this first shows up as powder visits the world of high school ( if he's such a genius already , why would he need a high school education ? ) and sits through a demonstration in jeff goldblum's science class  
goldblum plugs in a "" jacob's ladder "" device that shows current running up two wires and immediately the current flows across the room and into powder's chest  
but goldblum just stands there for about thirty seconds watching , instead of just unplugging the damn thing  
i guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in a row ( following hideaway and nine months )  
that's about all i saw before the big fight began and , let me tell you , that was twice as interesting as the movie itself  
but like i said , i saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization  
none of these movies ever handle the subject properly , instead introducing the feeble beauty and the beast copout of having a beautiful woman fall in love with the guy's personality , overlooking his personal appearance  
i already had the female character picked out ( the girl who was sitting next to him in the back of the room during the electrocution scene ) , but i guess i'll never know for sure what happened

-1,"martial arts master steven seagal ( not to mention director ! ) has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights , talks in a hushed tone , and squints at any sign of danger  
he's also the most consistent individual in hollywood today , since all his movies suck  
they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art ( that is , martial art )  
i'm sure the guy's good , and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows , although a tad haughty , but these movies he makes are all the same : a guy who is basically indestructable , is maybe wounded supposedly mortally , then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses ( although i kinda liked "" under siege "" )  
of course , this one , as a change , has a "" message "" that is drilled into our mind    of 
course , after he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people  
so why do i watch his crap ? 
i usually don't  
i will never , and you can hold me to this , i will never pay to see this man's movies , unless , and only unless , he's in a supporting role ( i  e  
 "" executive decision "" ) and i'd definitely pay if he dies ( i  e  
 "" executive decision "" )  
but this one has a special place in my heart  
this doesn't mean it's good or that i even liked it  
this was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle , and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la "" mystery science theatre 3000 , "" and this was a couple years before i had heard of "" mystery science theatre 3000  "" 
in this one , seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased-up typical shallow villain , this time played by an oscar-winner to give the movie some more clout - michael caine  
it seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land  
around the 20-30 minute point , seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs ( what with his new "" fire down below , "" another "" message film "" ) , and caine has him bumped off    or 
does he ? 
seagal is rescued by some inuits , and falls in love with one of them , played by joan chen , who can act , hypothetically , but , for some reason , not here  
one of caine's cliched henchmen ( played here with a lot of overacting by john c  mcginley ) shoots the cheif of the inuit clan , and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory    literally , 
of course  
at one point , seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn't have any options but blow stuff up  
he even goes as far as to say , "" i don't want to kill someone , "" and in the same breath , he asks some guy where the arsenal is  
i have no problem with violence  
i'm a huge john woo fan , but he paints his films with suspense , skill , style , depth , characterization , and just plain cool violence  
in the films of seagal , the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly , and him either wounding or killing them  
at some points , they use the cliche of the talking villain , where the villain has the advantage , can shoot seagal , but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan , or saying a corny line , to which seagal says something hokey back , and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them , and does  
this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn't take itself seriously at all , like in the case of this summer's "" con air  "" 
but seagal is serious about his skill , and of course , his message  
i wouldn't mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence  
but seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle , not pounded into the viewer's mind  
the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish , thus we can't take him and his motives seriously , and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment , he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig , and kills some workers who were just doing his job  
then at the end , he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech , just in case you didn't get the message from the trailers  
what seagal doesn't realize is that no one takes his films seriously ( although maybe a couple do ) and any message he has is no only redundant , but doesn't comfortably fit in his film , which is filled to the brim with hokey violence , crap suspense , stupid melodrama , and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish  
as far as seagal and his acting , he's rather boring  
he squints , he kills  
period  
nothing else  
oh , yeah , there's corny one-liners ( "" i'm gonna reach out and touch someone ! "" )  
of course , he's the star , and we're supposed to root for him and all , so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerks  
michael caine , who's a great actor , is just supposed to yell and look cold  
he does it well , i guess , but this is no "" alfie  "" 
of coure , no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him  
his big henchman , john c "

-1,"hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell  
the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films  
in a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous  
with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong's best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u  s  productions  
such talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results  
now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai  
unfortunately "" romeo must die "" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong's rhythms  
the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking  
enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong )  
kai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai's boss and leader of the local chinese family  
a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down  
it's not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends  
the following morning po sing is found dead  
suspicions escalate , as issac o'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder  
his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture  
issac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter  
the scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder  
he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined  
hung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work  
escaping to the u  s  han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother's death  
 "" romeo must die "" is in many ways a fun film  
it is both absurd and assured  
the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes "" the godfather ""  
the relationship between jet li's han and aaliyah's trish o'day reminds us of abel ferrera's "" china girl "" , except that romeo must die's couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another  
their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history  
the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable  
li , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination  
allayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace  
it's obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic  
but , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it  
delro lindo as issac o'day carries himself well in the film  
an unsung and under appreciated actor , mr  lindo turns out the films best performance  
the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d  b  woodside as issac's son , colin  
the performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in  
an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written  
first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film  
having a career as one of the industry's best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and "" romeo must die "" does look good  
but the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes  
the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in  
the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing  
and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah's bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever  
the best things about the film are its fight scenes  
jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles  
one needs only to see his film "" fist of legend "" to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat "
-1,"a hotshot lawyer gets an obviously guilty child molester acquitted , and shortly after during the victory celebration gets offered an opportunity to show his prowess in new york city  
the lawyer , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is not offered a job yet , he is asked to simply pick a jury  
he accepts  
the jury he selects work out well and before long he is offered a job with the firm  
making his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money , but a gorgeous apartment  
he convinces his wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) to make the move to new york  
the first case given to him is a big test ; a "" winless "" case concerning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement  
the charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal  
his new boss and partner in the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing , explaining many of his philosophies on law , women and sex , and angles the promise of a blissful , wealthy life  
kevin's next case is a dream case , given to him by milton himself ( much to the chagrin to his colleagues ) , defending a triple murder suspect who has had a history of problems with the law  
although kevin's career is taking off , his home life is not doing very well  
mary ann is starting to have numerous problems  
she is experiencing severe depression over kevin's long hours , and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls , their faces becoming horribly disfigured  
kevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife  
he does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with , then focus all of his attention on his wife  
not helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer ( connie nielson ) also working with the firm  
mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home  
kevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife , and gets disturbing news from his mother ( judith ivey ) about the mystery concerning the identity of his father  
he also starts to lose control of his case  
kevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man  
that man is his boss , mr  milton , a truly evil character who just may be the devil himself  
kevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store  
but how do you defeat the devil ? 
why is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd ? 
do filmmakers really believe that "" normal "" courtroom drama doesn't fit the bill and they have to juice them up ? 
the courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in a real courtroom , which wouldn't have been too bad if it weren't keanu reeves trying to pull it off  
i give reeves credit for trying hard , but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character , just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short  
charlize theron defines the term "" over-the-top "" in her performance as mary ann lomax , a disappointment in contrast to her good performance in "" 2 days in the valley ""  
the only good performance in the movie is by al pacino , but i kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess ? 
maybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil , and you can tell he is having fun doing so , but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him  
it's pretty standard stuff , including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom  
please read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled , but i have to get something off of my chest  
in 1986 i remember watching a movie called "" wisdom "" with emilio estevez and demi moore , and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do  
what i like to call "" guess what , it was all a dream "" scenario  
in "" wisdom "" the two lead characters are killed at the end , only to have one of the characters "" wake up "" from an apparent and say "" gosh , i'm glad that didn't really happen ! ""  
i considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with  
well , the same thing happens in "" the devils advocate "" , and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream ( perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan , since it failed and he is the devil ) , but the point is that the last 90% of the film didn't happen  
i know it's a stretch , after all it is a movie and nothing really happened , but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that  
of course , the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one  
as i recall , "" wisdom "" was a decent film  
 "" the devil's advocate "" is not  
the devils advocate

-1,"best remembered for his understated performance as dr  hannibal lecter in michael mann's forensics thriller , manhunter , scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on  
usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he's only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do  
if you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach's hidden agenda  
cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l  i  e  , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge  
big john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad  
what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light  
he's an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids' problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives  ) 
he'll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world  
l  i  e  stands for long island expressway , which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia  
filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano )  
in his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l  i  e  
highway deaths of filmmaker alan j  pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52  
he's both fascinated and disturbed by the l  i  e  , and those feelings are projected onto big john ( who follows howie around in his bright red car , but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn't want to do  
this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he's a beast , but ashamed of it  ) 
l  i  e  would have worked best as a half-hour short film about howie's ill-advised foray into big john's haven  
there is unnecessary padding with howie's miserable dad ( bruce altman ) in the hot seat for a white-collar crime , degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle-class houses , and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise-ass gary terrio ( billy kay ) , a handsome artful dodger  
rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) , these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length  
concurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted  
cox , sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo , is all bluff and bluster  
dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent  
we're so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious ( calling haley joel ! ) , it's surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene  
the restraint is admirable  
but l  i  e  's screenplay doesn't always give them the best material  
when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious  
director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john , who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach's goldberg variations  
it's too much  
there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john's other boy toy ( walter masterson ) , jealous over the newbie  
this plot thread predictably leads to violence  
not content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff's superb ghost world ) , cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note  
it's typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet , sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note  
in this regard , l  i "

 "" it's just    
the way    
we are  "" 
--- a rapist ( matt frewer ) responds to supergirl's ( helen slater ) query as to why she's being attacked , an example of the mind-numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl  
i'll admit it    
i love superman iii  
i know it's hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor , but i still think it's a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise  
supergirl , a spin-off film of sorts from the series' same producers ( alexander and ilya salkind ) , doesn't even rival superman iii in terms of quality , let alone superman or superman ii  
supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time  
as the film begins we see the residents of argo city , a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in "" inner space "" , go about their daily lives  
ok    
what ? 
so these are exiles from krypton , which blew up right ? 
were they living there before krypton exploded ? 
how do you get to "" inner space "" ? 
this whole "" inner space "" notion is never explained , particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world  
how do they know where superman went ? 
how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ? 
these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me  
argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron  
one day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o' toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman's cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art  
kara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of "" whatever "" that protects the city  
in the chaos , the omegahedron sails out through the opening , dooming the argonians to death    
in three days time , or something  
kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world  
the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who , immediately before her dip was ruined , announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook )  
selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination  
selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she's arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume )  
supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives  
ok    
huh ? 
why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ? 
attention movie : explain yourself ! 
i'm sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much  
i can't buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to  
knowing that she needs a secret identity , supergirl basically "" wills "" herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle ) , picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school  
she's given her dorm assignment , and who happens to be her roommate ? 
lois lane's sister , lucy  
ok , coincidence is one thing folks , but we're getting really contrived now  
what follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks    
complete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason , of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! )  
best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks  
at this point i'm rapidly wondering why i'm bothering with this nonsense  
there is some credit to give to the film however  
one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an "" evil "" bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its "" prey "" is very well done  
also , its commendable to see genders reversed in the film , whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools  
hart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara's love interest , a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film's more ridiculous moments , when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some "" menacing "" bumper cars ) "

bad  
that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls  
if that summary isn't enough for you , how about t&a , t&a , t&a ? 
still haven't got the point ? 
other than director russ meyer's predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore-mentioned anatomical areas , there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie  
that is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay  
after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face  
this movie stinks out loud  
quite frankly , this movie deserves a  
but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny  
so i'm giving it a  
and maybe that is too generous  
right from the opening credits , i knew that i had a class-a bomb on my hands  
not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting , but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform  
i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene  
to be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film  
with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it wouldn't have surprised me if the opening had never been explained  
so what is this movie about ? 
you ask  
like it really matters  
ok , here goes  
this all-girl band headed by kelly macnamara ( dolly reed ) and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry  
once there , they do manage to find success ( due as much to their hooters as anything else ? it sure wasn't for their brutally bad singing voices ) , and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them  
everything from big egos , to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral  
there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure , but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing  
>from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here  
other than the above-mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have  
the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts  
mr  ebert has generously thrown in helpings of "" hey man "" , "" dig "" and my all time favorite -- "" this is my happening , and it freaks me out ""  
now i ask you , with lines like that how can you go wrong ? 
ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue  
maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter  
i don't know , but all the big words in the world wouldn't be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting  
but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie  
i've seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey  
in fact , there is one scene -- the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes -- during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries  
add to the directing and writing the music in this movie  
i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken , there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers  
then we have the cast  
first lets start david gurian who played harris , the manager of the band  
this has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera  
sadly , his acting doesn't come close to making up for his looks  
if you have been following along up to this point , this shouldn't surprise you  
meyer's stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets  
dolly reed plays kelly , the leader of the band  
and no surprise here , she was cast for her cup size , not her talents  
and yes , she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents  
sadly , her ass is almost as large as her chest  
hey , it a sexist movie , so i'm writing a sexist review  
then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey , one of the other band members  
this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie  
meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all , but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all "

-1,"the previews for the movie are pretty good  
they show a little plot , all the characters , and the emotional highlights , all spliced together to give a general impression of the script  
unfortunately , the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes  
the residents of mystery love hockey  
mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football  
the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player who's guilty of shooting another man ( yes , that's one of the movie's jokes  ) 
every saturday , the best players pair off for a game , and the whole town comes to watch  
the town's prodigal son charlie ( hank azaria ) wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated  
mystery's national fame has the town abuzz  
a week later , charlie actually shows up in person , and he brings with him an offer from the nhl  
the new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals  
the mysterians see this as both good and bad  
on the one hand , they'd love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition  
on the other hand , they don't want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes  
the movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition  
biebe ( russell crowe ) has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys , including his new replacement  
he's already resentful , and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife  
crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film , so he's just kind of stuck with constantly brooding  
charlie , meanwhile , is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a man's worth  
his "" gift "" of the feature story , and of the new york rangers , was his way of compensating for not being a better skater  
he hoped it would earn him some respect and merit , but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him  
burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter , the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans  
walter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey , but he actively tries to put it behind him  
he wants his son to take the game more seriously , but he wants his community to just get over it  
reynolds could have been good , but sloppy writing and/or editing keep walter in the corner , and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together  
one character actually was interesting  
biebe's wife ( mary mccormack ) , like the judge , understood that there was more to life than hockey  
but unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community  
she chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open  
her unique insight is verbalized once , and it lasts only a scene before it is gone , but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom  
mysterty , alaska follows a handful of other characters , but none are well developed or worth mentioning  
the biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story , no underlying thing that the movie is really about  
instead , roach and screenwriters david e  kelley and sean o'byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy  
they try to make you laugh and cry , to feel outrage and pride  
they present the framing and cadence for jokes , but there's nothing truly funny  
they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness , but they give you nothing to be really sad about  
as columnist molly ivins would say , it's all hat , no cattle  
the perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about  
there is a funeral scene , played with appropriate gravity and somber music  
it is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide what's truly important  
russell crowe steps forward to speak , about to spell out the movie's metaphor for us  
he says that what really matters in life is "" community     "" 
then adds "" and hockey  "" 
i guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear  
only mildly bad , mystery , alaska probably deserves 2 stars  
i even laughed out loud , genuine laughs in places  
but i docked it an extra half star when mike myers , a friend of roach , turned up in a role that didn't suit him "

but what did you expect when you clicked on this title ? 
 * * * 
cast : kristen holly smith , danica sheridan , alex boling , michael dotson , sonya hensley , janet krajeski , sabrina lu , dionysius burbano , calvin grant , jeff b  harmon written and directed by : jeff b  harmon running time : 97 minutes 
 "" the thought of losing you makes me all vomity inside  "" 
--- blatz balinski ( danica sheridan ) laments the fact that her lesbian lover , april ( kristen holly smith ) , has just received a telegram from her ex-fiance  
isle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot ( smith ) , a resident of the small town of bumfuck , arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson ( michael dotson )  
when april gets extreme cold feet she runs home , sticks a gun in her mouth , and pulls the trigger  
instead of killing herself , she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos , an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed ( except for lance , the homosexual toilet cleaner/slave )  
april loves her new home and friends , but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up  
mr  and ms  pfferpot ( director jeff b  harmon and janet krajeski ) decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr  sigmoid colon ( also jeff b  harmon ) , who claims he can cure homosexuality  
in actuality , dr  colon is homosexual as well and begins his special "" treatment "" on dick dickson ( unbeknownst to dick )  
when april turns down dick's demand for her to return to bumfuck , he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambo-style  
instead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance ( alex boling ) and the two of them , along with april and her lover blatz , get married  
 ( note to the filmmaker : why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i'm assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided ? ) 
april's parents , feeling like there is no recourse , call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer ) their way  
the bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the "" circuitry "" and they re-wire it and send it back to washington d  c  , destroying it  
mr  and ms  pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own  
i'm not sure if writer/director/co-star jeff b  harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs  
either way , he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie  
the film opens with a preacher running a small african-american child out of town , and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan ( during a jaunty musical number ) , preceded by remarks about "" gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others , such as the jews ""  
if harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be , then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film , but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can't help but feel like he had some serious intent  
as for the entire central theme of the movie , i'm afraid that it's one that i just don't get  
i tried to keep an open mind while watching it , but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes  
it was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society  
how does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non-acceptance ? 
i'm not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society , but don't force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren't going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me  
again , maybe i'm missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make , but if so , i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully  
as far as musical comedies go , isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical , but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy  
despite the disturbing visuals , "" mom and apple pie "" stuck with me for the rest of the day  
speaking of disturbing visuals , "" wedding bells ain't ringing "" could have been a decent song , but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying  
 "" i'm a lesbian "" ( which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular ) is also pretty good , but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms  smith  
it's mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based  
the other performers are decent , save for the rosie o'donnell like performance given by danica sheridan  
i have no inherent problem with her character ; it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired  
one particular musical number , "" lesbian rock "" , was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film-going life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan  
the film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll  
the remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs ( "" lesbian rock "" included ) and the ridiculously presented anti-nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film  
once the "" isle of lesbos reprise "" was reached , i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all  
why was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end ? 
isle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www "
-1,"battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000 , and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close  
in fact , i'll be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years  
based on the novel by scientology guru l  ron hubbard , battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information  
it's the year 3000 , and an alien race called the psychlos ( which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers ) conquered our planet in nine minutes  
ok , we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind  
when were we conquered ? 
the audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 , 000 years earlier , and if that is the case then we're going to get into a whole bunch of problems later ( trust me    
keep reading )  
also , why don't we get to see earth get conquered ? 
how the hell do you make a popcorn sci-fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film ? 
humans now live as cavemen or slave labor , and for the film's first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver , colorado  
they grunt and groan and babble about monsters  
so , when the psychlos conquered earth , were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills ? 
none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered ( whenever that was )  
this is definitely not the way to start an action/sci-fi film  
one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster , and he begins to fight it  
the "" monster "" turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course  
he turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course , with some shrubs growing over them  
so , in 1 , 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time , with only a few weeds growing over it ? 
anyway , some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl ( john travolta ) a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit  
the cavemen ( led by barry pepper ) are forced to do their bidding or whatever , but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet , or something  
so these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1 , 000 years earlier ? 
and , we're supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who can't even handle a few cavemen ? 
one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos  
so jets left unattended for 1 , 000 years are still able to fly ? 
please , if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood  
why did the psychlos leave jets around anyway ? 
shouldn't they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us ? 
the psychlos refer to humans as "" man animals "" but yet dogs are still "" dogs ""  
why aren't they "" dog animals "" ? 
the psychlos are after mining earth's precious resources , but for 1 , 000 years are unaware of fort knox ? 
why do i even care at this point ? 
i'm a fan of travolta's and i'm glad to see he's back on the a-list in hollywood ( despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon )  
but how did he possibly think this was a good movie ? 
and how did he think he was giving a good performance here ? 
he's more than capable of making a menacing villain ( see broken arrow and face/off ) but whenever his character came on screen i couldn't hold back my laughter  
now despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have , travolta just looks like travolta  
all of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face , but travolta just has a goatee  
also , travolta's acts with a sort of phony upper-class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world  
ooooo , scary villain  
as a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better  
you can make a dumb but good sci-fi film ( i love independence day for example ) , but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth  
i did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening    
i cleaned my glasses , walked around the theater , made a grocery list , chose my lottery numbers for the week , replayed super bowl xxv in my head ( with commercials )    
and still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids  
by the time we actually reach the year 3000 , people should still be avoiding this film  
folks , save your cash   
don't go see it , don't rent it , and don't buy it  
you'd be more entertained by taking the money you'd use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind , watching it sail away ( hell , send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal    
we'll entertain you plenty with that kind of money )  
unless of course you're just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running , which is just about all you'll come away with from this movie  
that , and a headache  
[editor's note : for some reason though , the day after my screening i converted to scientology  
i'm not sure why   "

-1,"in the continuation of warner brother's franchise , joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow  
what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film  
avika goldsman's screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another  
this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as "" the client "" is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke  
situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another  
this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone's batgirl , who just happens to be alfred's niece  
the story of dr  victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought  
while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife , dr  freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure , and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment  
now of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live  
now the logic of that little sub-plot escapes me  
if mr  freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death , why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth  
this is indeed a cold hearted man  
the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory  
she wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal  
she joins with mr  freeze in his plan to start a new ice age , destroying all animal life , therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them  
the characters have no logic  
batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films  
now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward / robin , bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure , constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships , while at the same time not really having any  
george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him  
to say that his performance is workman-like is to be generous  
his best performances are still on "" e  r  ""  
bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend ( played by elle macpherson ) , that it brings into question bruce's latent homosexuality  
there is no spark and no passion ( as there was for nicole kidman's psychologist in "" batman forever "" ) between bruce and anyone other than alfred  
and even that relationship is very reserved  
robin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series  
now he's just a spoiled kid  
in "" batman forever "" , burt ward wanted to be batman's partner and friend  
now , robin is suffering from ego deficiency  
robin's attraction for poison ivy is not believable , except for a boy around the age of 15  
his later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest , even though they are not related in a traditional sense  
chris o'donnell , once considered a rising star , successfully burns up on reentry with this performance  
his robin needs nothing more than a good spanking  
the less said about alicia silverstone's performance the better  
this talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film  
she was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it  
this brings us to the villains  
arnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday  
the most rediculous scene is during mr  freeze's imprisonment  
the guards are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film  
it's almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as a gang member  
umu thurman struts and coos her way through her part , showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status  
her poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in "" sextette "" ( 1978 )  
the only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough  
these two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film "

 "" please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie  "" 
-- chuck dowling , the jacksonville film journal 
i wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997's batman and robin  
apparently , no one heard my words  
oh , how i wish you had heard them  
oh how i wish someone had stopped him    
because he's done it again  
the plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore , a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale  
in fact , it was everything that 8mm is not  
in the opening minutes of 8mm , we see private detective tom welles ( nicolas cage ) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u  s  government  
keep this fact in mind , cage is trusted with an important case , which he solves  
he returns home to his wife and new daughter , and even finds time to rake his yard ( keep that in mind too , it's important as well )  
he's hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery  
after her husband's death she comes across a film in his private safe  
it appears to be snuff film , a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera  
the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film , hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film  
so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film  
the main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless  
welles is actually selected for the case by the old woman's lawyer ( anthony heald , an actor who always plays the same type of character , that being a bad guy )  
when you first see him , your first instinct is that he's behind the whole thing  
the choice of casting does the film in  
then , as welles begins his investigation , at times we will see a shadowy figure following him  
the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer ( or someone sent by the lawyer ) because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet  
so your first instinct has now been confirmed  
then , when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing , he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced ( in one of those ridiculous "" since we're going to kill you anyway , why not tell you the whole thing "" moments )  
but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he's told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended  
huh ? 
also , when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing , his main goal is to get the film back  
so why did he give it up in the first place ? ! 
the lawyer had the film the whole time , then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film ? ! 
it's totally absurd    
and this is the screenwriter of seven ? 
late in the film there's a confrontation between all the main characters , and after a struggle one of the character's guns ends up underneath a car  
cage , who has been handcuffed to a bed , is rapidly trying to get to his gun , which is on a table  
james gandolfini's character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of "" suspense ""  
you see , the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he's trying to reach it from , and so instead of going around the car to the other side ( where he can easily reach it ) he just keeps stretching  
go around to the other side of the car ! ! 
this goes on for minutes  
then , after cage gets his gun , gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car  
boy , schumacher is really really getting on my nerves  
i think the final straw would be when cage returns home , devastated by everything that he's seen on this case , and then is no longer able to rake his lawn ! 
we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard  
other things that bugged me about 8mm : one would be the music , if you can call it that  
whenever the score starts up , it sounds like techno music , and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it  
awful decision there joel  
another is cage's performance  
at this point he's capable of a wide range of performances , either good or bad  
for 8mm , he delivers a very wooden one , and only shines when he's interacting with joaquin phoenix ( who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case )  
you're capable of much better mr  cage  
now as for you mr  schumacher "

-1,"watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute 'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey  
if the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star  
alas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs  
what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars  
that's pretty generous , considering the movie's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek  
when will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it  
so why such a seemingly high rating ? 
there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage  
first , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater  
the sound and screen kicked ass  
nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way )  
also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie's tension  
i even liked the computer-generated settings  
i usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i've seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities  
also , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain  
william hurt isn't too bad either  
neither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable  
and perhaps i shouldn't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood  
there is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a "" real "" kiss -- no sex )  
it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six  
those movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven  
that type of moviemaking is a lost art  
now for the bad news  
worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue  
it's squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction  
 "" you better hold on to your joystick , "" is one such line  
and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign  
second worst , and closely related , is the screenplay  
the story's exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what's happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest  
once the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived  
when gary oldman easily reprograms will's pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : "" he flipped the switch to 'evil  ' "" 
then there's the tone of the movie  
the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson  
then it could be an adventure movie  
they're mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn't a good enough actor to carry it off  
still , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination  
just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn't mean that we have to bow to a "" promise keepers "" notion of who's the center of a family  
many quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect  
and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie  
in star wars , the rebels were the good guys  
we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system  
in lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free  
that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists  
finally , a few specific details deserve criticism  
the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056  
why ? 
why bother saying what year this is  
just tell us it's the future  
i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997  
setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won't be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway  )  
then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole  
this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny's barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven't learned a thing about ergonomics "

-1,"a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels  
first , there's the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie  
but occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery  
no no    
just kidding  
had you going there for a moment , didn't i ? 
in all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games  
the first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it's 5 billion inhabitants )  
the mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth  
unfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance  
the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game  
i'd even go so far as to say that many folks who didn't know about the game probably enjoyed the movie  
the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn't try to overachieve  
there were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot  
and , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office  
mortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie  
shao khan has decided that he's going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament  
thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid  
one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought "" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now  "" 
too bad they didn't simply stick with the formula from the first movie  
i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : 
 * the acting is truly bad  
sandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie )  
 * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i've * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder  
in the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics  
i generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim "" tiny "" lister , jr  being cast as the president of the u  s  in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite "" utility "" actors but he's so totally wrong for this part that he doesn't even have the luxury of amused self-awareness  
 * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again  
 * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva )  
for these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2    
    unless you're a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie  
in that case , the following critiques also apply : 
 * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter  
wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer  
hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene  
 * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more )  
sonya does her "" kiss of death , "" jax does his "" earthquake , "" liu kang does his "" animality , "" and so on  
a big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely  
 * there aren't as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between  
silly , silly folks  
and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match  
lame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it  
 * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their "" animalities  "" 
motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie  
for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 "

i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in '95 , but i wanted to re-write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics  
we need to be warned about some truly awful films , too  
this picture was so bad , it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below )  
the only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno  
so , it does indeed have some plusses    
in fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff  
and her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone  
this character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ? ) 
far too annoying far too often  
like in 1998s "" bulworth "" , when the movie was over i didn't care one little iota about the main character  
at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though  
 "" showgirls "" is too stupid to make a statement  
some people claim that the story is based on the legendary "" all about eve "" of all things ! 
if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l  mankiewicz was , he'd be    well , 
he'd be a good screenwriter  
instead , this project may have sunk his career  
he wrote the ( ha ha ! ) 
script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed  
the same team who created a good sex-film in 1992 ( "" basic instinct "" ) struck out here with their occasional violence , gratuitous x-rated sex scenes , and numerous ( and quite unnecessary ) lesbian overtones  
the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer  
after the supposed street-smart young "" lady "" gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack-jawed yokel in the opening sequence , she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the "" stardust hotel ""  
nomi doesn't take advantage of this contact to break into the big-time of dirty dancing right away  
first , she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club  
she sells her hot little wares at "" the cheetah "" for a short time , turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience  
hey , i never said she wasn't a hot number    
maybe it's that , her body , which gets her into the big-time when the star of the "" stardust hotel "" , crystal connors ( gina gershon ) stops into the strip club ( it certainly isn't her brains or pleasant disposition ! )  
crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend ( kyle maclachlan )  
he also happens to be the pleasure-seeking worm who runs the big show  
crystal gets nomi onto the "" stardust "" team and , after an interminable amount of time , nomi "" earns "" the role of crystal's understudy  
the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal  
it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she's "" not a whore ""  
that's a phrase we hear a few different times and it's completely ludicrous  
of course she is ! 
she sells her soul to make it big , but in the end we're supposed to believe that she's a better person than that  
we're supposed to root for her  
no way ! 
she's a tramp and a back-stabber who deserved nothing--least of all vindication in the    ahem    climax  
she is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is  
the sub-plot with a male dancer ( glenn plummer ) who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more  
it sure ain't character development ! 
plummer also appeared in "" speed "" in '94 in a smaller , yet better role  
this sub-plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control  
kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay-day or his standards have dipped since appearing in "" blue velvet "" "

this year's crop already seems inferior to that of past summers , even 1997's lackluster trio of batman & robin , the fifth element and the lost world  
the marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered on godzilla ( "" heeere , lee-zerd , lee-zerd    "" ) , which doesn't make me optimistic about future summers  
godzilla is , of course , based on a series of cult movies ( translation : really bad movies only a few people can tolerate ) from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turner-owned cable stations  
that this big-budget remake won't rise above its roots is fairly obvious  
the credits show us the origin of godzilla  
in five words : nuclear explosion creates giant lizard  
sounds like an enquirer headline , doesn't it ? 
the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable "" discovery "" sequence  
this time , a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling ( if that ain't a stereotype    ) 
when he discovers the telltale radar blip  
people die  
cut to our protagonist , played by matthew broderick  
he makes his first appearance wearing headphones , warbling along to "" singin' in the rain  "" 
it's a none-too-subtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie  
no dice , bueller  
from the beginning , poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzilla's enormous footprint  
every disaster movie has to have a know-it-all scientist , and this time broderick is it  
as the world's leading expert on radiated earthworms ( and wouldn't you love to have that printed on your business card ? ) , 
broderick is invaluable to the government  
he immediately dispels vicki lewis' theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because , hey , you can't take seriously the intellectual arguments of "" newsradio "" cast members  
broderick instead hits the nail on the head , announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard  
 "" the radiation isn't an anamoly , "" he announces , and lightning strikes  
 "" i believe this is a mutated abberation , "" he continues , and lightning strikes again  
it's vocabulary lightning , you see , activated by words of four syllables or more  
meanwhile , we're introduced to our new york cast , headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist ( maria patillo ) , broderick's former love  
gee , what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time ? 
poor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer  
italian cameraman hank azaria tells her she's not ruthless enough : "" nice doesn't get you anywhere in this town  
it's dog eat dog  "" 
actually , it's lizard eat city , as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apple's core  
the filmmakers provide us with a one-note drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla  
 "" i think i've got a bite , "" he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him  
you can guess what happens next  
similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city  
hearing the rumble of approaching footsteps , one new yorker remarks , "" please don't tell me that's another parade  "" 
please don't tell me that's the best line you could come up with  
mayor ebert is not pleased  
played by the principal from "" head of the class , "" he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option , and bickers with his assistant gene  
i guess the filmmakers knew they'd be getting two thumbs down from the critics and didn't even bother to kiss ass  
the problem is , if you're going to attack siskel and ebert , you should at least make it funny  
dialogue like , "" didn't we agree that we weren't going to have any sweets until after the election ? "" 
followed by , "" back off , gene , "" just doesn't work for me  
other lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick character's last name and frenchman jean reno's inability to find a good cup of coffee in new york  
there's even more fun to be had as godzilla progresses  
as the beast heads back into hiding , broderick suggests the military lure it out with food  
cue twelve dump trucks , all dropping fish into a new york intersection  
 ( broderick : that's a lot of fish  ) 
that ambush fails , but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying $50 worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood through them  
yep , godzilla's with children , which makes you wonder just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla "

-1,"sometimes , when i decide to write a short story or a poem , i think of a title first , and then think of a subject to go with it  
it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence  
i wouldn't be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits , and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it  
the title sequence is so good , so ominous and original , that it had me engrossed before the picture even began  
of course , my attention dwindled shortly into the film  
disturbing behavior , like so many thrillers , starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous  
it's a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex  
it's a suspense film with no suspense  
it's an evil small town story with no story to speak of  
it's a disaster , a listless and uninspired disaster , that just barely misses one-stardom because of a few good sequences , a mercifully short running time , and one terrific set of opening credits  
our main man is a fellow named steve clark , blandly played by jimmy marsden  
he moves to a small town with his family after , tragically , his brother shoots himself  
steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother ; we learn this through strange home-video like nightmares that he has occasionally  
the big trial for steve is , of course , to fit in at school and make new friends  
marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail , so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject  
as a social reject , he falls in with some pretentious dope-smoking philosophers , gavin ( nick stahl ) and rachel ( katie holmes )  
gavin informs steve that the local group of jocks , known as the blue ribboners , are actually a bunch of zombies , assimilating new members into their group , while sporadically killing innocent people  
so , it's up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1 ) solve the mystery , and 2 ) do something about it  
by the end of it all , something has happened and things have been explained , but the film still doesn't make any sense  
disturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg  
i've seen his name around recently ( he was one of the toucher-uppers on the armageddon script ) , and i imagine that , for the most part , he knows what he's doing when it comes to screenwriting  
he did , however , have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film , and then decided to actually take the time to write it out  
evil small town films are pretty common ( the last one , phantoms , is also a dismal failure ) , but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work  
rosenberg's script is a complete mess , lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization  
and it makes no sense , nor is their any purpose when things are finally "" explained  "" 
there is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks , but the film never explains exactly what * is * happening  
they get strapped to chairs , a microchip is inserted into their eyes , and -- poof -- they become sex-crazed , superviolent , machine-like creatures  
the doctor responsible for all this , dr  caldicott ( bruce greenwood ) , must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave ( or , perhaps , this is the only realistic element in the film )  
much of the writing is simply bad , and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act  
in one terrible scene , gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques , while pointing them out in the cafeteria  
up front , i should say that , in four years of high school , i did not eat in the cafeteria even once  
that aside , the various social groups he points out are general , uninteresting , and poorly-shown  
for instance , he points to the "" nerds , "" who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops  
it's such an obvious cliche that i can't believe rosenberg even bothered  
most of the dialogue is forced ( no one says , "" bite me ! "" 
anymore ) , and none of the scenes have any degree of wit  
this picture is not inspired , and most scenes flop from one to the other , with no sense of momentum or energy  
the blame for this can be placed on director david nutter , who apparently likes his films dry  
horror films should at least exploit violence , but this one is shockingly timid  
there are a few good scenes , though , such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum ( this is , however , the most forced scene in the film , for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn )  
i also liked the school janitor character , played by william sadler  
he has a few lines that are surprisingly thought-provoking  
the acting is largely a waste of talent  
marsden is , as i said , bland ( thought not particularly bad )  
bruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted  
stahl and holmes both show they have talent , but the direction isn't good enough to hone in on their skills ( stahl's performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads )  
none of these characters expand beyond their one dimension , and , frankly , watching cardboard cut-outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn't all that cool  
disturbing behavior is a wreck of a film , and it started out a wreck before shooting even began  
i'm surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film , or that it would make a lot of money at the box office  
it's not boring , or even blatantly awful , but it's an uninspired lump of a film  
it sure starts off nicely , but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable "

-1,"joe versus the volcano is really one of the worse movies made in very recent memory  
the strangest thing is that you would think nothing would go wrong with it  
it has a solid cast with tom hanks & meg ryan as the lead roles  
but you can never judge a movie by its cast    
if there is one good thing about joe vs the volcano , it is that the plot is original  
unfortunately , it is also incredibly stupid  
the movie begins with joe ( tom hanks ) going to work  
this opening sequence is very boring and slow  
it shows joe walking to his office  
but on the way , he has to wait in a long line passing by strange and slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious lighting  
a sequence like this should take 2 minutes  
here , it takes over 5    
it is obvious that joe hates his job  
at his office , one of his co-workers is meg ryan  
oddly enough , she plays 3 different roles in this movie ! ! 
joe leaves to go to a doctor's appointment  
his doctor informs him that he has a "" brain cloud  "" 
this means that in a few months , he will die  
so what does joe do ? 
quit his job , of course ! ! 
when he arrives home , joe meets an old man named graynamore ( lloyd bridges )  
graynamore tells joe that in order to get some important mineral for his company from an island , the natives need someone to sacrifice to their volcano to please their fire god  
by a startling coincidence , the boat trip to the island takes a few months  
by the time he reaches the island , he will almost be dead from the "" brain cloud "" anyway , so joe agrees  
graynamore gives joe a credit card to buy everything he needs to go on this "" great adventure ""  
joe goes on a date with meg ryan , his co-worker  
the day before the boat trip , joe meets one of graynamore's daughters  
she is also , surprise , meg ryan  
except she looks more hippyish  
they both have dinner and the next day , joe gets driven over to his boat  
the lady that sails the boat is another one of graynamore's daughters  
and , wonder of wonders , she is also played by meg ryan  
as they sail to the island , meg ryan tells joe that the natives of the island have a craving for orange soda  
after some stupid talking scenes , they also deduce that graynamore had his doctor be the one that joe went to  
and that the "" brain cloud "" thing was made up ! ! 
they do plently of cheap special effects on the boat voyage  
joe goes fishing and catches a hammerhead shark  
this is a cheap gag that has been pulled off many times  
but , to top it off , the shark is obviously rubber and fake ! ! 
one night there is a storm  
a cheap-looking lightning bolt strikes the boat and everything is cast overboard  
fortunately , joe and meg ryan manage to find some of the luggage that joe brought to sail  
by pure luck , they get to the island  
since the natives like orange soda , they wear soda cans as attire ! !

-1,"warning : spoilers are included in this review    
but it doesn't really make much of a difference  
deep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997  
remember when dante's peak came out in february ? 
a few months later , volcano was released  
the first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen  
the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent  
well , it's deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition  
this time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july  
of course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante's peak  
but while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film  
apparently many did , and it utterly baffles me  
to be completely honest , i haven't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life  
volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch  
deep impact doesn't just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot  
the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters  
deep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 )  
a line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above  
among these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski )  
leo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds  
he races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident  
a year passes , and nothing is heard about it again  
we are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc  
she gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell )  
she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie  
after talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help  
luckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain "" ellie "" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film    
that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled )  
before she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road  
they take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman )  
beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference  
naturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question  
and so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive  
they announce a plan called "" ark , "" which is their only hope for survival  
a computer will select 800 , 000 people at random  
these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won't kill off the entire human race  
after two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over  
the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning  
jenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom  
the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional  
it's a shame that nothing else is heartfelt  
now , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface  
the title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it ! 
by doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won't work  
director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show "" er  "" 
her major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film  
well , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one  
suggestion to ms  leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre "

-1,"according to popular film opinion , a film's greatness is determined by time  
take for example "" casablanca  "" 
great film , even today  
it's still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic  
another example would be "" star wars , "" which had a very , very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion times before  
but as i rewatched "" independence day "" when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996 , i kinda felt like it wasn't as cool as when i had first seen it  
i had liked it when i saw it the first time ( * * * was my original view ) and basically saw it as a good "" escape film  "" 
but when i rewatched it , i felt cheated  
thus , the curse of the "" event film  "" 
 "" independence day "" is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once ( except for a couple kids - the critics , in this situation )  
but after a while , this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one  
well , this kid is the "" event film "" in my little analogy  
and when i rewatched "" independence day , "" not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen , but i felt insulted the whole time  
there are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just aren't sure if it's comedy or hokey drama  
one scene , you'll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch ; the next you'll see a bunch of military uptight guys walking around , saying corny lines  
the worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of "" glen or glenda ? "" 
now this annoying kid's problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once , he shows he has no balls  
and "" independence day "" has no balls  
it plays it safe everywhere  
it throws in a ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films  
the chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of "" star wars  "" 
i mean , isn't that devil's den ? 
and the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moore's breasts in "" striptease  "" 
they're these octopus men , boring freaking octopus men  
i mean , come on  
the aliens in "" 2001 "" were more interesting and you didn't even see them ! 
basically the plot is straight from a b-movie from the 50s : aliens come to earth and we wonder if they're hostile or peaceful  
okay , it's an interesting topic , but it's not handled greatly  
now they aren't and somehow a computer geek , jeff goldblum , figure out they're using our satellites as a countdown to destruction  
yep  
these aliens are not only heavily armed , they're stupid too  
they also use the same kind of computer as we do , but that comes about later  
the president ( bill pullman ) , who's under attack for being a wimp , decides this would be a nice time to be belligerent , and he decides he'll stay in the white house which the aliens have covered  
i don't care if it's bob freaking dole in the white house , get him out of there  
i don't care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol , just get him out of there  
later on , he's stupid and wants to fly in the attack on a big alien ship  
i think it's time for impeachment for this guy  
he's more senile than reagan on pot  
then there's a cocky pilot ( will smith ) who is the only person to survive the counter-attack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area 51 ( the film's only sign of being brave )  
his girlfriend's a stripper sharing a subplot with "" striptease "" in that she has to do it for her son  
come on , she has a fighter pilot boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance  
i think she can quit that job and get a more respectable job at long john silvers  
she's also the few , the proud , the lucky to survive the igniting of l  a  ( as well as her dog , who narrowly survives )  
there are some bright spots  
they tossed in enough old film homages to keep me laughing  
the best one is when jeff goldblum ( nicely named david ) turns on his computer and a picture of hal comes up and says , "" good morning , dave  "" 
and they even played r  e  m  's 
 "" it's the end of the world as we know it ( and i feel fine ) at the beginning  
and judd hirsch steals the film by actually acting great ( he's a stereotype , but i just loved the man anyway )  
but there are no real subtle comic moments "

-1,"when respecting a director , you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect  
woody allen has made a couple less-than good films , and he's my favorite  
even martin scorsese hasn't had a perfect track record  
kevin smith , after a smashing debut with the classic "" clerks "" stooped as low to sell-out and make the dreadful "" mallrats  "" 
i mean , so far the only director who's made several films , none of which have been bad is richard linklater ( "" slacker , "" "" dazed and confused , "" "" before sunrise , "" and "" suburbia ""    all 
which were great )  
now , i adore quentin tarantino  
his first two films were classic films , the second one being one of the greatest films of all time  
but 1995 just wasn't that good of a year for him  
he made way too many tv appearances  
he mispronounced jackie chan's name on the mtv movie awards  
and he made this film  
 ( he was also awarded an oscar , so i guess that would be a grand exception )  
robert rodriguez is also a great director ; not a brilliant one , but a cool one  
i've never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film , so i can't comment on them  
but in this crap ensemble director's film , all four give pitiful efforts  
pitiful for any director , too  
now in all fairness , ensemble director pieces never really work out  
i've never seen all of "" new york stories , "" but have heard the first two films , by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap ( i saw woody's one , which was hilarious but not totally up to par )  but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film  
exposition : a simple one - a bellhop , ted ( the totally overdone tim roth , who's a god and all , but not in this one , though he has a couple good moments ) is working on new year's eve for his first shift ( ! ! ! ) in an old fancy hotel  
he's the only one there ( again : ! ! ! ) and he only has a couple rooms ( yet again : ! ! ! )  
the old bellhop ( the seemingly immortal marc lawrence - who hated pulp fiction actually ) hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily  
as the night goes on , he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile  
yea  
 ( the short films are presented in order , btw ) : 
the missing ingredient writer/director : allison anders starring : sammi davis , amanda decadenet , valeria golino , madonna , ione skye , lili taylor , alicia witt 
this one starts it off horribly with no plot , no intrigue , and crap dialogue  
the situation is so terrible that it's physically painful to watch  
the plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is ( gasp ! ) 
stuck inside some object in their hotel room  
the witch that was supposed to bring it ( ione skye ) calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it  
yeah , that's what i said  
stupid plot , inane characters who aren't interesting at all , etc , etc , etc  the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which , in turn , it wastes pitifully  
not even actually funny for a second  
my rating ( out of 5 ) : no stars ! ! ! ! 
the wrong man writer/director : alexandre rockwell starring : david proval , jennifer beals and laurence bender 
another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on  
ted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple ( david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at "" coming back "" ) who are playing sex games  
ted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon  
but at least this has a bit of comedy in it , just not that much  
and david proval has never overacted as much  
and it's "" pulp fiction "" producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window  
a masterpiece compared to the first one , but still    
the misbehavers writer/director : robert rodriguez starring : antonio banderes , tamlyn tomita , lana mckissack , danny verduzco , salma hayek 
would a robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek's navel ? 
nope  
luckily she's on the tv dancing so we get to see her  
surprisingly enough , when i read the screenplay ( about a year before actually seeing it ) , this one seemed to have the most potential  
it was fast-paced , funny , and well , funny  
but when i watched it , it seemed anti-climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once  
antonio overacts nicely and the two kids ( lana and danny ) are funny  
but , as i said , it moves slowly and in that way , it's more painful than funny "

-1,"my inner flag was at half-mast last year when nick at nite pulled "" dragnet "" reruns off the air  
sure , i'd seen them all at least once , but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra-serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv  
even though "" dragnet "" is out of circulation at the moment , we webb anti-fans still have the d  i  , a 50's propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous "" blue boy "" episode of "" dragnet  "" 
for anyone like me who got laughs out of webb's rapid-fire speeches and straight-faced seriousness , think of the d  i  
as what would happen if sgt  
joe friday ever enlisted , because he plays exactly the same character here , a no-nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long- winded , melodramatic speeches on any topic  
in this election year , i'm more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth  
the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb's office door and enters  
he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up  
the "" produced and directed by jack webb "" card pretty much goes without saying  
this is his movie all the way , and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason , i was wondering if there would even be a plot  
i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants , but the d  i  
gives us more -- much more  
webb's mission is to make a man out of private owens , the local screw-up  
the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or , the captain will "" personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself  "" 
 ( whether the "" lace panties "" part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered  ) 
this , of course , gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens' life a living hell  
for those of you who haven't been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching , here's a reprint of a typical monologue of his  
i can't duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper , but the words should at least partially convey what i'm talking about    
 "" now you listen to me , youngster  
someday you'll wake up fighting on a beach and you'll pray to god somebody doesn't get killed because of your foolishness    
i've got a headline for you : every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours , you're gonna turn around and i'll be standing right there  "" 
i couldn't write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d  i  
 ( nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame ) , but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines , like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day's work by going to the local bar ( where he orders a tomato juice )  
he meets a woman who , coincidentally , also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typically-stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch-rival , another marine d  i  
webb marches over to the table , gets up in her face and says , "" just what kind of a dame do you think you are ? "" 
bogart he ain't  
the other d  i  
gets one of the few memorable non-webb lines when he confesses to the girl , "" he's a damn good d  i  
    
i guess i'm just a little jealous  "" 
join the club , we're all jealous of jack webb's way with women , which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene , as webb finds his way to the woman's place of employment , a lingerie store , and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display  
 "" you expect me to talk to you    
in _here_ ? ! "" he exclaims , no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras  
the woman goes off to help a customer , leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen  
a little girl spots him in the store and demands , "" what are you doing in here "

-1,"my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love  
i love ralph fiennes  
i love uma thurman  
i love sean connery  
hell , i'm even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw  
i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i've been eagerly awaiting the film ever since  
a few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground  
then , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics  
and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs  
and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique  
my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things  
the film i saw today didn't even meet those expectations  
this is a lousy , incoherent mess  
i would slam it harder , if it weren't for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors  
but sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired  
that's the main problem with the avengers : for all it's hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired  
it's like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making  
it also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots  
this is just plain depressing  
the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show  
frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i've never watched an episode  
i wasn't alive then  
i don't even watch television now  
i'm very sorry that i don't have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i've already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse  
i didn't know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles  
i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film  
based on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr  peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits  
they are to work together , under mother's orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw )  
it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather  
his name is de wynter ( connery )  
he is a crazy scottish guy  
our heroes had better stop him , or else  
  
  
the weather will keep getting colder until they "" have to go to hell to warm up "" ( one of the film's few funny lines )  
along the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense  
for example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos  
now , killer bugs don't really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film  
the purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established  
they're never even directly connected to de wynter ( they're controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard )  
the special effects aren't bad , but they're loud , obnoxious , and intrusive  
like so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning  
and i guarantee you , it will wane  
i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn't do any good to think  
the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn't tell us what happens  
there are several scenes in the preview that didn't make the final cut  
in addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad )  
the scenes that don't feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast  
they aren't  
the action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film "

-1,"there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors  
when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture  
you see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries  
i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories  
i hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac's shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey  
the badness of patch adams is stupefying  
it's confounding  
i can't believe a film can be this bad  
and yet , it's based on a real man who probably has a good point to make  
in the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human  
in the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn't want to kill himself  
while there , he notices that the doctors don't care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings  
so , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients  
he goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it's good to help people  
he also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor  
naturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams  
so patch decides that he's going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have  
and that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998  
on a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn't say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter's performance , even if she is wasted )  
but the film fails fundamentally in execution  
every scene swells with grand , "" emotional "" music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard  
take , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus  
we don't know patch yet , but there's sad music , and it's supposed to make us really sad that he's sad  
later on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively  
and when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad  
but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions  
real drama is character-based  
you grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it  
we don't ever grow to know the dying patient ; he's simply a vehicle for patch's greatness  
real drama doesn't seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry  
that's why patch adams is not real drama  
it goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene  
even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman's sickening musical score  
sentimentality like this is indeed bad  
but it's not as bad as half-baked , simplistic themes  
you see , patch is a really great student  
he aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he's cheating  
but patch doesn't think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor  
 "" why don't we see patients until the third year ? "" he bursts out every three seconds  
well , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients  
not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort  
most of us have to study  
and a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn't know a toe from a finger , probably won't be too successful in preventing death  
oh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to "" prevent death , "" but to "" improve the quality of life ! "" 
yes ! 
that is true ! 
and you can not do that without studying  
you can not do that without going to medical school  
what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later  
follow the rules ? 
bah ! 
who needs the rules ! 
only uptight doctors follow the rules  
the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants  
and then there's the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic  
a free clinic

i once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person's brain with microwaves  
then i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections  
i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted  
these people had what are known as "" conspiracy theories "" - ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public  
a little imagination goes a long way  
in richard donner's conspiracy theory , jerry fletcher ( mel gibson ) is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything  
his latest , that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle , might sound outrageous to us , but is all in a day's work for him  
he combs the newspaper , looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings-on behind the scenes , and from there jerry draws his conclusions  
upstanding citizen that he is , he tries to convince alice sutton ( julia roberts ) of the justice department that the president must be warned  
lucky gal , alice , who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since  
what she doesn't know is that jerry's interest in her is far more than , well , professional  
he goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment  
but when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry's ideas and his limited-circulation "" conspiracy theory "" newsletter , he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice's help  
one of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action-thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action , nor a significant number of thrills  
part of this is a result of the film's slow pace  
it takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice , and even once that is over with , the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement  
at over two hours , this film could have been significantly condensed and had it's running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour , but even then , the action scenes would not be able to save the film  
instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces , we're treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite "" black elements "" : black helicopter , men in black action suits and body armor , black vehicles - you know the drill  
they come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons , but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time  
big deal , we've seen it all before  
watching the film , i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination , but i was out of luck  
now , when i say it took forever to set up the "" relationship "" between jerry and alice , i completely mean what one person is relative to the other , and not romantic involvement  
oh , donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie , the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other , but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring  
you see , there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies ( also directed by donner ) than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory  
the two just don't click , and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether ( like finding out he's been stalking her ) , the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced  
the script in general also seems forced , like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it , then took it and forced it upon us  
dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening  
even gibson's usual gift for ad lib couldn't punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest , although one of jerry's theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing  
unfortunately , much of what's discussed in the film is not inherently important to what's going on , but instead filler that starts out with potential , but ends up just being extraneous because it's never followed through  
for example , jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station  
he even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break ( hence the water in a subway station ) , and that the coroner should check the man's lungs for chlorine  
this is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him  
you know what happens then ? 
nothing , zip , nada  
no follow-up whatsoever , so what's the significance ? 
okay , here's another one  
a couple of well known ( real life ) assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j  d  salinger novel "" the catcher in the rye ""  
jerry also has a bunch of copies  
whenever he goes into a bookstore , he has to buy one  
leaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin , we're never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin  
not when we find out about his salinger collection , not when he goes to the bookstore , not later on when we get the answer to our first question  
the point becomes totally extraneous  
oh , did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film ? 
yeah , he plays this government psychiatrist named dr  jonas who may or may not be a bad guy  
that's about it  
for all the presence this usually marvelous actor has , he's nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory  
you can just lump him in with the supporting players , with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi  
this guy was really likable , and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time  
okay , here's my theory  
this really started out as a great film , but some of its jokes were actually true ! 
the government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security , and this was what was left over "

-1,"the last line ( or near to that honor ) is the great butler , alfred ( the ubergod , michael gough ) saying , "" i think we need a bigger bat cave , "" or something to that note  
that's exactly what this film is - too big for its own good because it has too damn much  
cut batgirl out  
cut one of the villains  
it's too much to handle in one dosage  
it's so much that characters get left behind  
poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way , shape or form  
and elle deserves better  
this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher  
it's also the fourth worst in the series ( and second worst from joel )  
the series has been declining since its stunning debut , followed by the almost-as-stunning sequel and then the anti-climactic third one ( first by joel )  
this one's not anti-climactic - i knew it was gonna suck  
it's up to joel to make it fun though  
 "" batman forever "" was fun  
this is a big bore of over-produced action sequences and shallow characters  
i mean , this one bit  
i'm gonna put all the plot in one paragraph : mr  freeze ( ah-nold ) , who's wife was dying of some disease , has become the new big villain these days  
he's a huge ex-scientist who fell into some weird liquid ( hello ? 
joker ? ) and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body  
batman ( george ) and robin ( chris ) fight him a bit but find they're growing apart  
meanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he's used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had  
she emerges from her chemicals ( don't ask 'cause i can't tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who's poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people  
she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo  
meanwhile , alfred's dying of the same disease mr  freeze's wife has ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and his niece , barbara ( alicia ) , comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not really soon , it takes her 2 hours ) becomes batgirl  
meanwhile , in an unfinished subplot , bruce ( batman's alter-ego , if you forgot ) has been dating the lovely julie madison ( the even lovlier elle macpherson ) who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing  
end of her for all we know  
mr  freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population ( don't ask ! ! ! )  
the trio must team together "" as family "" to beat them  
there ya go  
not the whole story but no big context clues  
too much , right ? 
right ! 
the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels  
however , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one  
he gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that's it  
maybe some stunts  
for all this , i can't even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy ! 
and when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say  
i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode  
george is in between them  
he's not quintessential , he's not horrible , he's good  
but i'm sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they'll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we'll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job )  
the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher  
last time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey  
this time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain ( the same guy ) , mr  freeze  
we feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants ? 
arnold isn't very good - too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points  
when he watches old movies of his wife , he actually looks somber  
wow  
but uma makes the most of her seductive character , getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness  
it's like she's almost parodying herself in "" pulp fiction "" at points  
she's incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better "
-1,"this is an adaptation of h  g  wells' acclaimed novel 'the invisible man'  
the actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue  
the director is paul verhoven  
that , plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer , should be enough to lure us into the theatre  
the problem is to keep us there  
i can't imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time  
working on a top secret military project , sebastian caine ( kevin beacon ) -- an eccentric genius , that calls himself "" god "" , has discovered the secret to invisibility  
the first two faces are completed  
now , it is time for "" the next logical step "" -- human  
caine volunteers for this risky experiment  
but when he is made invisible , something goes wrong  
while his ex-girlfriend linda ( elisabeth shue ) desperately tries to find something to return him to normal , he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower  
but that's not the bad thing -- an unexpected side-effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania  
he is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers , just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine  
soon every sense of decency is forgotten  
the little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien-rip-off , where caine is walking like a half finished terminator , spooking , scaring and killing everybody  
though it's based on a novel called 'the invisible man' , the title has been ironically changed to 'hollow man' that sums up the film very nicely  
this is a very silly production  
laughable , actually  
apparently verhoven's imagination doesn't stretch too far  
for him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls' locker room undetected  
it is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie  
being invisible , gives you the opportunity to be who you are , to do what you want without being influenced by society  
in many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences  
the nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about  
all that , the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat  
caine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man  
but since this is a modernization , in other words a dehumanization , he doesn't stop there  
he becomes a rapist  
and then , of course , a murderer  
you'll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place  
shue's talent is barely seen , josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent  
kevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully  
his face is not seen for the most part of the film , and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice  
there are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing  
in the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place  
being probably the best technical achievement since "" jurassic park "" , they are absolutely amazing  
we observe the layers of skin , muscle , tissue , and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly rendered invisible  
we see a beating heart , inflating lungs , and veins pulsing with newly-pumped blood  
there are a couple of inventive shots with smoke , fire , air and water , but are a few scenes like that worth attending a movie for ? 
what is truly disturbing is that with a great book , talented actors and a grand budget , this could have been so much more  
pretty much like jan de bont ( "" twister "" , "" haunting "" ) , paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary  
he was responsible for several good films ( "" basic instinct "" and "" starship troopers ) "" and some incredibly bad films ( "" showgirls "" , "" total recall "" ) , but he has never made anything that was great  
in a way "" hollow man "" fits perfectly in this collection  
it's not better or worse than verhoven's average film  
he proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues  
and so , instead of depth and chills , verhoven inserts some of his trademarks : stupid dialogue , and lot's of dull action with blood and naked bodies  
he even throws in some of the worst of film clich ? s - the slowly advancing fireball , the villain who comes back from the dead , etc , etc  - and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year ( you'll be screaming "" nooooo ! "" 
and attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion )  
and all we can ask is why ? 
the answer is simple "

-1,"i'm a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson's work  
he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain  
with teaching mrs  tingle , his directorial debut , williamson has reached the end of his rope  
what used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here  
the components are all there , including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to  
but where are the thrills ? 
the laughs ? 
both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge  
and what a shame that is  
i loved the scream films - heck , i even enjoyed the sci-fi goofiness of the faculty  
kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office  
teaching mrs  tingle , a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers , may put an end to his reign  
or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties  
i still have my faith , but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past  
the title character of his pet project is a vicious , uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over-the-top by british actress helen mirren  
mrs  tingle is basically every student's worst nightmare : a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard-working of her pupils  
the principal ( michael mckean ) is horrified of her , and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members  
i enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way  
mirren's performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink  
in other words , it's a poor substitute for williamson's best work  
the plot is a big problem here  
material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director  
the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann , an over-achiever hoping to get a college scholarship  
but typical mrs  tingle says her history project , which she worked on for countless hours , is laughable  
later on while studying in the gymnasium , a classmate ( barry watson ) offers her a photo-copied duplicate of mrs  tingle's final exam  
leigh ann's best friend ( marisa coughlan ) encourages her to use it  
alas , the old hag herself finds the three scheming , and snatches the test , and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning  
in the morning    
how convenient ! 
the three students head to mrs  tingle's house , attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann's name  
things get out of hand , and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle  
the plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her  
of course , not everything goes entirely to plan  
besides pointless sub-plots involving the football coach ( jeffrey tambor , horribly wasted ) , there is little by way of actual progress  
there is no urgency to the situation ; little tension or laughs are involved  
the humor is completely inconsistent  
after many of the jokes , the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze  
you continue to await some momentum in the story , something that could possibly revive the slow pace  
a moment like that never arises  
williamson also does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players , including the talented mckean and larry sanders' vet tambor  
and the beautiful vivica a  fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor , and then williamson disposes of her character entirely  
on the plus side , holmes and coughlan are admirable ( with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression ) , and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher  
while everything is pretty lifeless , teaching mrs  tingle remains watchable  
there are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again , but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script "

-1,"i went to blair witch project 2 : book of shadows with the highest of hopes  
the original film , released last summer , was genuinely scary and terrifying ; i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor  
unfortunately , my hopes were soon dashed  
as the movie opens , the audience is shown pseudo-documentary clips of burkittsville , maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie  
it's a mostly humorous , self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film  
during this segment , we are introduced to the protagonist , a young man who sells blair witch-related memorabilia from his website  
the movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously  
we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia , but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies  
we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him  
we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him  
no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution ; in fact , these scenes are barely referred to again  
i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally , a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting , filthy interiors , and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie  
the movie cuts again , this time to the present  
the young man , whose name is jeffrey ( played by jeffrey donovan -- as in the first movie , the character names are identical to the actors' names , although this movie admits up front that it is fictional , so there's no reason for the practice this time around ) , is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the "" blair witch hunt , "" which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website  
we meet tristen and steven , a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience  
steven is a skeptic , believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria  
tristen , on the other hand , believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence  
she is wan and soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly  
 ( she also complains that she feels nauseated ; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant , and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out  
how did i know ? 
because in bad movies , nauseated women are always pregnant  ) 
the fourth member of their party is erica , a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch , not evil  
they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery  
kim is dressed completely in black , has extreme goth-style makeup on , and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities , but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch  
presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; it's never explained  
the party of five heads off into the woods as promised  
they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr's house and set up camp , complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night's events  
there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well , but after a few words are exchanged , the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere  
the movie veers off at this point to spend many long , long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down  
sexual innuendoes are tossed around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consumed , and nothing much else happens  
this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary  
the next day , the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed , and that steven and tristen's manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds , like snow  
the videotapes are missing , but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim , they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house , "" right where the original blair witch tapes were found ! "" 
ooh  
spooky  
the team goes back to jeffrey's house -- a creepy old civil war-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and review the tapes  
they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night  
wacky hijinks ensue  
tristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch , everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on their bodies , steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations , and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket  
throughout the entire ordeal , jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes , which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps ; eventually tristen wanders in , mutters something about "" reverse , "" and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards  
when they do this , they discover what really happened during the five lost hours  
 ( one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes  
okay , if the videotapes were being buried , then how were they recording themselves    oh , 
nevermind  ) 
this movie was awful  
simply awful  
the characters are broadly-drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development  
erica is the nature-loving wiccan  
tristen is the weak and sympathetic woman  
steven is the overbearing asshole  
kim is the antisocial goth girl "

-1,"54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring  
a greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives , flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors  
i , however , would rather cut to the chase  
54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring  
there is nothing in it -- not a glimpse of depth , nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight  
there is no electricity in any of the scenes , or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots  
and it's underdeveloped , and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they're in this year's boogie nights  
they are so wrong  
the picture has been assembled by mark christopher  
based on this film , i don't know how he got a job in the business  
54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name , which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s  
i don't know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released , but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson's brilliant work in every possible way , from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography  
what it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great : depth , intelligence , energy , fascinating characters , and challenging themes  
54 can't even measure up to the last days of disco , which is flawed , but still smart and entertaining  
it's remarkably bad timing , i'd say , to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind  
i have exaggerated , though : there is one interesting character , and one terrific performance  
that character is steve rubell , played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves  
steve rubell is the owner of studio 54 , and if christopher had focused on him , then myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself  
alas , we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane ( ryan phillippe ) , a going-nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club , thanks to rubell's homosexual impulses  
it's here that he meets his friends , the array of uninteresting characters : his co-worker , greg ( brecklin meyer ) , his wife , anita ( salma hayek ) , and , of course , the love interest , julie black ( neve campbell )  
shane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning , and he has a reasonably sturdy home life  
 ( some of the scenes with his father border on interesting , while heather matarazzo , who plays his sister , pushes phillippe off the screen  ) 
but he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene , and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs  
why his "" friends "" push him into drugs is never really explained , but the fact that they are "" friends "" is questioned only is superficial ways ( greg gets really mad at shane because he's been elevated to bartender status )  
there isn't a single conflict that takes center stage , except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works  
most of the film is dumb , and most of the dialogue is inane  
there's a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black , and , in the next scene , they're arm-in-arm without a bit of development  
then , they're kissing in a bowling alley ! 
this is five minutes of material , thrown into the picture at the last minute ( well past the one-hour mark , and this isn't a long film to begin with )  
campbell is a talented actress , but she needs a role that gives her a little depth  
this one doesn't  
and phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever ; this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg's star-making role in boogie nights  
he seems dumb and misguided , and his voice never changes tone  
i guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body , but he seems pretty lanky to me  
he's all wrong for a lead role , but it doesn't help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters  
by the end of 54 , shane's most notable trait is his stupid , fake accent  
the rest of the performances are wasted  
hayek is an energetic , talented young actress , and does almost nothing here  
meyer is endearing , but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard  
only myers , by sheer force of talent , manages to rise above christopher's wading-pool of a script  
rubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters , but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance  
in fact , myers is the sole reason to see 54 , and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him  
i've read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail  
frankly , i don't care  
it's easy to recreate something technical like this  
a fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task  
besides , christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible , anyway  
aside from myers' performance , 54 is a complete failure  
it's dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring  
some may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair , but they're so obvious to me  
in any event , 54 is pallid without the contrast  
it doesn't even work as mindless entertainment : it's so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it "
-1,"conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that children's items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty-five or thirty years after the item was made  
that's when the kids of that time have jobs , disposable income and a desire to re-visit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives  
check out the prices of toys from the late sixties and you'll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks  
there's a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen  
boomers are now mostly in their forties and fifties and have lived in the work-a-day world for a long time  
they'd like to re-capture some of that fun they remember from days of yore  
hollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them  
directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that time  
and for the most part they're messing it up  
 "" mission impossible "" , "" lost in space "" , "" godzilla "" , "" zorro ""  
none of these successfully capture the originals  
none of these are even good films  
you can now add "" the avengers "" to the list  
the british television series began in 1961  
super secret agent john steed ( then-patrick macnee ) and his third partner , emma peel ( then-diana rigg ) are the pair that the american audience fell for  
surrealistic and witty , the series fit the mood of the times  
the leather-clad rigg probably didn't hurt the ratings either  
after all it's not a coincidence that you can't pronounce her character's name without "" appeal ""  
now we're in the nineties  
steed ( now-ralph fiennes ) and peel ( now-uma thurman ) are battling evil genius sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) who is screwing with england's weather  
that's about as much of a plot as we have  
there's some footage about a lot of other things that either don't make sense or make even less sense  
we get betrayal for some unknown reason  
evil clones appear and vanish and have no connection to the film  
remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason  
there's a high tech hot air balloon , but i have no idea why anyone's in it  
the spy agency is run by a man called "" mother "" who is in a wheelchair and a woman named "" father "" who is blind    at 
least in some scenes  
there's probably a reason for all of this , but we'll never know it  
macnee makes an appearance of sorts  
he is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing  
a group of villains sits around a table , all clad in huge pastel-colored teddy bear outfits  
at first it's humorous to watch the teddies waddle around , but then it becomes goofy  
the movie is a medley of clutter , confusion and wrong decisions around every corner  
it feels like major portions of the film are missing  
the storyline jumps rather than flows  
reportedly the film was re-cut several times  
this is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing  
there's one good point where peel is running from one room to another in a house designed by escher  
other than that , the effects are second-rate  
the weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes  
thurman almost makes an adequate emma peel but it doesn't work  
she looks good , dresses in all the right fetish outfits but there's no spark  
fiennes fares even less well  
macnee's steed was a witty man of the world with a sense of humor  
fiennes' agent comes across as a dour kid in grown-up clothes who has never been out of his home town  
even connery , one of the greatest living actors , doesn't have much of a presence outside of a few fiery scenes  
the action scenes are difficult to follow  
director jeremiah chechik ( responsible for the atrocious remake of "" diabolique "" ) somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it shouldn't be "

-1,"and i thought "" stigmata "" would be the worst religiously-oriented thriller released this year  
turns out i was wrong , because while "" stigmata "" was merely boring and self-important , "" end of days "" is completely inept on all fronts  
it's a silly , incomprehensible , endlessly stupid mess  
for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best , it's extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up  
for the first time in recent memory , an arnold action movie ( and "" batman & robin "" doesn't count ) is no fun at all  
 "" end of days "" is a major stinker  
the movie opens in vatican city , 1979  
some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy , which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation  
if he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 , 1999 , the world will be destroyed  
the pope orders protection of this girl , though some priests believe she ought to be killed  
in new york , that very night , a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy  
twenty years later , we meet jericho cane ( schwarzenegger ) , a suicidal ex-cop with a drinking problem  
now working as a security guard for hire , he is protecting a local businessman ( gabriel byrne ) , who is actually possessed by the devil  
an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after , christine york ( robin tunney )  
recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine ( including ownership of the same music box , apparently ) , jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her  
there are so many problems with this film it's hard to know where to begin , but how about starting with the concept ? 
casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with  
schwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea  
arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions  
in other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake  
harrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they've all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger  
there are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho's character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine's location by offering him his old life back  
none of these scenes really work , because arnie isn't up to the task  
the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before  
this one isn't at all believable the way arnold plays him  
the supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all  
as the prince of darkness , he's suave and confident  
he acts like one would expect the devil to act  
the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain  
byrne out-performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil  
byrne's speech about the bible being "" overrated "" actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold's attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the "" 'tis not ! "" 
variety ) are feeble at best  
the only problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares  
kevin pollack plays jericho's security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after about an hour  
robin tunney isn't given much to do except look scared  
in fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , save for byrne , is given anything interesting to do  
performances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it  
this being an action blockbuster , it's no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script , which starts off totally confusing , and when some of it is explained ( and not much of it is ) , it's utterly ridiculous  
why is the devil coming on new year's eve , 1999 ? 
because it's exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which isn't 666 , it turns out  
some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the beginning , and you've got 1999 ! 
if you don't buy this explanation , you're not alone  
it's convoluted and silly at the same time  
the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous ( she's christine , see , and she lives in new york , see  
  
  ) , and if that weren't bad enough , there's plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn't explained at all  
why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street , but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex-cop , he's powerless ? 
is he impervious to only one kind of bullet ? 
how come he can't control jericho or christine ? 
and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies ? 
a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this , but it's never actually explained  
usually , this sort of thing wouldn't matter in a schwarzenegger flick ( i mean , don't get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies ) , but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting  
there are several predictable horror film clich ? s present in "" end of days , "" complete with the old "" black cat hiding in a cabinet "" bit , not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there  
it gets so formulaic that it's possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a "" boo "" will come  
their predictions will rarely be wrong  
the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless , partially because we don't care about these characters ( due to the script's pathetic attempts at characterization and setup ) , and also because they , too , don't make any sense  
there's a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady  
it's good for a few chuckles , but not much else "

-1,"when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects  
while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don't think that they are completely to blame for this movie's failure  
it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the "" unseen "" terrors , and it was about as scary as a dust bunny  
so special effects or not , if the story isn't the least bit scary , you aren't going to end up with a very frightening movie  
the thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern  
dern is always great , and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie  
as i sat through the seemingly endless , albeit fairly impressive , special effects , i kept wishing that this movie was about dern's caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast  
never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie  
liam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear  
he decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion  
he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia  
and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings-on  
catherine zeta-jones , lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects  
like the original , taylor's character is the star of the movie  
but since she doesn't quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms  zeta-jones , their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original  
and let's face it , probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta-jones  
i'll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren't in it  
but the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets  
they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients  
there really isn't much of a story here  
just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with  
and the special effects are great  
in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere  
in other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the "" cool shots "" quota  
at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary -- funny , maybe  
but not scary  
then we have the set  
when i first saw the house , i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it  
but it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did , and decided to take the idiotically overdone route  
this included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves  
what part did these rooms play in the story ? 
absolutely none  
they were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie  
then we have the actors  
lili taylor has never been one of my favorites  
and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in , she comes in around the average or slightly below mark  
i have no idea why liam neeson took this role  
he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus  
his character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him  
i have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman  
zeta-jones was cast because she is too hot for words  
the fact that her character is bi-sexual is just icing on the cake  
all catherine has to do in this movie is look good  
fortunately that is something she does very well  
while she does have a fairly good size part , it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye-candy  
it's too bad someone of her talents wasted them here  
any random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role  
the haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999's horror movies , the blair witch project  
the haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget , while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares  
both prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film  
if the story sucks , it's all downhill from there "

when you mention the book great expectations , i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class , where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch  
yes , it's a classic of literature , but it was a rather dry one , shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine  
certainly , the experience wasn't truly that bad , but , to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book , "" i'm not going to tell the story the way it happened    i'll 
gonna tell it the way i remember it  "" 
anyway , to return from nostalgia lane , and get back to the present , hollywood , in it's trendy attempt to modernize the classics , now presents an updated film version of great expectations  
instead of pip , this time the central character is named finn ( played as a boy by jeremy kissner , and by ethan hawke as an adult )  
finn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie , or should that be mrs  joe , ( kim dickens ) , and her boorish fisherman husband , joe ( chris cooper )  
the setting is the florida coast during the mid-70s  
finn is a blooming artist , and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish ( one of his two favorite subjects )  
during one of these escapades , he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal ( robert deniro )  
borrowing a page from the superhuman max cady , deniro's criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity , and favors hiding on the ocean floor  
ok    maybe 
that's an exaggeration , but he certainly beats any of houdini's records in the opening scenes of the film  
and that's nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finn's motorboat , but i digress  
anyway , finn does the convict a good deed , just to show that he's a really swell guy  
and then the plot moves on  
enter miss havisham    or 
ms  dinsmoor here ( anne bancroft )  
abandoned at the altar some 26 years ago , ms  dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid  
with bizarre clothing , eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup , anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role  
although she ends up nowhere near a believable character , she does add some humor to the film  
joe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner , but the insane ms  dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece , estella ( raquel beaudene as a young girl , gwyneth paltrow as an adult )  
for no apparent reason , other than to provide the main plot of the film , finn is instantly stricken for the estella  
perhaps it's her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person , or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before  
in any case , neither as children nor adults , chemistry simply doesn't exist between the two , and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her  
even when , as an adult , finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor , reacquaints himself with estella , and draws her portrait in the nude , there's nothing  
in fact , there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnear's gay artist during a similar scene in as good as it gets  
at this point , the audience has grown as cold and detached as estella's character , and couldn't care less about the two characters  
the bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow  
she fails to imbue estella , a remote character in the book , with even the vaguest traces of humanity  
there's obviously something wrong when , watching the film , you're more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character  
without a strong estella , finn's obsession seems baseless  
you wish he would just stop whining , let estella marry his rival , walter plane ( an oddly subdued hank azaria ) , and just get on with his life  
in fact , the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot  
finn's relationship with his brother-in-law , joe , is interesting , if a bit stereotypical  
what's more fascinating are his interactions with deniro  
although it's only a bit part , it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create  
it is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film  
some of the shots work , but others are too obviously staged ( for example , both of the water fountain scenes ) to have any impact  
finn's art ( actually the creations of italian painter , francesco clemente ) is used throughout the film , but it mostly fails to have the intended effect "

but , when darren meets an attractive , but cold-blooded and manipulative , psychiatrist , judith ( amanda peet ) , the long time friendship is placed in danger  
it's up to wayne and j  d  to rescue their best friend in "" saving silverman  "" 
 "" silverman "" has its heart in the right place , but the story , by newcomers hank nelken and greg depaul , is too lightweight to sustain the tale of the battle for darren's soul  
based on their experience of a friend making a major marital mistake , the story is centered on the three , life long amigos  
when wayne introduces darren to judith , he doesn't realize that he has opened a pandora's box of disaster for himself and j  d  judith was once in a relationship where her boyfriend was the dominant figure until he died in a kick boxing match

thinking about it , this is a real mishmash of contrivance and coincidence that is held together solely by the comedic efforts of steve zahn and jack black  
the pair is able to elicit the film's only laughs with their goofy antics and child-like behavior  
they are relegated to providing slapstick guy humor and the two are more than equal to the task  
steve zahn has been steadily honing his comedic acting skills and gives some complexity to wayne , the "" brains "" of the gang  
jack black has the big-guy moves of a chris farley , giving j  d  an amusing physical presence  
the neat thing is that the two actors are able to get fresh laughs from stale material

jason biggs is the straight man of the musketeers and gets very little to do ; though having watched his previous films ( "" american pie "" and "" loser "" ) i'm not sure what attraction biggs actually has  
amanda peet is caustic as the manipulative judith  
there is no humanity at all to her character as she single-mindedly strives to recreate darren into her mind's image  
she's a monster that wayne and j  d  must defeat to save their friend  
unfortunately , there is no dimension to her character  
amanda detmer brings nothing ( or gets nothing ) as darren's one and only  
r  lee ermey , as the psychotic coach , made a bad decision taking this role  
tune-meister neil diamond gives a good-natured cameo perf as the boys' idol and savior  
production values are on par with the rest of the film - lackluster and non-involving  
director dennis dugan has a track record for broad comedy with films like "" big daddy "" and "" beverly hills ninja , "" but falls flat with "" saving silverman  "" 
the 2001 movie year has yet to provide us with a "" good "" film to sink our teeth into

-1,"the following review encompasses two versions of dune : 
dune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book  
the film's visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative  
dune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television  
it was disowned by director david lynch but it's considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline  
quality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web  
 * * * the review * * * 
released in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert's cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans  
director david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico  
the screenplay was lynch's own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected  
dune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors  
the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that's home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange  
the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe  
it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it  
most importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to "" fold space "" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish  
lynch's film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story's two main strands  
one is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis  
the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen  
the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom  
unfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended  
the thinking among universal's oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office  
with lynch's initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made  
what a great idea ! 
why not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ? 
the most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters  
thus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul's father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless  
the end result is a distinct chill : we can't warm to most of the cast and we don't care much for them  
and it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book  
dune is also a very serous film  
the constant "" self-talk "" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment  
the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them  
humour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen's mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find  
you may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus' star wars trilogy  
the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however  
it still possesses enough of lynch's stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi  
special effects whiz carlo rambaldi's giant sandworms are an awesome sight  
both the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original  
and the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years  
with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses  
see it in the widescreen format if you can  
and despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen  
sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who's secret aim is to manipulate paul's destiny for its own shadowy ends  
as paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade  
the conclusion ? 
any assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert's original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker  
david lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects  
dune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release  
many chose to stay away altogether , as the film's disastrous box office showing attests  
the extended version , however , is a rather different beast  
in 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition "" director's cut "" of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres  
but , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects  
in a way , then , it is partly lynch's own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa  
stung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director's guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with "" allen smithee "" , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work  
he also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous "" judas booth ""  
certainly , looking at the results of mca's handiwork there's at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object  
but these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas "

mean , an evil man  
he vows revenge on that man and is taught the ways of the musketeer by some old dude who used to be one himself ? 
anyway , fourteen years go by and    arrgh , well , you know the rest    swish-swish-zzzzzzz ! 
critique : this is a pretty bad movie  
let's see , where should i start ? 
okay , first of all , the story is just plain boring  
it's not original , is entirely predictable and lacks energy  
okay , what's next ? 
acting , you say  
hmmmm , well , the main actor , justin chambers , is basically an uncharismatic version of chris o'donnell but with less range ( think about that ! ) , and mena suvari , is just plain off  
not as bad as thora birch was in dungeons & dragons , but entirely miscast , with bad deliveries , awful sequences and a piss-poor accent that comes and goes  
now i'm not sure if this was ms  suvari's fault or the director's , but i've definitely seen her at a much higher level than in this film  
the only semi-saving grace actor-wise is tim roth as the irrepressible "" bad guy "" , but once again , it's not something that we haven't seen before    a 
thousand times    by the same guy ! ! 
tim , please    for the love of god , beg your agent to ask the marketplace for some modern day "" american roles "" for you as a "" nice guy "" in a romantic comedy or something  
stretch , dude    stretch ! ! 
we all know that you can do much better than this gunk  
alright , what else was bad in this film ? 
oh yeah , the score ! 
yikes , how's about taking it down a few notches there , fellas ? 
this thing blares in your ear whenever it feels the need to accentuate a certain scene , but actually does little more than annoy  
i think it's important for the man behind the music to recognize that this film isn't a "" real epic "" by any stretch of the imagination  
it's a fluffy rehashed cake-walk created by some "" shrewd "" studio heads who decided to take advantage of the whole "" kung-fu "" phenomenon in films , and test it out on an old classic  
dudes    you 
failed all around ! 
 ( keep reading ) 
the editing is also pretty shoddy in this movie , the dialogue banal and stilted and the plot problems    plentiful ! 
 ( why does the guy on top of the horse carriage just stand there when his opponent takes forever scampering his way back to the top ? 
why don't they just cut the mouseketeer's rope at the top of the tower , instead of jumping down on their own chords and fighting him while hanging ? 
why doesn't anybody look a day older , when the sequence says "" 14 years later "" ? 
 ( at least    change 
your shirt , man ! ) 
keep in mind that i have never strayed away from championing certain movies that are created simply for the sake of a "" fun time "" , but this flick just didn't cut it for me  
it was boring for stretches , the acting was atrocious at times ( the "" romantic "" scene between suvari and chambers next to the lake reminded me of plays in high school which made you cringe ) , there was little reason to care for anyone and since when were the musketeers fat ? 
i will give the movie this much , and that is that its main reason for being ( its "" raison-d'etre "" , as the french would say ) , its fight sequences , do come through despite the lack of their numbers in the film  
i was hoping that the movie would be packed with cool stuntwork as promoted in its trailer , but what you see there , are essentially the snippets from the two major ( and cool ) swashbuckling sequences from the film  
the first comes right at the beginning of the movie , while the other essentially finishes the film off , hanging from the tower and juggling off ladders  
the ladder sequence itself is a definite keeper but unfortunately the rest of the movie is just regurgitated crap  
and can anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her name placed at the top of this film's credits ? 
hullo ?

-1,"underwater science fiction stays submerged 
sphere a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman 
one of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents  
you keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered  
psychologist norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of a plane crash  
when he arrives at the site , he discovers that there is no plane , but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting 1 , 000 feet below the surface for almost 300 years  
having written a paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact , he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship  
his group as outlined in his report , consists of beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist ; harry adams ( samuel l  jackson ) , a mathematician ; and ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist  
unfortunately it turns out that the writing was a blow-off project for goodman who did it for the money and named his then-colleagues to the team  
 "" after all , "" he explains , "" who reads government documents ? "" 
lead by harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , a top secret federal operative , the group descends to a mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel  
once there they stroll over , knock on the door and explore the still-operational ufo  
discovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere  
when adams enters the sphere , the weirdness unfolds  
a storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer  
 "" my name is jerry  
i am happy "" flashes across the screen  
this is unsettling for the psychologist  
 "" what happens if jerry gets mad ? "" he asks  
barnes is more pragmatic : he needs a last name because he can't put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry  
then the situation turns bad  
deadly beasts appear from nowhere  
a gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel  
lethal sea snakes attack goodman  
a giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading "" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea ""  
the suspicious scientists turn against each other  
this has all the makings of a first-rate thinking man's science fiction film  
however even the finest ingredients don't go very far in the hands of a chief who doesn't seem to care about his product  
director barry levinson has churned out a mish-mosh that doesn't engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes  
the first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification  
it's much like speed-reading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances  
it doesn't get any better when the action scenes begin  
while the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles , the people are still flat  
oddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them  
after adams experiences the interior of the sphere , no one bothers to ask him what happened  
their history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited  
even goodman and halperin's ill-conceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing  
her psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing  
there's a truism that items shown early in a movie must be used before the ending , but here they are far too obvious  
when an emergency mini-sub is explained , you know what's going to happen  
the movie affectations are nothing more than distracting  
chapter headings that divide the movie have no function  
the shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos  
much of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow  
although some of the disorientation eventually is understandable , a great deal of it isn't  
even a science fiction film must be internally consistent  
there's too much here that doesn't make sense  
are the manifestations real ? 
the jellyfish kill queen latifa ( in a throw-away role ) and the squid nearly destroys the outpost , but the bites of the fatal snakes have no effect  
a scene in the sub suggests that it's illusion , but earlier episodes indicate that it's not  
not everything has to be explained to death , but there are major questions that the film never answers  
where the ship came from is clarified , but how it ended up on the ocean floor in 1709 is merely alluded to  
even the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll  
the climax is followed by 15 minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale "

-1,"synopsis : sullen julie james , still haunted by nightmares of the killer ben willis from i know what you did last summer , perks up when her new best friend karla wilson wins a trip for four to the bahamas  
arriving at the start of the hurricane season , julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize they've walked into a trap set by the rainslickered slasher with a huge hook for a hand  
comments : i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here , but i have never seen an episode of the fox tv series "" party of five  "" 
i am only vaguely aware of the show's premise , and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i half-paid attention to while watching the tube  
 "" party of five , "" i do know however , seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre  
neve campbell , scream queen of the 90s and star of scream , scream 2 , and the craft , is a regular of the show  
so too is jennifer love hewitt  
lo and behold , following in the footsteps of campbell , hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own : the i know what you did last summer line  
though the original film , released last year , was watchable enough , this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater's glowing red exit sign longingly throughout  
jennifer love hewitt is a very good-looking young leading lady ; however , unlike neve campbell , hewitt struggles with acting  
she just isn't convincing in this film ( and she wasn't in the original either )  
this puts many young males , including myself , in a paradoxical quandary : she's very attractive , but the annoying , spoiled , valley girl-type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize , exploitatively , her figure  
add to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy , another rising teen tv star , and you get one frustrated male audience  
i've spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for a reason  
i still know what you did last summer , though cashing in on the success of the original , ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses  
nothing else here is original or interesting  
this movie , in fact , makes other recent so-so horror films like urban legend and john carpenter's vampires seem like stunning works of high art  
i still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches : an isolated location , a storm , parentless teenagers , false alarm nightmares , lots of blue-lighted darkness scenes , a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him , knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere , etc  you get the picture  
the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killer's hook  
they may as well have huge targets painted on them  
like scream and its numerous knockoffs , these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief  
unfortunately , i still know's characters aren't all that funny  
in particular , one character , a chain-weed-smoking guy , is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesn't die soon enough  
the death scenes , by the way , are relatively violent for a theatrically released horror film  
several of them are uncomfortable to watch , and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser : bloodline , a truly sadistic movie  
this , too , did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for  
and what is the deal with the slasher himself ? 
i know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre , but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror  
come on , the guy looks like the gorton's fisherman , and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate  
though his lightning-lit appearances ellicited much-needed laughter in the theater , his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film , and that's * really * saying something  
so , all that's left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy  
both prance about in tightfitting , revealing outfits or in various states of undress , yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene  
hewitt , however , does do a post-shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite  
  
  titillating  
this scene alone made this one-star turkey earn two stars under my rating system  
otherwise , hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves  
early in the film , for instance , brandy wins the trip to the bahamas  
she and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever  
i needed extra-strength tylenol after that part  
oh , and the film's conclusion , talk about repetitive ! 
people who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still know's ending at least 5 minutes before it happens  
boring ! 
i saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater  
admission is only one dollar on wednesdays , and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them  
it's usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience , who don't seem to mind participating in a mass "" mystery science theater 3000 "" -type viewing  
i still know what you did last summer , however , produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience , underscoring how bad it * really * is  
if it weren't for the main actresses' revealing wardrobes , i'd have had a very , very hard time sitting through this lame sequel  
i can't imagine trying to watch it on video ( horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation ) and wouldn't recommend it to people , unless they're horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy  
i read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works  
what a depressing thought  
hewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act "

-1,"kate ( jennifer aniston ) is having some problems  
it appears the twenty-eight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder , and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired  
she learns that her problems are related , as the owner of her advertising agency , mr  mercer ( kevin dunn ) , explains to her that her single status does not bode well with the company  
her freedom would make her more likely to leave the company , taking clients with her  
a solution presents itself in nick ( jay mohr ) , a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coincidence and gets photographed with  
kate's boss , darcy ( illeana douglas ) , uses the photograph to fabricate a wedding engagement between kate and nick  
kate is at first repulsed by the idea , but after getting immediate positive results , she pursues it  
her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan  
the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc ?  
at a dinner with kate's bosses he will provoke a fight and they will break up  
she meets nick to propose the plan  
he accepts  
kate's new status brings unexpected results in other areas  
the office bad boy , sam ( kevin bacon ) , who wouldn't give kate the time of day , now does  
now that she is engaged , he pursues an affair with her , as doing so would destroy her good girl image , hence sam's sudden interest  
things start to fall apart for kate , as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her , and does not wish to break up with her  
after some provoking nick does oblige , but problems continue for kate  
it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available  
or maybe kate does like nick , but "" reconciliation "" will force her to admit her lies to her employer  
adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother ( olympia dukakis ) , who wants her to get married and settle down  
there is a scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is ( from the waist up ) only wearing a bra  
it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one  
there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer  
it's like the director said 'well , we know the story is formulaic and the performances aren't that great so , what the heck , let's show jennifer's assets as often and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating  "" 
quite frankly it's insulting  
i don't think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie  
she did a decent enough job in ed burns' "" she's the one "" because it was a smaller and supporting role , and she just doesn't deliver the goods effectively in this movie  
her performance was not convincing  
unfortunately , as far as romantic comedies go , this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies  
the film is similar to "" my best friends wedding "" in a sense that the leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her actions , gets no sympathy from me when things go awry  
i didn't care for how quickly kate puts down nick's profession by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn't glamorous enough for her co-workers  
at least "" my best friends wedding "" changed the formula a bit and had a somewhat surprise ending  
no such luck with "" picture perfect ""  
every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away , including a couple that really made no sense  
after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company , why would she blindly throw it all away when she should have made sure that nick would even talk to her first , let alone consider a relationship ? 
was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick ? 
throw in the fact that i don't think nick and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of a decision  
i believe that kate liked him , but liked him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away ? 
i doubt it  
and what of the ending scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the couple ? 
are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers ? 
well , i guess of the congregation consists of movie extras and the strangers are the movies two lead stars , then that would make sense  
picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron

-1,"this review contains spoilers , but believe me , i don't say anything you can't guess 10 minutes into the movie  
i * did * go into this one with high expectations  
i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks  
i sort of expected another exorcist or the shining  
i even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film  
boy , was i wrong ! 
another garbage slasher flick , the only difference being that * this * one has a story ! 
the story , you ask ? 
well , a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk  
he takes it home , somehow getting it past customs : - ) and starts fiddling with it in his attic  
lo and behold , after he takes it apart , three demons appear and start taking him apart , but with meat hooks  
when they're finished , his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling  
they botch up their cleanup job , however , and manage to leave his heart ( or some gland ; i didn't really recognize the organ ) under a floorboard  
the guy's brother and his brother's wife appear at the door soon after , and decide to move in  
they throw away scumball's belongings , and set up house  
turns out that wife is a bit of a nympho , and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage  
she starts having some wild hallucinations  
later , hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards ( slow-mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground--all from the tiny cut on his hand )  
said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumball's organ  
the organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing  
it establishes mind contact with wife , who agrees to help him get more blood , because she really wants to be screwed again  
so , she helps him kill three businessmen  
scumball , at this time , gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back  
problem is , he doesn't have any skin , and even after three or four corpses , still doesn't get any skin  
he finally gets some , though , but strangely enough , he ends up looking like his brother  
guess they couldn't get the original actor back  
who knows  
scumball ( whose name is frank ) is not a nice guy  
he describes his torture by the demons fondly , as the "" ultimate pleasure and pain , since at that level there is no difference between the two  "" 
somehow , i don't see getting torn apart by 90 fish- and meat-hooks a lot of fun  
this guy is * so * bad ( "" how bad * is * he ? "" ) , 
 * so * bad that the * rats * cower in a corner in fear  
for good reason , too ; he crucifies two of them for fun , and carves a third while the nympho's horsing around with hubby  
anyway  hubby's daughter ( who , if course , is not * wife's * daughter ) starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams  
the dumb bimbo meets scumball , and is not impressed  
she manages to escape with the chinese puzzle , and brings out the demons  
at any rate , the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup ; they're normally quite meticulous about that type of thing  
the story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake  
the demons are not , however , the good guys  
the dumb bimbo's the good guy  
she somehow not only gets them to take care of frank , but also banishes them to hell or oblivion , we're not too sure which  
not too shabby for someone with single-digit iq  
this is basically a "" bad jinn "" story  
it is an * awful * movie  
awful acting , bad focus in the photography , many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks , which is really unrealistic , and looks like the latex that it is  
continuity ? 
who cares  
acting ? 
 * terrible *  
script ? 
horrible  
sounds canned  
unrealistic  
story is so-so , but the impact is lost long , long before the film ends  
i do think the * rat * acting was quite good  
i have never seen rats look afraid  
they should get nominated for an award "

-1,"i read the new yorker magazine and i enjoy some of their really in-depth articles about some incident  
they will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail  
it becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested , and what kind of pressure the investigators are under , and just about any other aspect you can think of  
frequently i get the feeling that the article sounded exciting , but i am being told in more detail than i really wanted to know  
often i get to the middle of a story and say , ok , it sounded good but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject  
film is a different medium  
it is a visual medium  
that slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize  
i frequently am surprised to find out how short a film script is and how much of the pages are empty space  
the magazine article and the film script are two very different media  
the insider is a film adaptation of the vanity fair article "" the man who knew too much "" by marie brenner  
it is too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film  
it really verges on being tedious at least at times  
for years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy side-effects  
but they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it  
the business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco  
the tide turned when a former vice-president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking  
the resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at cbs  
who were the major people involved , what were their motives , how was the story almost killed , how did it get aired anyway ? 
that is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider  
this all could have been enthralling , but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well  
and in the end , he failed  
to make a long story short , the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short  
the film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist  
we get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand  
they go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace ( played by christopher plummer )  
there the news team under producer lowell bergman ( al pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it  
this seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story , but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists , we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world  
terrorists can grab the headlines , but the tobacco companies have the real position of power  
incongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home  
we discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly  
he had been a very profitably rewarded vice-president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco ; now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family  
rather than support him his wife liane ( diane venora ) demands of him what are they supposed to do for income  
meanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand  
they offer wigand $12 , 000 just to interpret the data  
wigand's severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings , but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms  
he is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman  
in spite of the secrecy , wigand's former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role  
and so the game begins  
wigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer  
meanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family  
the film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants  
wigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out  
he and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight  
al pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider  
the story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail  
the film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience  
the musical score by pieter bourke , lisa gerrard , and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory  
it puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling  
also disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace  
plummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too well-known for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly  
this film might have been a really engaging experience under another director's control "

-1,"capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence  
visually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver's travels and treat it as an action film  
that makes it a film without much center  
 , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 
pierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a  k  a  monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire  
it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver's travels  
humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift's island of the houyhnhnms  
the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet  
it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that  
when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish  
the final irony of the original version has become film history  
without it there could never have been a "" planet of the apes "" film series  
i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language  
in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language  
that could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking  
serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film  
justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending  
but serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear  
few viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history  
partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith's best if not his best  
when the film's success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s  
while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases  
the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973  
now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again  
for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton's new version is even less faithful  
first , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes  
he has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes  
that could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes  
as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring  
in 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world's most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes  
then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet  
 ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect  ) 
he quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks  
and the language they talk is earth- english  
apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that  
the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn't occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film  
both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english  
in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships  
outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic  
leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter  
ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power  
she is bent on making the world a better place  
perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari  
in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film  
she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward  
it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes  
this is a further abandonment of the source material  
the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each's place in this reversed society , each important in the book  
we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down "

patch adams a film review by michael redman copyright 1999 by michael redman 
mediocrity is a pox on civilization  
in our heavily consumer oriented society , there is an enormous demand to churn out "" stuff  "" 
what would happen to our economy if we didn't feel the need to have more things ? 
to make us buy more , businesses need to produce a ton of product  
the sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality  
the film industry is like any other  
in order for studios to survive , they have to make money  
the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit  
some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that , less talented people are used  
there aren't enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary  
for some reason , it's never crossed anyone's mind that the real equation is quality films = more profit  
often , mediocre films are more of a pain for the audience than the horrendous ones  
at you can have a good time making fun of bad movies  
i'm not suggesting that "" patch adams "" was tossed out just to rake in the bucks  
my guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel  
it features an accomplished actor and a potentially engrossing story , but it's as dull as could be  
hunter "" patch "" adams' ( robin williams ) desire to become a doctor has an unusual genesis  
checking himself into a mental institute after a suicide attempt , he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning around  
patch could be a poster boy for co-dependency  
he explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he doesn't focus on his own problems  
he decides that he wants to be a physician , leaves the place and a couple of years later enrolls in the medical college of virginia  
as a med student , patch's antics at the school's hospital catch the attention of his soon to be arch-enemy , straight-laced dean walcott ( bob gunton )  
the dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school although he's one of the top students  
he writes in patch's academic file that he shows "" excessive happiness  "" 
i walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing  
there also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the early seventies  
then it struck me  
it must be based on a true story  
the movie is an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute , a free clinic  
robin williams is an amazing actor  
while he is adept at dramatic roles , his forte is over-the-top free spirits  
that's what makes his failure here so remarkable  
patch is exactly the character he should be best at , yet even the scene where he and another mental patient are battling fierce imaginary squirrels falls flat  
something holds him back  
most of the rest of the cast is two-dimensional  
for a film that champions seeing patients as human beings , it's curious that the ones here are cardboard characters  
peter coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like a real person  
unfortunately he's in the film for only about two minutes  
the audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene  
we're not left to our own emotional decisions : we're hit over the head with them  
shaved-headed children with cancer , an elderly woman whom patch makes laugh , a beautiful woman who can't love because of her abusive history  
when a group of students fix up an old house to use as a clinic in the andy hardy "" hey , let's put on a play ! 
we can use the barn and my mom can make the curtains ! "" 
mode , they laugh and roll around while painting each other  
there might as well be giant signs flashing : "" feel good now ! "" 
 "" feel bad now ! "" 
 "" patch "" is a good title for the film  
it is a patchwork of every manipulative scene you can think of  
the full-of-life student fights stodgy establishment types  
there's a touching death  
then there's another  
the film doesn't trust us to get it the first time  
the dean tries to kick patch out and later he tries again  
worst of all is the final courtroom bit  
scary-looking old men sit in judgment of a man who only wants to help people  
the room is packed with patch's supporters "

making a pact with malebolgia , a chief demon there , simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn , a general in hell's army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives , chains , and a morphing cape  
sullen , wise cogliostro and flatulating , wisecracking violator vy for spawn's attention  
comments : when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics ( where he had made a name for himself as a first-rate comic book penciller on the "" spider-man "" titles ) to join the newly-formed , creator-owned image comics , a new comic book legend was born : spawn  
mcfarlane's "" spawn "" immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s  
mcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate , allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max  
the early "" spawn "" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane's genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing  
with the popularity of "" spawn "" and the success of the current warner bros  's batman film franchise , a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn  
in the summer of 1997 , hence , new line cinema released spawn , a live-action film based on the groundbreaking series  
this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book , like me , numbed by how much spawn misses the mark  
what happened ? 
why is spawn so bad ? 
todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo  
i don't think , however , that his presence necessarily hurt ( or helped ) the film  
i place the blame , in part , on the recent hollywood trend , fueled by public demand apparently , for special effects blow-out movies utilizing the latest computer technology  
these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else : character , plot , dialogue , etc  spawn , reflecting this trend , shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics  
hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires , explosions , knives and chains appearing out of nowhere , glowing eyes , or constantly transforming demons  
a lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid , don't get me wrong , but , because the script and cast aren't engaging , spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper ( the surface may capture the eye , but nothing exists underneath )  
spawn's translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level  
mcfarlane's spawn was a tortured hero  
a mercenary by trade , al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda  
having died and journeyed to hell , he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda  
simmons , however , discovers that his memories are fragmented , his body a creepy mess , and his wife married  
despite his sometimes violent nature , readers couldn't help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld  
spawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so  
when the characters are developed , they seem absurd rather than touching  
the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot ( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat-16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world ) do not help matters  
spawn , in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman , also unwisely spends too much time on a villain , the violator ( batman favored the joker over batman )  
john leguizamo , like jack nicholson in batman , receives top billing in the cast as the violator ; michael jai white ( al simmons / spawn ) is second  
i ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator  
the film , however , spends so much time on the violator's offensive antics that they grate on the nerves  
apparently meant to be the comic relief in the film ( as nicholson was in batman ) , especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn , the violator's lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny , leaving the audience wishing he would leave  
leguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role , but he is seen far too often in the film  
michael jai white , a relative newcomer to theatrical releases , seems to be an appealing actor , and he handles his role adequately , but we see little of him without various masks on  
more time needed to be spent on white's character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings  
a special note should be made about martin sheen as the over-the-top , obnoxious , evil general wynn  
easily the hammiest performance in the movie , it's hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much ; after all , he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now  
sheen's excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film  
many other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down  
mtv-style , jerky , in-your-face editing is one of them  
flames , for example , roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting  
cogliostro , unlikely wannabe guide for spawn , serves as a poor narrator for the film  
he goofily tells the audience , at one point , that "" how much of [spawn's] humanity is left remains to be seen , "" as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another  
the music , finally , assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue  
loud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes  
to be fair , however , marilyn manson's "" long hard road out of hell "" effectively compliments spawn's return to earth , while filter and the crystal method's "" ( can't you ) trip like i do "" proves a surprisingly fitting theme song  
for as good a comic book as it is , "" spawn "" did not spawn a good movie  
spawn , instead , suffers from too much pomp and circumstance , and too little plot and character development  
it receives two stars for its technically well-done special effects  
many other films , though , have equal , if not superior , special effects and are much better  
rated pg-13 , spawn seems more violent than many r-rated movies and probably wouldn't be appropriate for the very young "

for the entirety of its running time , my eyes were attached to the screen , and i never once got bored  
i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it's entertaining to watch it in the same way that it's entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl  
as a narrative , the big hit is pure garbage , never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries  
it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank , which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways  
it's fine to mix genres , if the film makers know what they're doing  
unfortunately , writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don't seem to know how to handle the material , and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy  
the biggest problem with the amalgamation , in this case , is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place  
but it sure is a fascinating failure  
marky  
  
  
er , mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley , a hitman  
he's a good hitman , apparently , although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious ( he doesn't snipe or make clean kills--he just kicks the door down and shoots everything )  
he works with a few other hitmen--cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) , crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) , and vinnie ( antonio sabbato , jr  )  
they're a nice bunch of muscular guys , who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex  
they all work for a man named paris ( avery brooks ) , who is rich , powerful , and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen  
it is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own ; this , of course , is where the plot comes in  
they decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko ( china chow ) , who has a rich father  
when they do this , it turns out she is paris'  
  
  
goddaughter ! 
it's very bad to have paris against you  
the story is standard action film stuff  
it's nothing new , and nothing particularly offensive ( but certainly not the slightest bit compelling )  
clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it's a john woo-type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy  
it's true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face/off and the replacement killers , which are both far superior )  
there are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story  
they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns  
melvin is also very good at breakdancing , and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives  
like i said , it's not boring ; most disasters aren't  
what makes it so bad is its genre-shifting madness  
it seems to start out as a quirky-but-realistic action comedy , as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains  
then , as soon as they go to their first hit , it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere  
then , somewhere in between , it turns back into comedy  
keiko turns out to be a spunky little girl ; in one amusing scene , she is forced to read a letter out loud , indicating that she has been kidnapped , but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words  
and scenes like this work alone , but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious , or not be in the film at all  
one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped ; when cisco gets there , paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it , but they let him out of there , telling him to find the perpetrator  
the scene is played for laughs , but it isn't funny  
and since it doesn't quite work as a comedy , it tries to fall back on the action , which also fails  
this is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun  
cars land on tree branches and are supported by them  
characters betray each other without a second thought  
grenades are thrown in tight places  
people jump out of tall buildings and survive  
people outrun tumbling cars , and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds  
most frustrating of all , though , is the film's definition of a hit man : these guys are anything but subtle , quiet , and skilled individuals  
they're more like socially depraved militia men ( melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage , including missile launchers and hand-held machineguns )  
the characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest ; this obviously doesn't make for deep or interesting people to watch  
the acting is kind of fun , though--wahlberg is a good actor , and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way "
