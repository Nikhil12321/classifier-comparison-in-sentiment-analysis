scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do , as a larger-than-life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership : the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences , but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal

placed in minnesota and north dakota during the winter , many of the scenes take place outside with long scenes of snow-covered ground against a background of white  
just what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night  
as with most coen brothers films , this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes , each of which works out in the oddest way possible "
1,"three things i learned from "" being john malkovich "" : when getting on the elevator for your first day of work on the 7 1/2th floor of a building , always bring your crowbar ; don't stand in the way of your wife's actualization as a man ; and , whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being , wear old clothes , because , hey , it's muddy in there  
 "" being john malkovich "" is the most original film to come down the pike in a very long time  
wildly surrealistic , yet presented in a down-to-earth , funky style , this is the kind of movie that sticks in your head  
after savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline , you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it "
1,"albert brooks saves the day , just in the nick of time  
with a very poor summer for movies , brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up , and does so in a positive way  
while this may not be his finest work , "" the muse "" still shakes up some delightful humor  
in albert brook's latest comedy , he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter ( brooks ) who's losing his edge , as his business partners say "
1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction , the cinematic output from its creator , quentin tarantino , has been surprisingly low  
oh , he's been busy -- doing the talk show circuit , taking small roles in various films , overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn , making cameo appearances on television shows , providing a vignette for the ill-fated anthology four rooms -- everything , it seems , except direct another feature-length film "
1,"plot : during a 10-week span in london in the fall of 1888 , jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never uncovered , committed five ritualistic , grisly murders of prostitutes

1,"almost a full decade before steven spielberg's saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both "" anti war "" and "" pro-soldier "" , john irvin's hamburger hill proved it could  
lost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stone's platoon , this excellent film was dismissed as "" too militaristic ""  
it's hard to understand exactly why---unless irvin , in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable ( and often naive ) reasons "" chose to show up "" for the vietnam debacle , ---has refused to present us with the stone killer , drug-stoked psycho and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what "" the polack , the hillbilly and the kid from brooklyn "" became to wwii movies

1,"expand the final fifteen minutes of home alone into a feature-length film and you've got baby's day out--an agreeably amusing children's comedy about a bumbling band of kid kidnappers who are unwittingly outwitted by an innocent infant  
the plot tracks a trio of crooks-posed-as-photographers ( mantegna , pantoliano , haley ) who steal nine-month-old bennington august cottwell iv , aka baby bink , from his old-money home  
but the plan goes awry when baby crawls out an open window and into the streets of downtown chicago !

1,"your friends and neighbors is a rather bizarre film about 6 people , who hop in and out of bed with each other  
written and directed by neil labute , who's first film , "" in the company of men "" was simply marvelous , disappoints a bit here with this one  
the story involves two couples ( ben stiller & catherine keener and aaron eckhart & amy brenneman ) , an artist assistant ( nastassja kinski ) , and an egotistical women abuser ( jason patric )

1,"i had lost all faith in pg-13 movies that are intended for teenagers and adults  
the last dozen or so that i have seen have all felt incomplete , as if the most crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain a more lucrative rating  
however , after seeing the creative frequency last week and now the exciting u-571 , my bias is beginning to go away  
both films are as innocuous for younger viewers as they are intellectual for older viewers "
1,"shakespeare  you hardly understood it in high school  
why would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn't count on it ? 
if this is your attitude , then i'll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh's hamlet is probably not for you , and you might as well stop reading right now  
if , however , you are a lover of the bard , or at the very least are open-minded about a challenging script , read on , for there is something rotten in the state of denmark "
1,"after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project , making the third installment in the godfather-trilogy  
this new film has been underrated for no reason  
it is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla's pervious films  
it is also more psychological , pessimistic and more tragic than the first two "
1,"john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles  
so effortlessly that people tend to forget he's there , much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors ( anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor's face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors )  
example : the other day my mother asked me ( the expert , of course ) if there were any movies out worth seeing , never mind that our tastes couldn't be more divergent--- i'll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes , and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go ! 
was a lot of fun ( which it is ) , so i didn't see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation  
i muttered , with a little trepidation , that she might enjoy high fidelity "
1,"a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip-hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why today's youth seem attracted to black culture  
the review 
if black & white , the new film from writer/director james toback , is eventually remembered for only one thing , it will be the revelation that brooke shields , claudia schiffer , marla maples and mike tyson can act  
however , this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that  
black & white is a fascinating film ; it makes a statement about america's youth and hip-hop culture without getting heavy-handed overly serious "
1,"richard gere is not one of my favorite actors  
however , i like courtroom dramas , and this film looked good enough to take a chance on  
i wasn't disappointed  
it wasn't a great film , but it was interesting , and took several unexpected turns "
1,"virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre

1,"because the press screening of "" planet of the apes "" was one day past last issue's deadline , i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time , listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece  
the chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance , that the story was thin , that mark wahlberg's character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked  
to those people i would like to say ? what the hell did you expect ? 
this is a tim burton movie , boys and girls  
tim burton movies have great art direction and thin , clunky stories "
1,"the bond series is an island in the film world ; where else would we look forward to cliches , and all of the other things that occur in most of these films ? 
where else would pure escapism , a vulnerable hero , the "" talking villains , "" blatant product placement , predictable action sequences , and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a significant change ? 
i don't understand it myself , but that's what the bond series is based on  
for ( i think ) 18 films , we've mostly got the same thing over and over again , with some variation ( and a bit of change , most notably in the two dalton films )  
but even i , a king of cynicism , can't bitch about it  
and "" tomorrow never dies , "" the ( again , i think ) eighteenth bond film , and second brosnan bond film , is no exception "
1,"pulp fiction , quentin tarantino's anxiously awaited and superb follow-up to reservoir dogs , is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about , loved , and hated films of all-time  
in all fairness , it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it  
as if reservoir dogs wasn't perfect , tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction , a fast-paced , hard talking , roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way  
every major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor "
1,"with a team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresoft's square pictures , final fantasy , inspired by the top-selling game franchise , is visually awe-inspiring and groundbreaking  
no doubt , you have never seen anything like this film , and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved  
but why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story , wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting ? 
obviously , the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi  
everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail : individual threads in the fabric , individual strands of hair swaying , wrinkles and pimples on skin , incredible water effects "
1,"zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we don't understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film  
zero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he'd like to think so )  
however , he's a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are  
zero's accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a "" normal "" guy who does the business side of the job -- he's the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero's greatness as an investigator "
1,"recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantville-one from entertainment weekly , one from a newsgroup , and two from different online resources  
each review compared this film to the truman show  
why ? 
the only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television  
other than that , the two movies are completely different from each other "
1,"scarface , a remake of the 1932 film of the same name , is a very gripping and , as far as i know , a true-to-life story of how power and violence lead to corruption  
al pacino , as tony montana ( for whom the movie is named ) , also provides a brilliant performance as a cuban refugee who comes to america with less than nothing and becomes one of the most highly respected and feared drug lords in miami  
oliver stone also penned the screenplay in one of his earlier writing roles  
the film begins by disclosing the story of now fidel castro ordered thousands of cubans to set sail and head for the coasts of the united states "
1,"did you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually from this planet ? 
or if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extra-terrestrial ? 
i used to think that about my 7th grade english teacher , ms  carey  
but after seeing this movie , they may have confirmed my suspicions  
as the story goes , at any time , there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth "
1,"carry on matron is the last great carry-on film in my opinion  
made in 1972 , it still features most of the regulars of this genre  
sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit , kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting , head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac , hattie jacques re-takes her role as matron , and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr  goode "
1,"there is a striking scene early in "" city of angels , "" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise  
the camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black  
then the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up  
you see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch "
1,"losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing  
reacting to such a personal setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare  
while we all might feel the desire to blow someone's head off with a shotgun when they don't seem to grasp our point of view , actually threatening them with one is usually something we avoid  
this isn't the case with sam baily - john travolta's slightly askew average-joe persona in mad city "
1,"tbwp is probably the single most profitable film ever  
not surprising , considering its tiny us$100 , 000 budget , to date it has earned in excess of us$130 million  
that's a shocking 100 times profit ! 
rumours have it that a smart internet `marketing' ploy was so successful in gaining cult-like fanatics , by word of mouth coupled with strings of excellent reviews , the film just exploded in the box-office , raking in millions on its opening weekend

1,"maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it's not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month , because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker , broadcasted on abc on a monday night , starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth , respectively  
because it's not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why it's so great  
underneath the to-die-for cinematography , the brilliant acting , and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty , not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it , tell it in a certain original way  
it doesn't merely go from plot point to plot point "

who's on the up and up , who's the real bad guy and who's gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie

1,"trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of the semi-dramatic the commitments and the nearly slapstick a fish called wanda , the full monty is one film which delivered the depth of the former and the humour magnitude of the latter  
the film opens with a narrated documentary reel showing the improving economic and living standards of sheffield in the 60's , then cut to the harsh reality of the present  
sheffield has become some sort of a semi-slum with the only visible increase in anything was the amount of layoffs from steel-factories ; a once flourishing industry  
gaz ( carlyle ) spends most of his time in the worker's club , a sort of place where jobless people sit around to wait for job offers "
1,"there's a thin line between satire and controversy , and mike nichols ( the birdcage , wolf ) has directed a sharp and very honest look at a us presidential election  
based on the book written by "" anonymous "" ( actually former "" newsweek "" writer joe klein ) , john travolta plays governor jack stanton  
but he doesn't actually play stanton  
he plays bill clinton ; just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady and billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville ( although the credits will of course say otherwise ) "

1,"i have to admit that i disliked this film initially  
it certianly isn't for every taste , and it's sheer torture to sit through if you're in a restless mood

this was my second favorite movie of 1998 , and would have been a shoo-in for first in almost any other year "
1,"to me , nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film

1,"jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box-sets on the video shelves -- he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the well-off  
maybe it's a classic case of displacement : it's easier to see jarvis' own lyrics ( obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall ) as a fetishization of lowlife , rather than leigh's films  
but it's worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of working-class characters don't make for a guarantee of 'authenticity' , let alone a good film

however , the endless stream of "" the little mermaid "" wanna-be's is getting to me  
you know the spiel : a lame plot recycled from some well-known story , colorful , almost psychedelic animation , the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson , the comedic sidekick/sidekicks , the seemingly unattainable love interest , a few catchy songs , a few in-jokes for adults , and the occasional out of place warner-brothers-coyote-fall-off-the-cliff type joke "

in this delightfully frothy italian romantic comedy , after accidentally being left behind by a tour bus while on a family vacation with her cranky husband and two cynical teenagers , rosalba ( licia maglietta ) , an unhappy housewife from pescara , finds herself - and love - in venice  
for the first time in years , rosalba's on her own when she's abandoned at a highway rest area

in how to make an american quilt , the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse ( proof ) , we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality  
all the sorrows , joys , longings , sufferings , and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and , as their bittersweet memories are given expression , one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future  
motion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals ; how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative "
1,"the happy bastard's 30-second review 
notting hill 
a cute romantic comedy from the writer of the hit comedy four weddings and a funeral , notting hill stars julia roberts as anna scott , a very popular actress with a $15 million asking price for movies  
one day she wanders into a travel book store owned by a simple london resident ( played by hugh grant ) , and sparks somehow begin to fly  
sure , there are points of turmoil , such as putting up with grant's slightly disgusting ( but very hilarious ) roommate spike , anna's pesky ex-boyfriend ( alec baldwin in a humorous cameo ) , and , on top of all that , those damn press  
it's a fresh sort of complexity to see in a romantic comedy , very different from , say , a stubborn father or "" not the right time "" like as seen in usual flicks "

1,"you've probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi , but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over `keeping the faith'

as youngsters , brian finn , jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio  
while their friendship progressed , anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support , so neither would feel excluded "
1,"playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task : they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare's works  
they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare : i mean , really , who doesn't think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate , introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter ? 
stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare , and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare  
and , despite the difficulty of their task , they have succeeded  
shakespeare in love is one of the smartest , funniest , most touching films of the year "

1,"i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that didn't need a sequel

if disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game ( toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions , and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply ) , it didn't show , and as distributor and part-owner of the property , at least it had a piece of the action

review by matt pusateri 
few movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas' 1977 classic , star wars  
the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture

1,"with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the "" film noir "" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller's crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy )  
their latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film  
the main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn't quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who's wise to the world , but he doesn't really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax

1,"if there's one thing in common about all of hollywood's major studios , it's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more  
although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it's obvious there's no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater

he figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the film's once-married-but-now-estranged stars , gwen and eddie ( catherine zeta-jones , john cusack ) , they'll be so distracted that they won't remember they didn't see the movie or it wasn't what they expected  
 ( and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony critic/david manning quote scandal ! ) 
for help , he turns to gwen's personal assistant/sister ( julia roberts ) "

-1,"paul verhoeven , the dutch auteur who dragged his violent , sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film , has never been what i'd consider a thoughtful director ( though some of his films , notably starship troopers , have been lauded as artistic achievements ) , but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who's managed to , no matter what the budget , make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils  
starship troopers was essentially a b-monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange ( a great film that's nearly impossible to find on video , yet showgirls is everywhere ) , in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ; the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards ( who may actually be 45% silicone ) , in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage  
it's not a completely successful film , but as a failure it's certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining ) one

reviewed by jack choo 
rating : 
the movie starts with a rather se7en-ish opening sequence , rather cool and sets the mood for things to come  
the story propels the audience into a neo-reality ; somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird tinges of blue and red

-1,"the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits  
the rationale is sound , but in many cases of this and recent years , the sequel is a shoddy product that's exposed for the cash-milking vehicle it really is  
last year's speed 2 and scream 2 , as well as this year's species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory

-1,"it's a sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movie contained within it  
such is the case for the 1990 paul mayersberg film _the last samurai_  
though the blurb alludes to "" a jungle filled with political intrigue , uneasy alliances , and murderous enemies at every turn , "" the story of the movie is actually quite simple ( and prosaic ) : a middle-aged japanese businessman named endo ( played by john fujioka ) and his assistant , both of whom have samurai aspirations , travel to africa in search of his ancestor , who went to bring buddhism to africa  
he hires the services of down-at-the-heels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo ( the redoubtable lance henriksen ) and his girlfriend ( arabella holzbog ) , and travels to the camp of an arms-merchant-cum-safari-host- cum-islamic-missionary ( john saxon ) and his wife ( lisa eilbacher ) "

-1,"any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project , as a perfect murder illustrates  
frankly , dial m for murder is not one of the master director's greatest efforts , so there is ample room for improvement  
unfortunately , instead of updating the script , ironing out some of the faults , and speeding up the pace a little , a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder , leaving behind the nearly- unwatchable wreckage of a would-be '90s thriller

he couldn't , of course , top the success and fame of big action names like sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger , but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shoot'em up and beat'em up genre aficionados

the sixth installment in the horrible , worn out series is by far the worst to date  
unlike the other five chapters , children of the corn 666 is a confusing , brainless thriller that takes the psychological horror route rather than slasher horror , but either way , none of these movies are the least bit scary

for the entirety of its running time , my eyes were attached to the screen , and i never once got bored  
i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it's entertaining to watch it in the same way that it's entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl

 "" mission "" has some good ideas , but they get lost in the unbearably boring delivery , dime-a-dozen dialogue , and spate of good actors wasted in cardboard-cutout roles
