1,"i swear i have seen the edge before  
in fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film  
however , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot  
in doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker  
unfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film  
but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head  
one surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script  
action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence  
even horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all  
the river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s  
the intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day  
the edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall  
i must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes  
this is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world )  
if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely )  
the edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film  
but taking scream's lead , the edge makes fun of the genre's cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively )  
charles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him  
for once , we don't immediately care for the main character  
instead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness  
they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic  
charles' birthday is the same day , and he receives a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob  
as action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect  
soon , however , bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his "" personality  "" 
charles , bob , bob's assistant steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the previews , hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter  
down the plane goes , the pilot is killed , and the three are left to survive in the wilderness  
director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow , and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations  
he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film  
take , for instance , the entire man-hunting bear plot  
this has been done many times in films with different animals , and even bears  
but given the charles' intelligence , and bob's uncertainty , many of the cliches are given fresh twists  
even charles himself seems to have seen these action films before  
my favorite line of the film comes from charles : "" most people die in the wilderness because they didn't do the one thing that could save their life    
thinking  "" 
despite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything isn't as it seems anymore  
i have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise , so instead i will avoid it entirely  
the first two-thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along , and some of charles' survival techniques seem possible , even making fire from ice "
1,"sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to  
it's not the time or the distance , it's the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy  
yet somehow , the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story  
the wings of the dove fits the pattern  
kate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love  
merton , a newspaper writer , would like to marry kate  
but kate's "" job "" , if you will , is to be a member of the british upper class  
her father lost all of her family's money , but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man  
naturally , a newspaper writer's wages don't count as "" rich  "" 
kate leads him on , but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder , ultimately because he's not marriageable  
kate's american friend millie ( alison elliot ) stops in for a visit on her way to venice  
at a party , millie catches a glimpse of merton and likes what she sees  
kate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie , he might forget about her  
it appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup  
merton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it  
he is still in love with kate , and will accept no substitute  
the three of them , along with a fourth friend ( elizabeth mcgovern ) end up on holiday in venice together , where their interactions are quite complicated  
let's sum up : millie has fallen for merton  
merton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate  
kate loves him but can't marry him , so on the one hand she's trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy , but on the other hand she's jealous of them as a couple  
a clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick - dying , in fact  
at this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies  
millie will leave her money to merton , who will then be rich enough to marry kate  
she lets merton know of her schemes and , since it will help him win kate , he reluctantly agrees  
kate leaves venice so that the two m's can be alone together  
merton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her  
he's not sure he can separate the two  
kate finds that she's not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else  
the brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved  
without revealing the details , suffice it to say that the situation ends badly  
the title refers to the object of merton's vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament  
one is left with feelings of regret and despair  
what started as such a promising relationship was damaged by greed , anger , and jealousy  
an interesting thought struck me after the movie was over , and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of a film noir  
a couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after  
their involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other , and after a few things go wrong , the whole idea seems like an awful life-ruining mistake  
i wouldn't call the wings of the dove a film noir , but the comparison is interesting  
as i have acknowledged before , i am not a wonderful judge of acting , but i liked the performances from roache and elliot  
roache successfully conveyed his character's ambivalence toward millie : near the end , he hugs her , at first staring into space , as if he's thinking about his plan with kate , then giving that up to fully embrace millie "

1,"many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come , the new film by visionary director vincent ward  
most will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors  
but little do they know ( as i so plainly found out ) that this has quite a complex story to tell  
walking out of the theater , i could see the audience's disgust    
one member even had to be awakened after the film ended  
don't believe the previews that you see    
this is definitely not a film for everyone  
this is quite possibly one of the most adult-oriented films to come out in recent years  
kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline  
the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us  
it goes back and forth in time , as if it has no boundaries  
think of the film city of angels  
now add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision  
both films deal with the afterlife , but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office  
costing around $85 million to make , the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it's money back  
but due to it's story , i doubt it will  
for everyone who thought titanic's story was too simple and cliche , here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay , it may not have done nearly as well  
but don't get me wrong    
i hope the film does do well  
it's a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen  
i doubt most of us could have thought of this place , even in our own mind  
what dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals  
the only film that surpasses it is dark city  
full of rich , shocking colors , we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to  
but don't do that , because you'll end up going to hell  
what dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake  
chris "" christy "" nielsen ( robin williams ) is startled by the sudden jolt , but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat  
annie ( annabella sciorra ) spies chris , as well , and both eventually bond and get married  
annie is an artist , whose paintings are colorful , lush , and surrealistic  
chris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself  
they also have two children , marie ( jessica brooks ) and ian ( josh paddock )  
but one day , the two children are killed in a car crash , and it almost destroys annie  
she tries to commit suicide , but fails , and is then put in an institution "
1,"i want to correct what i wrote last year in my retrospective of david lean's war picture  
i still think that "" the bridge on the river kwai "" doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies  
and i think that "" 12 angry men "" , "" witness for the prosecution "" and "" paths of glory "" would have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of 1957  
but i can't deny the importance of "" the bridge on the river kwai "" - cinematically and in its contents  
the film is set in burma in 1943  
a batallion of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai  
but the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn't work as simple workmen  
struggling toughly , col  nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col  saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect  
afterwards col  nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge  
he considers it an opportunity to raise his men's morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese  
but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins )    
a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people  
they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge  
and the film doesn't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in "" paths of glory ""  
lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies  
this is also perceptible in the conversations between col  nicholson and col  saito  
in this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is presented as a somehow unpleasant person  
the audience is supposed to applaud col  nicholson's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not  
the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col  nicholson takes for his men  
 ( the plot by-passes these risks  ) 
that means , the picture isn't perfect  
but it has a lot of virtues as well  
 "" the bridge on the river kwai "" shows the "" madness "" of war and what it can produce in people's minds  
it shows how colonel nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics  
and lean's film is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests  
these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme )  
david lean's direction is really effective and atmospherically perfect  
his film is highly suspenseful , especially in its dramatic ( if not wholly plausible ) showdown  
the film is also well-photographed and has an apt score  
alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col "

1,"eyes wide shut isn't the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick's final film , but it is an impressive achievement ; a mesmerizing , haunting , adult psychodrama about marriage , fidelity and sex  
it's a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end , consistently exhibiting the auteur's trademark penchant for long , continuous takes , his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast ( indeed , eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot : kubrick , a renowned perfectionist , reportedly held his cast "" hostage "" on the set for nearly a year )  
in an uncharacteristic maneuver , kubrick cast two big-name stars in the lead roles , namely real-life husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman  
they play bill and alice harford , a volatile couple who , during the course of a couple nights , ponder the validity of the idea that a husband and a wife must be faithful to each other  
he is an m  d  , she's unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go to a fancy party  
at the affair , they are both propositioned and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else  
when they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman ( after smoking a dash of weed ) inquires whether her husband had sex with two models who approached him during the night  
he ( truthfully ) says that he did not and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with  
they proceed to argue until alice tells her spouse a lustful story : evidently some time ago , she had a thing for a young naval officer  
she admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night  
bill is jolted by alice's story and we anticipate his reaction , but at that moment he gets a phone call and has to go "" show his face "" at the house of a just-deceased patient  
this turns out to be the beginning of a long and eventful night on the town  
the daughter of the dead patient hits on him but he wisely turns her down  
he almost does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street  
then , through a series of coincidences , he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic ( and frankly , creepy ) orgy takes place , with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other  
erotic dread mounts as cruise ( who's not supposed to be there ) wonders the spacious halls watching the "" action "" until he is discovered to be an outsider  
much hoopla has been raised over the fact that warner bros  digitally edited the orgy scene  
with the help of a computer , they put in cloaked figures to block some of the actual sex acts ( they can still be seen , just not in all their glory ) in order to avoid the dreaded nc-17 rating  
european viewers will see the film as kubrick envisioned it  
roger ebert calls the american version the "" austin powers version , "" and many others have bashed the alterations  
i am of the potentially controversial opinion that the figures only supplement the scene's mystical atmosphere  
the first thing one notices about eyes wide shut is how it looks  
this is an artful , distinctively gorgeous production , shot in dark , moody hues and featuring some elaborate , beautiful scenery  
from the giant mansion used in the film's centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harford's apartment , this film is always a pleasure to look at  
to boot , a great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still  
at the core , behind the graphic , controversial content and unappealing mood , this is a good-natured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity  
it looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic  
it's something superficial and yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship  
at the end , it seems , bill's eyes are wide open to the special kind of love he and his wife have for each other , more meaningful than anything he could ever hope to find on the streets of new york  
kubrick elicits wonderful performances from both cruise and kidman  
tom is completely convincing as dr  harford , a man who seems guided solely by destiny , with no control of the course his life will take  
nicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her performance is stunningly effective : she's headed for an oscar nod  
the movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast , at the head of which is director-cum-thespian sidney pollock , enigmatic and articulate as harford's mysterious friend  
eyes wide shut is not perfect : the last hour could have used a slightly more scissor-happy editor and both cruise and kidman are too good- looking for me to believe that either would have a very strong temptation to philander  
still , this is an important work from a great director , and while it may not be on par with some of stanley kubrick's best it is a worthy final film , a complex exploration of jealousy and faithfulness "

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
it's startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth  
the lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast  
since then , though , disney's animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year's hercules successively proving less and less potent  
with the once seemingly-impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox's anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation , the little mermaid  
while the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top-notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music  
the film's storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince  
what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions  
from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric , she's resolutely smitten , and she's such a pure and endearing character that one can't help but invest their heart with her  
this simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture  
one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters  
this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams' much-heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities  
while it's understandable that animated features lacking the name-recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto's use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia's showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it's unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy  
do we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ? 
is the film's entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ? 
 ( i'm not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan  ) 
fortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , are impeccably cast  
chief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who voices the film's heroine ariel to perfection ; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor , and gorgeous singing voice , ms  benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film  
 ( she's the only reason i'd even consider catching flubber  ) 
similarly , samuel e  wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian , the weary guardian crab  
he easily milks his lovable character's comic moments for all they're worth , and his rendering of two of the little mermaid's big tunes -- "" under the sea "" and "" kiss the girl "" -- have become the stuff of legend  
pat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea-witch ursula , while kenneth mars' booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel's father , king triton  
in large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal , and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef ) , the little mermaid is impeccably cast  
of course , the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken ( music ) and howard ashman ( lyrics ) , who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr  ashman's untimely death  
not only are mr  menken's tunes unbearably catchy , but mr  ashman's charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film's storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character's dialogue , and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film  
mr  menken's score for the film is equally top-notch ; the sequence where eric ( voiced by christopher daniel barnes ) and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse-drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr  menken's fine score  
it appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso-styled "" under the sea "" as joyfully crooned by mr  wright , which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song -- indeed , one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re-release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune -- but my favourite is ms  benson's heartfelt rendition of the ballad "" part of your world "" , an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope ( wonderfully lyricized by mr  ashman ) which , accompanied by the film's most dazzlingly polished animation sequence , packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes  
during the song's reprise , which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in , the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking , and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history  
as of this writing , november 1997 has come to an end , as has disney's limited 17-day re-release of the little mermaid  
there's no question that the primary motivation for , if not the film's reissue itself , at least its timing , was to reinforce disney's dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox's costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture , anastasia "

1,"'contact' shows why jodie foster is one of our best actresses  
see contact with your family  
it is a movie for all ages  
--a review by stuart cracraft 
contact starring : jodie foster , matthew mcconaughey , john hurt director : robert zemeckis star 
after a predictable mit phillip morrison powers-of-10 zoom-out start ( which can be surprising to those not familiar with prof  morrison's work ) , contact picks up steam , gradually , building , by-the-end , an irresistable juggernaut and a very good movie that does not as is so often the case fall out-of-balance in terms of too much pandering to the technological "" geek "" side  
by the end , the audience is left with what good science fiction is supposed to do : evoke a sense of wonder about the universe and evoke questions in your mind about what's out there  
this movie does not let technology overshadow characterization and in this sense it is unusual amongst high-tech movies  
however , except for jodie foster ( elie arroway ) and john hurt ( s  r  
hadden ) , who are both actors of exceptional caliber , the supporting cast are not especially impressive  
hurt certainly has had better roles ( stephen ward in scandal )  
this one , as the multi-billionare hadden , does not do his acting skills justice  
this is clearly a foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation  
foster's radiance has never been more strong than in the scene where she finally meets the vegans on their terms  
early scenes take a long , long time to build up to this  
the movie's pacing is very good and subtle  
the panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo and ceti in new mexico and puerto rico are beautiful  
the politics of foster's character attempting to obtain funding for research at these places are trite and predictable however  
one of the most entertaining , but very short scenes , is when foster is confronted by rob lowe , during a cabinet-level presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation  
there were real sparks in this scene between foster and lowe and it would behoove them to consider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored  
it is the only scene in the movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between two characters  
everything else was very one-sided ( e  g  
foster )  
lowe can stand up to foster and it showed in that scene at the cabinet table  
the core scene of the movie is set on a surrealistic beach on a far-away world in the starsystem of vega  
it feels a lot like science fiction writer john varley's scenes in his book steel beach , where the female protagonists encounters an immensely superior intelligence , in one case a computer manufactured by mankind itself , and in foster's case , an illusion drawn from her memory  
in another sense , this immensely moving scene evokes gene roddenberry's star trek pilot the cage , later the menagerie , when jeffrey hunter and susan oliver have their memories manipulated to create new worlds in which they live and encounter aliens  
the concept is not new , by any sense , in the world of science fiction  
but the beach scene , which is the centerpiece of the film , as is the whole film , is driven by foster  
freed from her needs to direct by director zemecki , foster is able to let it all hang out in the characterization and the lead she provides to her supporting cast  
as the movie gains speed , foster's acting intensifies and the audience really does experience it with her  
it is certainly oscar-caliber acting , unquestionably  
the supporting cast does well and zemeckis throws in some humor with some president clinton cameos , cleverly manipulated , george stephanopolus-style , to seem very forrest gump  
in fact , zemeckis et  
al  
got in trouble for the usage of some of the footage seen in the movie , vis a vis clinton  
but the audience i attended this movie with just had some good chuckles at clinton's walk-ons  
the much-discussed tension between science and religion in this movie is not particularly insightful to those who have already gone through this course though it is helpful to those in the audience who have not "
1,"ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan ? 
you remember , he was the title character in that 70's sitcom , "" welcome back kotter  "" 
always trying to help out the sweathogs , frequently trying to dodge mr  woodman , ever wary of his wife's tuna casserole  
 "" so , "" you ask , "" where is he now ? "" 
mr  kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high-stakes poker  
that's right  
i'm not sure if it's his main source of income , but from what i've heard , the guy occasionally comes away with $20 , 000 at a time  
and there you were , thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off-broadway theater  
you silly goose  
well , gabe kaplan isn't in the movie rounders , nor is the film about the actor come gambler's life  
but rounders is about poker , and gabe plays poker , and i thought that was kind of a neat connection  
sorry about the segue , or lack thereof  
matt damon plays mike mcdermott , a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker  
he's been playing for a while , and more than being proficient , he has caught the bug  
he goes to all the underground games in new york city , knows the regulars , and knows how to win  
in the beginning of the film , he's built up a nice thirty grand nest egg , which he takes to the speakeasy-type gaming parlor where the big boys play  
mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb ( john malkovich ) , an oreo-munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia  
mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker , but instead he loses it all in a single hand  
months later , he's paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck  
when mike's best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students , he wants to pick up right were they left off , working as a team to part others with their betting cash  
although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student , jo ( gretchen mol ) , worm connives mike into playing once more , and mike , bitten again by the bug , slides down that slippery slope , risking his relationship , education , and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life  
to make a film about gambling , a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters  
this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth  
rounders , however , seems to go more for the latter than the former  
the card clubs mike and worm frequent aren't very glamorous at all  
there's a basement , a lodge with elk heads on the wall , a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots  
except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table  
the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it  
we're given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them  
matt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker  
ed norton's worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they're worth  
john turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments  
he's both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro's low-key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich's heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself  
martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike's law professors , abe petrovsky  
while landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one's self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending  
perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just didn't seem to have much presence on screen  
she's a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn't be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon's reactions instead  
a good thing about rounders is that it doesn't get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can't find time for humor  
the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales "
1,"the ultimate match up between good and evil , "" the untouchables "" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry  
based on the 1959 television show of the same title , "" the untouchables "" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script  
the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public  
elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order  
however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws  
the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes  
the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws  
the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl  
from this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard  
right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs  
this developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced  
i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone  
the film only gets better from this point  
with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats  
they walk in unison and they only look forward  
as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens  
holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films  
one that comes to mind is "" the matrix "" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world  
wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style , the similarities between these two are countless  
 "" the untouchables "" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film  
the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone's army  
each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others  
elliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film  
he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be  
however , as the film develops so does ness  
his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side  
he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends  
his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in  
sean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables  
malone acts as a mentor to ness  
he teaches him "" the chicago way "" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun  
connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed  
andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer  
as ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him  
charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone  
smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film  
the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen  
also very similar to "" the matrix , "" they are exciting and intense  
>from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed "

1,"on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with  
in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his "" giallo "" murder mysteries  
while it's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller  
the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book "" tenebrae ""  
with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems  
the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa  
he brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him  
the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension  
argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business  
tenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here  
it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play  
in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes  
needless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist  
many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork  
they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria  
instead , tenebrae's set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world  
and the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment  
so tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question  
still , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative  
some critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated  
by the way , if you don't want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs  
about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious  
we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal  
he is insane , apparently  
the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife  
he is finally revealed to us as this "" second killer "" in the film's bloody climax  
but argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively  
you see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house  
but thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway  
bad cutting puts the timing way out  
in other words , he's almost in two places at once  
during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring  
by the film's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant  
the injury ? 
he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! 
thus , the revelation of the "" hero "" as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled  
helpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along  
but there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least  
the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa's mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage  
tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies  
for instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike "

1,"jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation  
even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited , the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation  
this is , after all , the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction  
to say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood , since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio , desperado , four rooms , and from dusk 'til dawn  
he was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide  
 ( i'm willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him  ) 
tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films , but never took the director's helm  
nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more , tarantino returns with a film he can call his own  
the film opens up with an homage to the graduate , with jackie brown ( pam grier ) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her  
jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo , which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas  
this makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi ( samuel l  jackson ) who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico  
however , while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u  s  for ordell , jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus ( michael bowen ) and atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , who catch her not only with the money , but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs  
jackie didn't know they were in the package with the cash , but that's of no consequence to the authorities , who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted  
of course , dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish , ordell  
ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) to get jackie out of jail , but while max is immediately attracted to her , jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety , since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police  
sure enough , ordell shows up at jackie's apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good , but she "" borrows "" max's pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell  
instead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol's chamber to ordell's head , jackie proposes a deal  
since ordell wants to get his money out of mexico , jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more , but this time for a more substantial fee : fifteen percent of ordell's half million dollars  
with a gun in his face , how can ordell not agree ? 
by itself , this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film  
however , we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think  
jackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell , but she's also making a deal with the feds as well as with max  
the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham , but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around  
instead , it's actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today's movies  
at least this film has a little imagination  
most of the performances in jackie brown are above par  
pam grier , of whom i had never taken notice before , plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable  
samuel l  jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control  
robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy , trying to do his best   
never mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy's apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course  
he's just so down-to-earth , the nature of his job really doesn't occur to us , even when we're shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison , or when we see the tools of his trade  
in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara , a recently paroled friend of ordell's , and bridget fonda as melanie , one of the girls ordell keeps around town  
unfortunately , de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between , and then they are mostly clipped sentences  
in this film , he's not really de niro , but stereotypical de niro , uttering things like , "" little bit , "" and "" pretty much  "" 
fonda , on the other hand , plays the slightly spaced-out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness , such that even when she is annoying louis , we are taking her side "

1,"do film critics have morals ? 
are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow ? 
naturally we don't want to go into a film with any preconceived notions , which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish  
secondly , and along the same line , we can't prejudge a film because of it's stars , director , etc  the difference ? 
well , in the first one , we'd go into a film thinking it's going to be dumb or it's going to be good , and that would affect our viewing ( that movie sounds and looks dumb , so i'm not expecting much )  
on the second hand , we're simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal "" grudge "" against the film company ( it's made by disney ? 
oh , it's just a merchandising ploy then ) , the actors ( jim carrey's in it ? 
it's gonna stink ! ) , or the director ( who ? 
can't be that good )  
this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint  
make sense ? 
ok , but what about comparing ? 
isn't that kind of along the same lines ? 
when we compare a certain actor or director or even composer's credibility in one film to another they were involved in , is that really fair ? 
sure , in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more , but what about jackie brown , for example ? 
is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction , just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ? 
i think it is , and i'll tell you why  
a good critic should be able to view the film from the "" average joe ( or jane ) "" viewpoint , while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film  
sometimes that can be tough  
 "" the acting was superb , but i was bored "" or "" i loved it ! ! 
it was sooooo cheezy ! "" 
might be used to describe a film  
these are contradictions , and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique  
but which is more important ? 
and which is better ? 
an extremely well shot and acted film that is boring , or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ? 
getting back to the point , my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we're reflecting what the public wants to know anyway  
every average person out there who's interested in this film is likely to ask "" how does it compare to pulp fiction ? "" 
and so , as a critic , i'm already responsible to ask that same question  
jackie brown stars pam grier , the "" blaxploitation "" heroine from the 1970's , who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character  
tarantino's pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta's sudden revival in the movie industry , and with talks of an oscar nomination , the same is likely to happen for grier  
 ( we've made it thru comparison #1 ! ) jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction's samuel l  jackson and comparison #2 )  
ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara ( robert de niro ) , a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years , to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half- million dollars  
trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics , as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed  
naturally this proves an obstacle to ordell's plans and , not as friendly intended as we'd hope , he posts jackie's bail after she is put behind bars  
the thing is , ordell is in this for no one more than himself , and as we learn from his previous actions , he's willing to kill anyone who stands in the way  
jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze  
ordell won't think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she's always done , yet at the same time , a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided  
it comes down to a simple question : would jackie rather face ordell or prison ? 
what ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help : the law , ordell , or maybe just herself  
coming into play is another 70's veteran , robert forster as jackie's bail bondsmen max cherry  
max's obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system , and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance  
also involved is ordell's "" surfer girl "" girlfriend melanie ( bridget fonda ) , a ditzy sun- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand  
fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role , but there's nothing more to her , and therefore , she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters  
de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself  
de niro is a brilliant actor , but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn't need a de niro to play him  
compared to pulp fiction ( comparison #3 ) , the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable  
in pulp fiction , even the small , seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful , complete , and lifelike , whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn't have suffered much with a lesser talented cast , the exception being grier  
tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind , so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth  
sadly , grier too could have received a bit more attention , especially when the story is all about her newly-jarred perception of life  
jackson teams up with tarantino again , but the chemical reaction isn't as awesome as the first time  
jules was the rambling , bible-quoting hitman in pulp fiction , and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off  
and although jackson is really , really good in jackie brown , i don't think he's quite as irreplaceable  
in fact , maybe a new face would have been better  
jackson could've remained tarantino's jules , and a new guy could have become ordell , forever to remain so in our memories  
sadly , these characters are too much the same , except ordell just isn't as impressive , and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules "

1,"steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities , because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits , like jurassic park , and "" oscar "" -awarded critical triumphs like schindler's list  
however , in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories  
one of them is close encounters of the third kind , extremely popular and influential science-fiction spectacle  
unfortunately , it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars  
although both films have a lot in common ( ground-breaking special effects , brilliant score by john williams ) their future was different ; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon , and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow  
when spielberg began work on that project , he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit , jaws  
together with other young directors of his "" new hollywood "" generation , like kauffman , carpenter , hill and millius , he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s , when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment  
ironically , it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of "" blockubuster "" philosophy  
but in the mid 1970s , many things were different ; spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie  
although very personal , spielberg's screenplay was partly based on the book "" ufo experience "" by dr  j  allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2  
spielberg was not only inspired by the mythology , but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost , unmatched until the contemporary era of x-files and the roswell anniversary  
that was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo-related incidents as the element of the plot  
the story begins with one of such incidents - team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u  s  navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19  
such events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary ( richard dreyfuss ) , power company worker from muncie , indiana , who later becomes obsessed with his experience  
because of his obsession he loses his job , family and sanity , but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler ( melinda dillon ) , single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction  
in the meantime , the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u  s  government , in co-operation with the french , led by lacombe ( francois truffaut ) begin with the preparation for ultra-secret project  
when the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary , he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area  
there he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions  
two of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there  
spielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects  
the slow , gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents - "" close encounters "" - is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale  
but , instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws , we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder  
throughout the movie the viewer knows that something big , magnificent and wonderful is about to happen , and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end  
the last sequence , with its , even in this age , impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull , would leave many mouths open  
one of the great virtues of this film is its optimism  
aliens , who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in science-fiction cinema , are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is a beginning of something wonderful  
it is very ironic , when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story - howard hawks' thing and byron haskin's war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind  
spielberg's humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era ; the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post-watergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public  
but , even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chain-smoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to x-files and its more cynical and disturbing visions  
there lies the main , and probably the only flaw of this great picture - lack of conflict , and consequently , lack of drama  
the movie has few excitements or even action scenes ( especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock's north by northwest ) but generally , almost everyone - neary , jillian , government , aliens - are the good guys  
despite such shortcomings , the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles  
richard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary , yet nice guy , who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale "
1,"melvin van peebles' "" sweet sweetback's baadasssss song "" was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement  
it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident  
its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before  
in style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , "" sweet sweetback "" was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter  
van peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built "" sweet sweetback "" from the ground up almost entirely by himself  
because no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself  
the movie ended up costing about $500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby  
van peebles cut costs by hiring non-union labor and taking on most of the film's responsibilities himself  
he wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role  
he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck  
for instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases "" rated x by an all-white jury , "" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film  
he also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling  
the storyline in "" sweet sweetback "" is deceptively simple  
it takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex  
one day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they're bringing in suspects on a politically-charged case involving murder  
however , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu-mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously  
acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death  
the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico  
although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles' camera to roam the darker side of l  a  - the ghettos , alleys , and back-street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked  
van peebles' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored  
at the beginning of "" sweet sweetback , "" he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : "" sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality    "" 
van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration  
of course , with today's abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , "" sweet sweetback "" doesn't seem all that revolutionary  
it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made  
at that time , "" sweet sweetback "" was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it  
distributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles' words , gave the black audience "" a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass  "" 
of course , once it caught on , it caught on big  
 "" sweet sweetback "" is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates "" sweetback "" from other movies like "" shaft "" ( 1972 ) and "" the mack "" ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios  
 "" sweet sweetback "" is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers  
however , even if when viewed from an african-american perspective , "" sweet sweetback "" is certainly not without its controversies  
when it was first released , an article was published in "" ebony "" magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it  
there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of  
others have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives  
still others point to the clich ? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm  
nevertheless , a movie like "" sweet sweetback "" cannot be made without conflicting points of view "

1,"ladies and gentlemen , 1997's independence day is here ! 
it's title : starship troopers  
and surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4  
i realize that i gave last year's sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour  
after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn't as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review  
starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem  
as a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film  
in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film  
starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether  
while starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : "" the 'star wars' of the 90s  "" 
am i being to generous to this film ? 
perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races  
in essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction  
the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to  
starship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a "" kick-the-aliens'-asses "" style  
id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role  
this new "" star wars "" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs  an alien species  
the alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects  
however , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy  
sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization  
more than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends  
and they should be  
i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film  
this is an "" event "" film , but surprisingly above average  
it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved )  
starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange "" join the army "" ads  
mixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original  
stating , "" would you like to know more ? "" , 
these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously  
however , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way  
after witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw  
we are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards )  
rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms  
however , carmen isn't as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot  
however , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico  
unfortunately , rico isn't interested in dizzy  
this setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch  
carmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up  
and as a result , dizzy signs up  
everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry  
the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships "

1,"plot : a big-time momma's boy can't seem to leave his mother's crib and make good on the babies that he himself has produced in the world  
he visits his kids ( and their mommas ) every now and then , but his main goal in life is    well , he doesn't have any goals  
then one day , his mother gets an ex-gangsta boyfriend and suddenly he isn't as welcome anymore in his own house  
it isn't long after that , that his girlfriends start realizing what a jerk he really is and well    it's 
either time to grow up or bow down ! 
critique : first things first ! 
this movie ain't about the "" hood "" at all , it's an intelligent film about love , relationships , family , friendship , maturity and growing up  
do not avoid this film because you think it's about gangbangers and stuff , because it isn't at all  
it's about you , it's about me , it's about your girlfriend , your mother , your problems and your inability to face up to your responsibilities and to , well    grow 
up ! 
this is an extremely well-written film , with some of the most developed characters that i've seen on the screen all year , with superb acting performances to match  
granted , the film does start a little slow ( and go a little long ) , but hang in there , because once you appreciate and get to know all of its characters , you will be glad that you did  
this isn't a kid's movie  
this is about the step that you need to take in order to pass into full "" adulthood "" and some might not appreciate the grander theme behind that step  
i certainly did , because i too passed , and am passing , through many of these very same things right now ( yeah , yeah , i still live with my momma ! ! ) and related to a lot of the events that went down in this flick ( oh yeah , and for the record , i'm not black but that made absolutely zero difference in this case )  
but that's not even half the story  
you see , the film is damn funny , too    and 
i mean , damn funny ! 
i was crackin' up at almost every other scene , and they weren't "" set-up jokes "" like your typical comedies either , just day-to-day things that we could all relate to ( like the scene in which ving rhames is "" drinking koolaid "" in the kitchen and his infamously improvised "" african squat f * * k "" scene , which you just gotta see to believe ! ) 
and there are the performances , too  
ving rhames , now here's a man who has already established an early lead in the race for best supporting actor at the end of this year  
damn dude , you scared the shit outta me ! 
tyrese gibson , i have no idea where this guy came from ( an r&b singer and mtv vj , you say    hmmmm ? ) , but other than his uncanny resemblance to taye diggs , he nailed this part to the tee  
from scene one on , i was glued to his performance and sympathized with his character as he molded and shaped himself into the person that he hoped to become one day  
and everyone else , too  
gibson's girlfriend in the film , taraji henson , made me a backer with her many subtle touches , all of which helped raise her character several levels above the "" typical "" bitchie girlfriend that we've seen in many of these relationship movies  
but that's the thing that i liked the most about this movie  
everyone seemed real , the situations felt authentic , the characters all came across as people like you and me with issues and struggles and hopes and fears  
i liked this movie a lot because it was masterfully written , wonderfully acted and genuinely entertaining to watch  
and yeah , i even liked the whole homage to boyz 'n the hood that singleton pulled off in the end ( he called this movie a "" companion piece "" to that film )  
a very solid follow-up to an ever greater original , baby boy is a film to be seen by anyone who feels like they never wanna grow up  
note : the guy who plays jody's best friend in this movie is omar gooding , cuba gooding jr  's younger brother ( cuba starred in 1991's boyz 'n the hood ) "

1,"oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with ! 
in a perfect world , "" a civil action "" would be a breath of fresh air  
it's cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isn't  
it's romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham book/film isn't  
and , the capper , it has no distinct ending , and the law in hollywood films is that above all else , you must have an ending  
even if it's based on a true story , a true story which hasn't yet ended , you must supply an ending , a false one , but an ending nevertheless  
hell , "" a civil action "" is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together ( and that includes "" the firm , "" the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic )  
yet it's also oddly and slightly unsatisfying  
weird  
this is , in fact , a steve zallian film , not just the work of a hack , and zallian is the director of the much-admired "" search for bobby fischer "" ( didn't see it ) and writer of none other than "" schindler's list  "" 
in short , i like this guy , and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories  
after all , apart from the obvious it's-a-holocaust-film and it's-a-spielberg-film , isn't "" schindler's list "" just a damn brilliant film , not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study  
 "" a civil action "" is the same way : it's narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study  
and it's here that the film seems to go a bit wrong  
the main complaint of this film is that while , yes , it's an engrossing lawyerly tale , it has no real ending , and that's not necessarily the problem with the film  
it's that it's just kind of unsatisfying  
if this were a great film , it would feel complete , and still end basically the same way  
but this film just seems to end , and i don't want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on : imagine , if you will , being one of those the film is about , looking forward to this film , and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter , just so the many won't bitch about what is , essentially , genuine  
but the fact that it just ends is not , in all actuality , what is wrong with it  
it's rather that zallian has chosen , in the last half hour , to adandon the traditional lawyer story , and chose the other part of his story , the one about the lawyer , one jan schlictman ( john travolta ) , who's shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer , brilliant because he's manipulative and he always wins  
it wishes to make it all about jan in the end , but the truth is , his change , although nicely done , is not full  
we see him suffering from a personal crisis , and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart , but in the end , we don't fully believe it  
and i think that the problem is when he has made his decision , the film choses an odd angle to go at , a noble one , but one that gives the film's conclusion that of incompleteness  
in the opening of the film , we see him doing his old schtick , manipulating courts , winning cases effortlessly , and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases  
in short , he's full of bullshit and we know it  
in the film , he takes a case that is hardly desired : a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river  
point one , it's not of the usual criteria ( jan points out , wickedly , that dead or wounded children aren't nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success )  
point two , it has been through several lawyers  
after turning them down , jan changes his mind ( a muddled scene - he stops his car on a bridge , looks out    is he feeling a sense of overachievement ? ) , and he and his team of lawyers ( tony shalhoub , zeljko ivanek , and accountant william h  macy ) head out to the town to do battle with the town's company  
they spend millions of dollars examining the land , test the water , what have you ( this is where stephen fry , a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in "" wilde , "" pops up thanklessly ) , and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children , and then , unsuccessfully , the workers at the plant  
they also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company , the eccentric jerome facher , played by robert duvall ( more on him later on )  
as we progress , we get so involved in the way the story is being told , which is engulfing everything around it , including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople ( one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland , who lost her child , who begins to have a personal crisis )  
things begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half , as they are up against impossible odds : the judge ( john lithgow ) is not only a strickler , but a pal of facher ; the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify ; no concrete evidence is being found , depsite the money spent to find it ; and they are quickly running out of money  
as macy mortgages everything he can , including their homes and their office , he slowly loses his sanity ( his meatiest role since , oh , "" fargo "" ) , and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist  
in fact , the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par ( owen gleiberman , especially , criticized the film for not being overly-dramatic  "

1,"the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year  
we are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics , loved by the people , and make tons of money at the box office  
this year , the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic , the mummy  
i have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them  
that tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza  
in the mummy , the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o'connell  
he teams up with a curious , clumsy librarian named evelyn , played by rachel weisz , to find the mysterious city of the dead , hamunaptra  
evelyn loves egypt , and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable  
rick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle , and that's why she chose him to lead her there  
also tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn's brother , jonathan , played by john hannah ( sliding doors )  
now in hamunaptra , the three uncover "" the book of the dead  "" 
the curious evelyn unlocks the book , reads from it , and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep ( arnold vosloo ) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book  
along with imhotep arising from the dead , the ten curses of egypt become in full effect , launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra  
not only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him , he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt  
don't expect huge things out of the mummy , but just expect to have a good time  
this movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects , which may turn off some viewers  
on the other hand , this type of film is one of my favorites , but that's up to you to decide  
there is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though  
the state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world  
we are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert , swarms of beetles and locusts , and even creatures crawling under a human's skin  
these may have been in other movies before , but not like in the mummy  
as of now , the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year , but all this could change when star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country  
in the past , brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles  
when playing "" george "" in disney's george of the jungle , he was mainly not known by anyone  
i would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name , and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens  
in the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle  
although brendan fraser is great , rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast  
weisz really reminded me of a character from an old , horror film  
the way she acts , looked , and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time  
evelyn is probably the only character that was likable , considering that the other characters , like john hannah's , didn't get much personal attention  
in many films , when different genres are mixed , the mixing usually works , and i like it for the most part  
in the mummy though , not all of the mixing works  
there are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror , some with potential comedy , some with potential drama , and some with potential pure action , but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work  
the mummy could have gotten an "" a "" rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these  
i didn't mind the corny one-liners here and there during action sequences , but it certainly could have done without them  
the cinematography is amazing in the mummy  
particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt , we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt , mummies , and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians  
the costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography  
from ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits , the costumes are always top notch "

1,"vampire films , as well as other horror films , are usually dumb and predictable b-movies , meant to scare us by cliches and simple shocks  
it is therefore interesting to watch neil jordans recent film that is not only visually stunning , but has also a plot worth making movies about  
based on anne rice's novel , "" interview with a vampire "" is a long , dark trip to hell  
the film opens with gothic quire and dark streets of present-day san francisco  
the camera slowly find particular window  
a shape of a young man is visible in the darkness  
 "" so you want me to tell you the story of my life ? ""  
the mysterious man is louis ( brad pitt ) , a two-century old vampire , telling his story to a fascinated interviewer ( christian slater )  
his tale opens in 1791 louisiana , just south of new orleans , where louis falls victim to the vampire lestat ( tom cruise )  
given a choice between death and eternal life as one of the undead , louis chooses the latter , a decision he will forever regret  
everlasting life and eternal youth , promised to him by lestat , turn instead into never ending suffering , damned to eternal hunger for blood and longing for peace  
louis cannot kill with the impunity of lestat , but , to sate his hunger , he must feed , and the blood of animals is not enough  
eventually , he pierces the neck of a grief-stricken young girl named claudia ( kirsten dunst ) , whom lestat then curses with his unholy form of resurrection so that she can be a surrogate daughter to both himself and louis  
for a while , they are one "" big , happy family  "" 
but all things end , and claudia's growing resentment of lestat fuels a bloody confrontation  
when luis and claudia break loose from lestat , they travel to paris , where the euro-vamps santiago ( stephen rea ) and armand ( antonio banderas ) , who introduced them to a bigger world of the damned  
director neil jordan ( "" the crying game "" ) together with the talented director of cinematography philippe rousselot and composer elliot goldenthal has created an incredible atmosphere  
as the film begins , there is an incredible palette of colors , beautiful sunrises , lush golden fields , green forests , inky-blue clouds and blending sun  
when luis is "" born to darkness "" , everything suddenly changes to dark velvet , lit only by the silver moonlight  
the beautiful production design by dante ferretti , wonderful costumes and art direction by malcolm middleton re-create the multiple historical periods in the film  
from the renaissance new orleans and the beautiful rococo paris of the 18th century , to our present days  
the casting is likewise good , involving some of the most famous and beautiful stars of hollywood , ireland and spain  
the controversial casting of tom cruise as lestat is incredibly effective  
cruise is energetic , sinister , charismatic , wild and bloodthirsty  
cruise's lestat likes to seduce young women before exacting his dark red sustenance  
with alarming swiftness , the victims switch from sexual excitement to outright horror , as his murderous purpose becomes clear  
 ""    kill them mercifully , but do it  
you are what you are   for 
do not doubt , you are a killer ! "" 
that is how lestat is teaching luis  
but behind that furious facade is anger and loneliness that he carries through the centuries and tries to smother with nightly rampages  
brad pitt is equally convincing as the "" vampire with a human soul ""  
antonio banderas and stephen rea are effective , but since they play more or less secondary characters , their performances are almost invisible  
the greatest performance in the film comes suprisingly from the young kristen dunst , who manages to create an incredibly emotional and believable character  
the world is changing around the little child , but she does not

1,"seen july 8 , 1998 at the crossgates cinema 18 , ( albany , ny ) , theater #7 , at 8 : 15 p  m  with my mom using hoyts cinema cash  
[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats] 
it's very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic , vivid sense of reality and life  
all stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters' lives , but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do  
therefore , "" gone with the wind "" deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does , in such a crafted , intricate , and entertaining manner  
it's a crowning achievement , not only in filmmaking , but for storytelling itself  
the film takes place in georgia before , during , and after the civil war  
this plays a major factor in the film's success  
to use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy  
it might also seem cliche , boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers  
can a story set so long ago be relatable now ? 
the film confronts all these problems , paradoxically , by not cronfronting them  
it doesn't simply plug in the "" right thing "" at the "" right time , "" it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant  
building a strong foundation is important to all forms of media , without which , what is there to build on ? 
we're given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters , especially our main character , scarlett o'hara ( leigh ) , a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel , a cunning wit , and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time  
she knows how her society works , wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her  
right from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be  
being the most sought-after woman allows her to manipulate men ( and their women ) to ensure she gets her way , whether it be obvious ( i  e  
who will be the one to get her food ) , or subtle ( i  e  
getting married just to spite someone )  
the man she claims to love is ashley wilkes ( howard ) , a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him  
he isn't so arrogant and demanding as scarlett , in fact , he's engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his  
her name is melanie ( de havilland ) , and she is one of the sweetest , kindest , and most likable characters one will ever see  
she and scarlett become very dear friends , but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her , and the love she has for her husband  
her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic - it defines who she is , but doesn't give her much emotional self-defense  
acting a catalyst to the love triangle , and to the story as a whole is the daper , stong-willed , cunning , cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler ( gable )  
he's quite a character all right - everyone listens to what he has to say even though he's got a bad reputation  
butler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior  
he tells everyone the much-needed truth in the rigid caste-like society where freewill doesn't seem to exist , everything is done out of honor and tradition  
for example , in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there's no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out  
this angers them , not for his lack of faith , but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that  
 "" do we have ammunition factories ? 
do we have food ? 
do we have a navy ? 
all we have is tobacco  "" 
all true statements and yet the south still insists he's wrong  
butler is a shifty character to be sure , but he takes such pride in his arrogance it's appealing  
scarlett notices this too when she first sees him , and from the look butler gives her , we know he's not going to stop until he has her  
but scarlett can't get past her need for ashley , and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story , butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever  
and so the story goes on , with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life  
the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband , especially after she is "" marked "" for life when her first husband dies "

like the children it portrays , the movie starts from the dark realms of awful cinema and works its way up to a show-stopping performance at the legendary concert hall  
roberta guaspari ( academy award winner meryl streep ) has two kids , a husband who left her and 50 violins she bought from a small shop in the mediterranean  
her life desperately needs a jump start and gets one when she meets a man who introduces her to a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementary school  
she soon finds her job is on the rocks as the men in her life continue to rotate through revolving doors  
that is the pattern-like plot of this production  
ultimately , the film chooses a zero-sum answer to these problems and finds her music career at an all-time high when the men in her life finally vanish  
the first hour of music of the heart is rather painful  
roberta's character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat  
also lacking depth is the film's "" bad guy , "" a narrow-minded music teacher ( josh pais ) who rejects roberta out of principle ( the movie never explains exactly which principle that is ) and conveniently comes and goes from the plot according to when it might be dramatic to have a villain around  
the next 15 minutes of the film are mediocre  
they are highlighted by one child's return to roberta's class ( coming after the great old hollywood scene where he explains be can't be around anymore because "" my mom said    "" ) and a glowing concert  
not knowing the running time , you may expect the credits to role at this point  
but they don't  
instead the film uses the next 45 minutes to finish its journey from bad to mediocre to excellent  
director wes craven , known for his works of horror , uses some old sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing  
one romantic break up scene is highlighted by the classic "" but    
last night    "" 
and roberta's two children also have textbook conflicts with their single mother regarding their father's absence  
the city of harlem plays a strong role in the movie  
roberta's mother is initially reluctant to see her daughter move to that part of town and the film does nothing to combat that stereotype  
the noise tracks for these scenes are dominated by sirens ; predictably one of roberta's students is gunned down and killed off screen  
one thing the film does lack is subtlety  
the fact that a little boy was playing "" we shall overcome "" on his violin after the aforementioned shooting was a cute and discreet reference  
the fact that the entire orchestra begins to play it over and over soon after is an overdone reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience  
 ( of course , in horror films the foreshadowing and between-the-line moments are meant to be overdone , so perhaps he too is just learning to play the game "
1,"many people dislike french films for their lack of closure  
while possibly shallow , i've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view  
there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil )  
stephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker  
he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing  
even the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches  
in the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man  
camille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes  
maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife  
like stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges  
when stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals  
however , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him  
stephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present  
as the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another  
these two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently  
stephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship  
however , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation  
the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher  
however , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing  
consequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays  
in contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier  
however , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world's finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing  
during the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions  
stephane attempts to remain unchanged  
however , we do see subtle hints of his transformation  
one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash  
the development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible  
american movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development  
in its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane  
the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille's and stepahne's characters  
i am not sure why berardinelli says , "" at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil's credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty  "" 
this movie is not about judging stephane's actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are  
i find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling  
this portion of the film is where the "" sense of closure "" could have been successfully accomplished  
unfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters  
while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film  
the synergism of the tension of ravel's music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen  
the directing in this movie is wonderful  
the actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth "
1,"here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop  
okay , it isn't quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart  
most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them  
however , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered  
a lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash  
but , the thing is , it isn't  
it's well made , well acted , and quite intelligent  
i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film  
but the species series isn't about the lack of these elements  
it's about how much it can get into one film  
and yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so  
species ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe  
many films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film's needs  
species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars  
aboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut  
patrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed  
well , it would seem that he has succeeded  
landing on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so  
of course , he isn't the first ever  
about a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life  
now , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky  
no life lives on it  
that is , no visible life  
patrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground  
he takes them aboard , and puts them in storage  
unfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship  
just prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings  
they pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can't even remember  
they blame it on a technical malfunction  
back on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible  
as we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet  
however , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is  
patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge )  
eve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien  
however , this time around , most of her "" alien "" urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant  
the project is led by dr  laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable  
since she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again

1,"ok , let's get one thing straight right away : maximum risk is no battleship potemkin ( although it does have some russians in it ! ) , but it's not too bad , really  
it's the new film from ringo lam , the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood , and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium , jean-claude van damme ( who , you will recall , also starred in john woo's maiden hollywood effort , hard target )  
in lam's film , van damme plays alain moreau , a french cop ( at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target ) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians  
these russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york ( where , i suppose , they thought they wouldn't be noticed )  
this brother , mikhail suverov ( played in his few scenes by    well , 
you know ) , becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi ( almost the same thing , i guess ) , and is killed in france ( in the movie , things happen so fast that you don't have too much time to think about how weird this all is )  
moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed , and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed ( we wonder the same thing ; i still do )  
in little odessa , he meets mikhail's girlfriend , alex ( natasha henstridge , last seen in species ) , who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise-en-scene ( she has very nice breasts , and we get to seen them briefly in this movie ; it was rated r in the us but is pg here , so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do )  
this film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow , the fugitive , hard target , or anything starring arnold , but that works to its benefit , i think  
after all , one thing that's been missing from woo's hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love ( well , some of us do )  
movies like this shouldn't be too pretentious , and that is part of the problem with some of these other films : they try to be too "" big "" in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle  
maximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions , but they don't overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative ( not too much , anyway )  
the emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions ( even if , at times , they don't make a hell of a lot of sense )  
in fact , one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character , a rather overeager new york cabbie ( frank van keeken from tv's "" kids in the hall "" ) , who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story  
unfortunately , by the time we have come to really get interested in him , he    well , 
you'll see  
the movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots  
one is a fight in a russian sauna , with lots of sweaty , muscular male flesh ( this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others ) , bullets in heads , and vodka  
another , my personal favorite , is a fight in a meat packing house , featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw  
and even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood , as they trash those quaint french cafes , vegetable carts , and , well , french people that , we all know in our hearts , deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint  
of course , the movie does have its share of silliness  
for example , while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he's getting , alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head  
in an unnecessarily dramatic moment , he apparently is shocked at what he sees , at what he has become  
but what has he become ? 
a tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him ? 
doesn't sound too unreasonable to me , considering the genre  
but let's face it , any time van damme tries to be dramatic , he looks silly  
so maximum risk is a little different from most other action films  
while watching it , i was surprised , and a little disappointed , in the relative lack of pyrotechnics  
but watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush ; after the initial excitement , there's not much left  
although it's short on spectacle , lam's film leaves a better and more lasting impression , i think  
i'm more impressed by it now than i was while watching it , and to me , that's a good sign  
go see maximum risk , but don't expect a typical hollywood action movie ; expect a sort of funky hong kong-hollywood action movie  
the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast  
 * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 
 * * * pretty good , bring a friend  
 * * * * amazing , potent stuff  
 * * * * * perfection "

1,"originally entitled dancing about architecture ( i  e  
 "" talking about love is like dancing about architecture "" ) , but changed because it sounded too much like the recent box-office dud dancing at lughnasa , this film slaps together a stunning cast of hollywood names , playing interesting and well-written characters , within a vignettes-styled plot arrangement a la robert altman  
plot : follow the lives of several couples falling in and out of love , finding themselves , regaining a clearer understanding of the people that they are , and who they want , and appreciating the fine emotional art of love  
critique : charmingly effective romantic drama , this film offers insight into various types of relationships , presents us with interesting characters and excellent performances from the cast , and scratches beneath the surface of love and its many complex subtleties  
how do people fall in love ? 
why do people fall out of love ? 
how do people fall back into love , once they've been hurt and left to join the lonely hearts club ? 
all of these questions and more , are touched upon in this film , within several types of variant relationships  
meet a hip , young couple going through their first date  
a divorcee attempting to date again after her many failed relationships  
a married woman "" finding herself "" while cheating on her husband  
a husband letting go of his inhibitions  
an older couple dealing with a past "" love "" of the man , a secret recently uncovered  
a son dying from aids , joined by his mother at the hospital  
there are many nuances to this picture , and many ideas and quotes to which we could all relate , but more importantly , there is diversity  
diversity of relationships helped me and my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels  
some related to the younger couples' issues  
others with the married  
there's a little bit of everything for everyone in here  
and i would bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch this film again in a year , i would relate myself to yet another predicament  
just like love itself , this movie is distinct and appreciated by all on many different levels  
the actors in this film are all also very , very good  
sean connery is solid as the older man with some issues to resolve , as is gena rowlands , as the aging wife with trepidations  
jolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance , while philippe is as pretty-boy as ever  
anderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to re-ignite her love life , opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by former talk-show host , jon stewart  
even dennis quaid manages to step outside of his overacting shoes in this film , and offers a convincing show of a man lost within his own imagination  
the only piece of this puzzle which left me somewhat detached , was the part surrounding jay mohr , the man dying from aids , and his mother , ellen burstyn  
the actors were fine , but somehow , the piece seemed out of place within the realm of everything else  
the ending of this film was also a little too saccharine for me , but i guess that's just hollywood  
this film is actually a lot like your friends and neigbors ( 5  5/10 ) and happiness ( 4  5/10 ) in concept and style , but its complete anthesis in regards to character relatibility and likeness  
the characters in those films were too unique and inhuman for anyone to care , as opposed to this film , which offers rich and believable characters , living real lives and talking about real issues in today's relationships  
all in all , this movie offers many interesting characters , talking and living genuine and engaging love lives , wonderful performances by its solid cast , too sweet of an ending , but an enjoyable and rewatchable movie nonetheless  
little known facts about this film and its stars : according to a story in the london sunday mirror , sean connery asked for only $60 , 000 for his role in this movie , as compared to his usual fee of $14 million , because he liked the script so much  
on top of that , he convinced his co-stars ( including gena rowlands , gillian anderson , ellen burstyn , et al  ) to do the same  
this is director/writer willard carroll second real foray into the world of "" adult films ""  
before this , he had written and produced many children's movies  
gillian anderson stands 5'2  
angelina jolie's full name is angelina jolie voight "

1,"capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg  
joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs  
it lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure  
the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious  
i had a good time  
 , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
here goes my credibility  
this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority  
i liked the third jurassic park film  
i even liked the second jurassic park film  
in a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton's novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle's novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle  
jp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , "" for the boy who's half man or the man who's half boy  "" 
that is what all the jurassic park films are  
expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house  
the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon's mines had under-written characters also  
jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs  
the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting  
some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds  
that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require  
i feel i got my money's worth  
the story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica  
this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park  
they hope , no doubt , to get a look at the island's dinosaurs from a safe height  
the height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not  
the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended  
flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide  
he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs  
but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go  
doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h  macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs  
they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn  
he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once  
right  
guess what happens next ? 
jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2  
first it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm  
sattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first  
curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance  
one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time  
they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films  
of course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species "

1,"some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese's raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the '80s  
since there are still a number of '80s films that i haven't seen , i don't feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i'll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level  
bio-pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry , dull textbook account  
it's rare that a movie with the moniker "" based on the life of ? "" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining  
raging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre  
the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the '40s and '50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen  
for all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying  
historically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion's share of the details culled from la motta's own autobiography ( which was co-written with joseph carter and peter savage )  
however , although la motta is credited as the movie's "" consultant , "" he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout  
the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ? paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage  
sex and violence are inextricably linked  
the title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull  
in the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them  
outside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled  
the two people who spar with him on life's canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother/manager , joey ( joe pesci )  
these are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses  
he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence  
raging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up-and-coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class  
over the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch-rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match  
meanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15-year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife  
vicki becomes jake's greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain  
his own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him  
hence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ? perhaps even his brother  
 ( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : "" are you f * * king my wife ? ? ? "" ) 
in the late '40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall  
he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing  
two years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray  
by the late '50s and early '60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ? a broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine  
raging bull is the other side of rocky  
sylvester stallone's tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976  
it won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production  
but , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring  
while scorsese's primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man , he never backs away from showing the seedy , ugly underside of a sport where gambling , greed , and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working  
rocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased  
there's little i can say here that hasn't already said about de niro's performance  
in a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding  
the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering  
and , although there's a lot of travis bickle ( de niro's character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him  
this is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting  
as the younger jake , de niro is trim and fit "

1,"nosferatu the vampyre ( germany 1979 ) 
a film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson 
this extraordinary re-telling of bram stoker's "" dracula "" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore  
inspired by f  w  murnau's 1922 silent film of the same name , herzog's film is a work of exquisite bleakness , an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards  
the original full-length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u  s  distributor anchor bay entertainment , and in gorgeous widescreen prints  
until now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video , and only in europe  
both of these re-releases restore the film to its full length , but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue  
apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent , and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed  
the german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one  
everyone knows the story of dracula  
or do they ? 
his story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly won't hurt  
jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count ( played by klaus kinski ) who wants to buy a house in harker's hometown  
upon seeing a photo of harker's wife ( the radiant isabelle adjani ) he instantly falls in love with her  
locking harker up in his castle , he sets off on a long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him  
upon divining his identity as a vampire , adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises  
that is a story familiar to millions , but herzog has elevated stoker's tale into the realm of - and i use this term a tad reluctantly - cinematic art  
nosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film , shot through blue-ish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised  
the film's surreal , dream-like quality is utterly mesmerising  
there is much to enjoy , but i'll limit my praise to a few key points  
holding the film together is kinski's remarkable performance as count dracula  
past screen portrayals , including bela lugosi's famous turn , have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp  
but kinski    oh boy , this is something far more compelling  
aided by a startling make-up job , he portrays dracula's vampirism not simply as pure evil but as some sort of loathsome disease  
this man is dreadfully lonely  
he lives in utter solitude , shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust  
kinski's portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting  
when he dies , you almost feel as if this man's tortured soul has been freed at last  
then there's the unforgettable soundtrack , largely composed by german group popul vuh  
it is so eerily beautiful and evocative that it's quite impossible to imagine the film without it  
popul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancient-sounding kind of spacemusic using piano , chants , and exotic instruments  
when i first saw this film some years ago i was so impressed i tracked down and bought a number of their albums  
the one i still listen to the most is "" tantric songs "" , from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken  
it's a testament to the music's depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is with them

my family , for the most part , hates him and his movies  
i think he's very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years  
so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of  
unrestrained by physical boundaries , allen's humor comes shining through  
those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen's intelligent observations of life  
those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one  
in 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they'd never seen before  
toy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present  
many critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture  
antz , however , has upped the ante considerably  
disney's a bug's life isn't due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal  
by beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience's thirst for computer-animated films  
but don't let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared  
in the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios  
in 1997 , it was the volcano duel  
in my opinion , dante's peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality  
volcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations  
in 1998 , there are twice as many competing films  
first was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it's cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact  
but now , it's even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks )  
who will prevail ? 
time will tell , but i'm sure that mr  mouse has nothing to fear  
this may sound like i didn't like antz ; on the contrary , i'd put it up there with toy story  
but due to it's pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn't appear in disney's version  
some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film  
sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd  
the humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended  
this is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents  
antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen's shtick and franz kafka's metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug  
z ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker  
 "" when you're the middle child in a family of five million    "" he comments about his neglected childhood  
one night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life  
in walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown  
bala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader  
after discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there's a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony "

1,"deep rising is one of "" those "" movies  
the kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us  
it does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god    screw that , it says boldly , let's see some computer generated monsters rip into , decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors  
heh ! 
them wacky monsters , gotta love 'em  
of course , since we can rent about a thousand b movies with the same kind of story , hollywood must give that little extra "" oumph "" to get people in theaters  
that is where deep rising fails , which is a good thing  
confused ? 
let me explain : 
despite all them flashy effects and big explosions , deep rising is still , at heart , a good 'ol b movie  
luckily , it's a very good b movie  
the worst cliches in movie history are a b movie's bread and butter  
therefore , things that would destroy a serious movie actually help us have a good time while watching a movie of lower calibre  
of course we know there's a big slimy creature behind that door , that one person will wander off to be picked off by said monster and we always know which persons or person will make it out alive  
we just don't know when or how horrible it will be  
i went to see deep rising with my expections low and my tolerance for bad dialogue high  
imagine my surprise when i discover that deep rising is actually , well , pretty darn funny at times  
a funny b movie ? 
well , that's new  
these flicks are not supposed to make us laugh  
 ( except for a few unintended laughs once a while  ) 
and before you know it , treat williams , wes studi and famke jansen appear on the big screen  
hey ! i know them guys ( and gal ) from a couple of other movies  
cool  
familiar faces  
so far so good  
our man treat is the hero , he'll live  
wes is a staple of b movies , he is the token victim  
we know he'll buy the farm but he will take a few creeps with him on the way out  
famke is the babe , 'nuff said  
there is also a guy with glasses ( the guy with glasses always dies ) a black person ( b movie buffs know that the black guy always dies , never fails ) and a very funny , nerdy guy  
 ( ah ! 
comic relief  
how can we possibly explain having to kill him    let 
him live  ) 
after the first fifteen minutes i felt right at home  
i know who to root for and who i need to boo too and a gum to chew  
 ( please kill me  ) 
suffice it to say that for the next hour and a half i jumped out of my seat a few times , went "" ewwww "" about a dozen times and nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing "
1,"with the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up , loading their guns , kissing each other and uttering what sounds like "" rock and roll ! "" 
 ( actually , it's "" lock and load "" ) , you can't help thinking tarantino  
and of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery , the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie & clyde to natural born killers  
but if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction , exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run , normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon  
 "" inspired by true events "" -- we've heard that one before , and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated    
or so strangely poignant  
for this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality , who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged  
beginning with their final arrest , the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris ( luke perry ) , a policeman , and pam ( ashley judd ) , a factory worker  
they fall in love and marry , but pam's increasingly erratic behaviour ( going on spending sprees , slashing herself with a knife after an argument ) begin to trouble the solid and stable chris  
when chris gets sacked , they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up  
then , chris begins to rob banks    
luke perry accomplishes the not-inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer  
moustached , with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation , he is perfectly cast as the long-suffering husband  
 ( it's another of john mcnaughton's coups of casting-against-type , after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory )  
but it is the character of pam who commands centrestage , and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness , making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person  
if the performance falls short of greatness , however , it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema , whether it's in betty blue , tom & viv or georgia  
as in those movies , there's the danger that the performance seems mannered , a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece  
judd doesn't entirely avoid this pitfall , but pam's 'craziness' is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more 'normal' chris  
when pam reacts to her father-in-law's death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones , chris' face is the picture of pained restraint  
of course , it's the question of what is 'normal' that is asked in normal life  
mcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity  
it is the rational chris that loves guns ( "" shooting is about precision , control "" ) and the 'crazy' pam that loves astronomy and yearns for a dog ( who is then called chaos -- "" chaos and you and me    
we're a real family "" , she notes wryly )  
it is chris' methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber ( his well-planned disguise as a bearded , roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness )  
in the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery , a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background : "" buy-more "" -- the perfectly respectable consumption-crazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases , and both of them into desperate situations  
it's not a perfect film  
some of the dialogue is a touch too banal ( perhaps intentionally ? )  
the use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pam's crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film  
indeed , as in mcnaughton's seminal film henry : portrait of a serial killer , it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism , the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre , that gives this determinedly unflashy , moving film its great strengths  
mcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet , coolly 'realistic' method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer  
the suburbs , with their miles of white-fenced houses and identikit malls , take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness  
in its very different way , this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malick's badlands  
while pam shares the yearnings of malick's heroes to escape from ordinary life , chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a 'normal life' - their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies  
but these are dreams defined by , constrained by , and even doomed by , the limitations of the 'normal' , conventional world "

1,"making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed , especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece  
when it comes to living up to expectations , a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure  
for a sequel to live up to or even surpass the original's greatness is very rare indeed  
and whereas "" babe : pig in the city "" misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe , it is a worthy companion piece  
more than that , it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like "" the godfather : part ii "" and "" the empire strikes back "" as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" picks up precisely where "" babe "" left off  
having won the sheep herding competition , farmer hoggett ( james cromwell ) and his pig are elevated to fame status  
a series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs  hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city  
in doing so , the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" flourishes where so many sequels fail  
most sequels simply rehash the events of the first film  
not "" babe : pig in the city ""  
this is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first  
also , by not being content to utilize most of the old characters , this film gives us many new ones to enjoy  
in essence , it doesn't attempt to copy itself  
instead , it strives to achieve an originality of its own  
and it succeeds  
that's not to say the familiar is absent  
 "" babe : pig in the city "" retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film  
along with babe himself , ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride , as does mrs  hoggett ( one of this decade's best and most underappreciated comic characterizations , hilariously performed by magda szubanski )  
the three singing mice also make the journey , chiming in with their cute high-pitched vocals  
the story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice  
from there , we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne's soothingly deep narrative  
composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these  
but these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting  
while staying at the flealands hotel , babe encounters a veritable ark-full of new animals  
monkeys , kittens , and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new "" urbanites "" that babe befriends , as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter  
each character is distinctly unique , some of which are imbued with personal human-like struggles that are endearing and touching  
and while this world focuses largely on these animals , we are introduced to two new human characters as well  
mary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel , an animal-loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors  
stein's landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature  
we also meet fugly floom , an old soft-spoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel , utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions  
not having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film , it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was  
so as not to ruin this well-kept secret , i won't reveal the actor's identity here  
it was a treat indeed to see one of cinema's legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance  
the greatest triumph of "" babe : pig in the city "" is the art direction "

1,"anyone who saw alan rickman's finely-realized performances in truly madly deeply and sense and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actor-turned-director is a bit of a poet at heart  
however , for those who recall him only as the maniacal villain of die hard and robin hood : prince of thieves , this recognition may be something of a shock  
nevertheless , "" poetic "" is an excellent term to describe rickman's feature debut as a director , the winter guest  
the film has a simple , unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion a successful whole  
the result is an occasionally haunting , sometimes magical , and always insightful human drama  
the winter guest isn't about resolving plot threads and advancing a story line ; it's about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages  
the winter guest does not tell a traditional tale , nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure ? there is no real beginning or end  
instead , we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eight humans  
they represent both sexes , multiple generations , and a variety of relationships ? male and female ; young , middle-aged , and elderly ; friends , would-be lovers , and kin  
we see expectations fulfilled and disappointed , emotional boundaries eroded , and truths unveiled  
there is comedy and tragedy  
most importantly , much of what transpires during the course of the winter guest will find an echo in our own lives ? in this fiction can be found much truth  
the setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of the year  
it's so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over  
the onshore wind cuts like a knife and snow blankets the beach , giving the terrain an alien appearance  
it is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured  
there are four pairings , and , although there is some interaction between the different twosomes , the winter guest's focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship  
the first , meatiest pairing is that of elspeth ( phylida law ) and her recently-widowed daughter , frances ( emma thompson )  
these two have a stormy relationship  
they love each other deeply , but both are stubborn and willful , and neither is willing to admit that they need the other  
much of their interaction is argumentative , but , during the course of a long walk to the frozen shoreline , they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means to the other  
frances' adult son , alex ( gary hollywood ) , is a lonely young man who has been caring for his mother since the death of his father  
on this day , he meets a girl , nita ( arlene cockburn ) , who has secretly been spying on him for weeks  
although their first encounter is antagonistic ( she throws a snowball at him ) , both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction  
once they retire to a place where they can be alone , however , things don't go exactly as planned  
lily ( sheila reid ) and chloe ( sandra voe ) are a couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees  
death is a topic of endless fascination for them , perhaps because they are so close to it , and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries , looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area  
it doesn't matter whether or not they knew the deceased  
it's the ceremony that they're interested in  
sam ( douglas murphy ) and tom ( sean biggerstaff ) , a pair of schoolboy chums , are spending this cold february day cutting classes and hanging out at the beach , horsing around , building a small fire for warmth , and walking on the frozen water  
unlike lily and chloe , these two have their entire lives ahead of them  
they are young enough to still believe in magic , but old enough to recognize that the process of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only children can experience  
the acting is strong and believable  
the mixture of veteran performers and first-timers is effective , with the most successful choice being the casting of real-life mother and daughter phylida law and emma thompson in the most prominent roles  
there is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate with two different , non-related actors  
and , of course , the physical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth and frances as parent and child  
the winter guest began its life as a stage play in 1995 , with rickman as the director  
four of the film's principals , phylida law , arlene cockburn , sheila reid , and sandra voe , appeared in the theatrical version before moving to the film  
unlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays , the winter guest has been successfully opened up "

1,"review : ghost dog : the way of the samurai ( 1999 ) 
cast : forest whitaker , henry silva , cliff gorman , john tormey , gene riffini , victor argo , tricia vessey , isaach de bankole' , camille winbush director : jim jarmusch writer : jim jarmusch 
rating : good shot ( stars ) 
languid , yet pointed and focused , ghost dog : the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek , ultra-cool , cinematic image of the hitman  
juxtaposing the samurai's honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the american/italian mafia , it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptor's precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber , dinosaur-like , to function in the modern era  
director jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast , ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit  
using a palate of bleached colors , jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film  
he doesn't cater to audience expectations of hyper-colorized , stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies  
the action is presented in flat , brutal codas  
bullets have permanence  
death has consequences  
the movie rises beyond standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty  
it is an anti-movie , of sorts  
there are few photogenic , empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with  
this isn't a film that lovingly holds your hand  
there are dark , contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder , just so , asserting itself for all to see  
the fulcrum for the movie's thematic balancing act is ghost dog , a mafia hitman  
a twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer , ghost dog is a hilarious contradiction in terms  
unlike the sleek , muscular killing machines one is accustomed to , we are given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly , replete with chapped , dirty hands and rumpled clothing  
he wears a hooded sweatshirt , which he often pulls over his head , giving him a monk-like appearance  
there are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal  
he uses old , worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical , efficient and pleasureless fashion  
ghost dog is a disciple of the old ways of the samurai , distilling the essence of his life through the filter of a book , which he reads daily , hagakure : the way of the samurai  
life consists of simple pleasures for him : ice cream , warm rooftop naps and good books  
ghost dog lives , as it were , by the basic tenet expressed by his book ; one should start each day considering oneself as dead  
living atop an abandoned building , surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons , ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends  
he craves nothing more  
as he puts it late in the film , "" i've seen all i want to see  "" 
he exists in a spiritual world of the mind , gaining moral sustenance from his readings  
ghost dog wasn't always as he is presented  
in several roshomon-like flashbacks , it's shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan , that "" samaritan "" being a foot soldier in an aging crime family  
ghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man , louie ( tormey ) , as repayment  
after years of loyal service , ghost dog is sent , by louie , to kill "" handsome frank "" , a made man within louie's organization who has run away with the crime boss's daughter , louise ( vessey )  
ghost dog wordlessly executes his task , witnessed by louise , whom he spares , as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon , clutching a copy of the book , roshomon  
in a bit of synchronicity , louise loans the book to ghost dog  
upset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family , the mob bosses , in turn , put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade  
the rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict  
the theme of old cartoons flares up time and again , each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog's world  
each time a character is shown watching a cartoon , it's from the same era , betty boop , felix the cat , etc  , a reflection of days gone by  
near the end , louise is watching a cartoon that's a departure from the previously shown ones  
it's a bit of audacity on jarmusch's part that is nicely effective , despite it's surrealistic nature "

1,"i rented "" brokedown palace "" last night blind , having heard nothing about it beforehand , and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws  
for anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety  
that is no easy task  
superficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably "" return to paradise "" and "" midnight express  "" 
as a result nearly every review of "" brokedown palace "" i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons  
the consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as this is a fine film  
for those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was "" midnight express "" ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of "" return to paradise  "" 
in my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad's acclaimed novel , "" lord jim  "" 
problematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world "" justice "" system  
the girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale )  
they're life-long buddies who planned a high-school graduation trip to hawaii , and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents  
once there , they find a $6 hotel and go sight-seeing , which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside  
they get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room , a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them , but they are saved from hotel security by a charming , friendly australian , nick ( daniel lapaine ) , who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl's scam  
he then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves , first toward alice , then toward darlene  
by now alarm bells are going off among viewers  
the ever-present nick is too slick and his stories don't add up ( to us ) --the girls , of course , are too naive to notice  
long before it happens , we're anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast-talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting-ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin  
just as predictably , the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison-bound for a long stretch  
left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice  
for those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl's fleabag hotel  
as one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed , the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer/fixer "" yankee hank "" ( bill pullam ) and his thai-born partner-wife  
a recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film's tag lines , "" who do you trust ? , "" and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullman's oeuvre will find few surprises  
much of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short-hand fashion  
lou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments  
is he part of a wider conspiracy ? 
with an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them  
the result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls' interaction , hank's investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension--as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape  
if "" brokedown palace "" has a major flaw , it is its creators' tendency , like time-constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half-way down and return to the story's main avenue  
and , if that were all there was to "" brokedown palace , "" it wouldn't be a very good movie  
but i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded  
for the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom--in all its permutations  
ultimately , the other sub-themes may be considered window dressing  
young and pretty , alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild , streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure  
presented as a perfect blend of yin and yang , dark and light , is her cautious best friend , darlene ( beckinsale )  
clear-eyed and straightforward , alice is more complex than her friend  
she comes from a poorer background , has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father )  
whereas darlene's life is "" on-track , "" aimed at college , marriage , kids , a career , a suburban home , middle age and "" fulfillment , "" alice's is uncertain , unfocused , and yearning  
one poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors--friends and relatives from home , whose lives continue while hers is in limbo  
tellingly , alice is present but not included  
just as revealing of their different personalities , when alice and dar first come to thailand , the openness and delight on alice's face doesn't read as simple naivet ? ; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat , reaching toward the sun , she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom , while "" dar "" remains seated in the shade "

1,"review : a dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in 19th century flanders  
living with his grandfather jehan ( jack warden ) in poverty , nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times ( they are renting a spare one-room cottage , and the greedy , malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them `out of the house' if they don't pay the rent )  
nello also has a rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen , in either a movie or in real life  
 ( his hero is peter paul rubens , the great flemish painter of the 17th century  ) 
not that these are the only things that make nello's life happy , however  
he has a dog of flanders , whom he names patrasche , who is a heroic rin-tin-tin of the 19th century , whom he rescues from his cruel , unkind master  
in addition , he even has a best friend ( and future sweetheart ) in the lovely , wealthy aloise , whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with `lower-class' nello  
 ( he thinks he's not good enough for her , and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying  ) 
but then , he was a poor guy himself before he married ( as mentioned later on in the film )  
one day , nello encounters a mysterious , yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande ( played wonderfully by jon voight ) , who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart , and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist  
and every christmas , there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year ; the winner getting a lot of money  
eager to save his home ( and his aging , dying grandfather ) , nello willingly decides to become an artist , asking aloise to pose for him  
one night , the two travel to a circus , where they have their fortune told ? one of the film's most delightful scenes ? that great happiness is destined for them  
she gives the kids a ring , whom nello places on aloise's hand  
 ; ) afterwards , the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers  
unfortunately , things are not all `la-dee-dah' in this tale  
aloise's father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again  
bad enough that they can't see each other ( although we know nello and aloise , don't we ? ) , but that's only the start of nello's troubles  
aloise's farm is burned down , and nello is wrongfully accused ( by the landord of his cottage ) for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise  
this decreases nello's reputation around the town , save aloise and her parents , and a kindly miller , william , who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by  
matters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies , and he has to pay for his funeral  
but then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home ( for not paying his rental ) ? permanetly  
this means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold , freezing wind  
worst of all , the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time , `the portrait of the princess' , fails to win the prize at the festival  
now nello and patrasche are really depressed , and close to freezing to death  
will nello be able to find any happiness in his life ? 
will patrasche save the day ? 
will nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise ? 
a dog of flanders is a delightful , heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages  
even older ones who consider themselves too `sophisticated' for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grown-ups , too  
there have been other movies of this ilk ( boy and dog ) , and while this one falls into that category , it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties and finding a good home for yourself  
move over ? or rather , roll over ? old yeller , this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight  
the cinematography , courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful , and really adds to the powerful drama of the film  
it also gives a feel of being in flanders ( the whole film was respectably shot in flanders )  
the music from richard friedman is also remarkable ; an evocative , poignant score that recaptures music from the 19th century  
the opening song over the credits is very beautiful ( i hope the soundtrack is available ! ) , and there's a brief excerpt of `cheer up , charlie' from willy wonka and the chocolate factory ( sung by aloise , to nello , in another delightful scene )  
the cast is first-rate : jesse james and jeremy james kissner , who play nello , are some of the most endearing , adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life ( so are the girls who play aloise , madyline sweeten as the younger , and farren monet as the older )  
not that they are the only good stars , however  
jack warden is ideal as jehan , eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character  
 ( the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming , touching ones  ) 
also , bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william  
he's another one of my favorite characters in the film "

1,"perhaps it's time for me to say a little about my reading habits  
i really do like to read , and i've enjoyed many books in my lifetime  
my problem is that i'm a slow reader , and not very dedicated -- i'll enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time ( it's taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina , even though i'm loving the book )  
in addition to this , i typically don't read anything created after the 19th century  
the only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting , time after time , that i haven't read any of the books on which these films are based ( the only exception , i believe , is great expectations )  
however , i don't think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film  
needless to say , i haven't read the elmore leonard novel out of sight , on which steven soderbergh's new film is based  
i can't say how faithful of an adaptation it is , or if it lives up to leonard's vision  
i can say that it's a terrific film , with sharp acting , great dialogue , and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh  
it's certainly a nice distraction from 1998's lineup of brainless blockbusters , all hopelessly wishing that size mattered  
out of sight proves that it doesn't  
i had originally written george clooney off as a one-note actor , incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair  
after seeing his latest performance in this film , i've changed my mind -- this guy can act , but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those $20 million superstars  
here , he plays jack foley , a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living  
he does it because it's fun , i think , but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won't start  
he goes to jail -- which is interesting -- only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend , buddy ( ving rhames )  
we're then introduced to karen sisco ( jennifer lopez ) , a u  s  marshall who , conveniently , is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes  
fortunately , they take her hostage , and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety  
the central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another , though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible  
we soon learn that the film is not told in sequence ( and , since this is a gritty crime comedy , flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise )  
at first , i kind of felt that it was a gimmick , but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction , too  
it's a fun gimmick , though , and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally  
i've only seen a few of soderbergh's films ( i was impressed both with kafka and sex , lies , and videotape ) , but i think he's excellent at what he does  
he's an artist without making it obvious , and without being pretentious , which is always admirable  
he uses tricks , yes ( lots of freeze-frame stuff here ) , but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film  
as i said , clooney is terrific , and he's matched by lopez  
lopez is , of course , beautiful , but she can act , too  
i can sense that she's honing in on her skills , for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures ( not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome u-turn )  
the two actors have arresting chemistry with one another -- the best scene in the film , by far , is the seduction scene  
the brilliance of this scene is also due , in part , to soderbergh , for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act which takes place a few minutes later  
the scene is a series of soft nuances and glances , layered upon light dialogue , and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema -- meaningful and engrossing  
the supporting cast is strong , led by the always-reliable ving rhames  
dennis farina , who plays karen's father , is good , as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain  
steve zahn , who plays jack's nearly-brain dead accomplice glenn , steals all of his scenes ( and that's in a film where every scene is already at a high level )  
all of the actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligently-constructed script by scott frank  
out of sight is certainly a light film , although there are a few heavy moments that will linger in the memory  
overall , i can recommend it simply as great entertainment "

1,"jonathan demme's _beloved_ , based on the book toni morrison , is a study in skillful literary adaptation  
on the one hand , the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel , evoking morrison's pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice  
on the other hand , beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book , favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story's main events  
this choice is a smartly made one , for it creates an open space in which the story's wide range of emotions can gestate and grow  
indeed , the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled  
_beloved_ takes place in the second half of the 19th century , during the so-called reconstruction era after the civil war  
for newly-freed slaves , it is a time of confusion and turmoil  
oprah winfrey is sethe , a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse , where she hoped the terror would end  
what she did not know was that it would follow her there , and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished  
_beloved_ ultimately tells the story of sethe's search for forgiveness , one long-hampered by an unforgettable sin  
the film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethe's escape , as a violent , unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse  
invisible hands terrorize her family , flinging objects across rooms , shaking tables , rattling floorboards  
sethe's sons run away , perhaps for good , leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves  
demme's matter-of-fact handling of this supernatural element is just one of _beloved_'s intriguing aspects  
all of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real  
when paul d ( danny glover ) -- a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe -- arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghost's hellish visions , he doesn't run in terror  
instead , he asks who the ghost is  
as in morrison's novel , demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself , but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created  
sethe is the one being haunted , but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears  
in fact , the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay  
the story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved ( thandie newton ) , a young black-clad woman who appears on sethe's front lawn , leaned christ-like against a tree stump  
sethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health  
they know not who she is , but that doesn't matter  
only paul d is suspicious of the stranger  
little does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes , and force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years  
winfrey is arguably beloved's greatest asset  
she inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show  
lisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe , whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later  
danny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d , as is kimberly elise as denver , sethe's wanderlusting daughter  
as sethe's sage-like mother-in-law old baby suggs , beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears  
the film's least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself  
thandie newton plays the glassy-eyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first , but which becomes off-putting and unintentionally laughable by the end  
departing from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as _the silence of the lambs_ and _melvin & howard_ , director demme has used a bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrison's novel  
totemic camera shots and color-saturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demme's films , but the few he uses here work to the film's benefit  
_beloved_'s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs' gatherings in a forest clearing , where the bright yellow-greens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs' words do  
for the most part , though , demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality  
this , combined with morrison's equally frugal method of storytelling , may make _beloved_ somewhat of a challenge to watch , even to those familiar with the book  
though the film compliments the book extraordinarily well , it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects from a film  
nothing is spoon-fed to the viewer "
1,"it's wednesday , march 27 , and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte , south carolina  
the crime : a young prostitute , elizabeth ( renee zellweger ) , has been brutally slain  
one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station  
the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority , miles away  
the police duo of braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are strapped for leads  
at the moment , they have only one possible suspect : wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy , unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act  
that's the premise for deceiver , a new thriller from the pate brothers , jonas and josh , who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave  
deceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not- so-bright cops ( captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland's iq is 151 ; by contrast , kennesaw's is 122 and braxton's is 102 )  
the setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered  
over three days , as wayland returns to answer more questions , the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until , inevitably , it boils over  
other plot elements are thrown in for good measure  
wayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can , in stressful situations , render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent  
braxton , a compulsive gambler , is deep in debt to a local syndicate  
and kennesaw is haunted by a dark , abusive side that delights in terrorizing women , especially his wife ( rosanna arquette ) , whom he suspects of being unfaithful  
the foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth's death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand : the suspect or his questioners  
deceiver , which mostly transpires in a dimly-lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue , has the feel of a david mamet play : edgy , claustrophobic , and tense  
the atmosphere is explosive , and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting  
deceiver has the power to grab an audience  
unfortunately , in the end , it succumbs to the need to throw in one last , unexpected twist , and this is its undoing  
for , while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers , it also stretches our credulity too much , and raises more questions than it answers  
it's only an effective wrap-up if you don't think too carefully about its full implications  
of course , the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic  
police procedure is totally ignored and it's almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner  
but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction , not plot details  
deceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station , and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute  
the pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth's final days and hours  
the most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice-over by visually showing what really happened  
moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks  
the movie , obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir , drips atmosphere  
there are some fascinating stylistic touches ; for example , although the setting is contemporary , all of the telephones are old-fashioned , rotary models  
cinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver's look  
some of the things he tries ( mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow ) work exceptionally well , while others ( like any of several lazy susan shots ) seem more like unnecessary visual tricks  
as wayland , tim roth gives the film's top performance , despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting  
roth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he's supposed to be  
the other two leads , chris penn and michael rooker , aren't as effective  
both play their characters like familiar types  
penn's performance is uninspired ; rooker's lacks subtlety  
some of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors  
renee zellweger , in a role that's miles away from her star-making turn in jerry maguire , brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature "

1,"in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close-up of a blank movie screen at a drive-in  
we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves  
without an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind's eye  
even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema  
but do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ? 
exploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept  
is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ? 
midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth  
as joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration  
during the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne : the alamo  ' 
as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper ? but he's dead  ' 
a troubled expression comes across joe's face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone  
having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody  
joe's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream  
he romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance  
by the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing  
just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success  
but how realistic are these ideals ? 
joe had raped and been raped in texas  
the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas  
alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation  
the ability to pack up one's belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention  
schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe's abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny  
we understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame  
he runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york  
in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe's encounter with the gay student , joe buck spills ketchup on himself  
standing up , we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh  
schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe's virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation  
beyond the symbol of castration , the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin's first sexual encounter , a reference to joe's first homosexual liaison  
the fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe's emasculation  
it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients , but effortlessly attracts men  
joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff  ' 
there are two predominant images of new york  
the first is that new york is the rich , cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty  
the other new york is travis bickle's new york , a seedy , corruptive hell on earth  
joe envisions new york as the former , but is presented with the latter  
mirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine , he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men  
joe thinks he is performing a great service for new york , but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions  
the people steal joe's money , the landlord confiscates his luggage , and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity  
what has become of joe's american dream ? 
schlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party  
joe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food , drugs , and sex  
at the party , all of joe and ratzo's desires are made flesh ; joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami "
1,"much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of "" lolita , "" made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made , over its use of pedophilia , and as such , it's important to address it straight-forwardly , before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed , as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years , lying around in vaults san a distributor , and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit  
when seeing this film , after all the hoopla , keeping in mind that there are people , namely me , who are fans of the novel , who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation    well , 
you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution  
what's even worse is that seeing this "" lolita , "" especially the first time and if you're familiar with anything "" lolita , "" is admittingly very anticlimactic  
this is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film , ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it , it's really quite a film , perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne ( although , really , look at its competition : "" flashdance , "" "" fatal attraction , "" and "" indecent proposal "" ) , at least besides "" jacob's ladder  "" 
i've seen this "" lolita "" twice : the first time , i wasn't so blown away  
it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting  
the second time , not really thinking about how i've waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i'm seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre , it really affected me emotionally  
the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one , which is why it's such a good novel , and why this is such a good film  
the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a  k  a  lolita is great because it's not trash for the perverted but because it's about human obsession with things that are out of one's reach  
its protagonist , the comically-named humbert humbert , is not your average pedophile , but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies  
the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology , something that will destroy us but that we can't live without  
these ideas are all worked into this film nicely , but done in a way that is not heavy-handed at all , but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating  
the focus of this film , and the reason for making it , it seems , was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images , and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized  
the tone of the book is a comical one , but it's also a tragic one , and humbert , telling the story from his perspective , blows every single thing out of perspective  
humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires , and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed  
we get a sense that perhaps it's by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed  
he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love , and allows himself to embody her as lolita  
he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions , and by the end , he has nothing but overly-dramatic feelings for her  
the story recognizes the extreme of this , almost out of a test , seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert , and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author , vladimir nabokov , wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions , and perhaps bring them to peace  
the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end , when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey , we can easily sympathize and even identify with him  
the opening and final images of the film are the same , and who hasn't done a similar action , that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us ? 
this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen , the first time being filmed in - shock - 1962 , by stanley kubrick , who couldn't possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do , but did the next best thing : he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general  
in that film , he used the traps of society as benefits  
the studio demanded the final scene , that of a heinous murder , come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile    and 
when you see it , it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession  
the censors wouldn't allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the , um , relationship between humbert and lolita , so kubrick decided to play it as comedy , but still allow the tragedy to seep through  
looking at these two versions , especially after reading the novel ( and we all know that when we've read a novel and see a film adaptation , we are bound to be angered by any size differences ) , it's really impossible to compare them  
they both go for different things , and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was  
and although it's true that several scenes are similar , and are thus up for comparison , overall it's unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse  
i have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is , and i won't say that here  
however , this film is pretty amazing , mostly because hey , i loved the book , and this film nearly reminded me of it  
it doesn't have nearly as much wit ( a couple comical scenes , and even a lot of good chuckles , but just not totally witty ) , but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had "

2  you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis  
3  they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart  
4  the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10  
5  they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic  
6  the reunion has to bring them together , seperate them with little crises , then bring them back together because , after all , they're friends  
7  there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited  
8  eightly , they're all unhappy or marginally so  
9  there's some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that's built up over the years  
10  the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts , sometimes internationally so  
11  the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends , sometimes causing them to get together in dance/song  
since it follows these rules so closely , it will probably be ( and has been ) coined off as just a "" british 'big chill  ' "" 
and in some ways it is  
both follow the rules , as i said , and both feature lots of bitching , big confessionals , and broken relationships  
but while "" the big chill "" was , at least to me , a tad too whiny and unsatisfying , "" peter's friends "" hits its mark , making this film funny , dramatic , and poignant  
the friends of peter's were all in the same theatre group back in '82 , performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them ( the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus )  
after peter's ( stephen fry ) wealthy father ( richard briers , hardly on screen enough to register , but oh well ) dies , leaving a giant mansion to him , he has to decide whether or not to keep it  
not sure what to do with it immeadiately , he decides to throw a giant reunion party , inviting back all his old chums  
of course , all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule  
andrew ( kenneth branagh , also directing here ) is an actor who's unhappily married to a tv star , carol ( co-writer rita rudner )  
maggie ( emma thompson ) is a successfuly publisher of self-help books , but looks like she needs them more than her customers , as she is lonely and unhappy "

1,"three things i learned from "" being john malkovich "" : when getting on the elevator for your first day of work on the 7 1/2th floor of a building , always bring your crowbar ; don't stand in the way of your wife's actualization as a man ; and , whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being , wear old clothes , because , hey , it's muddy in there  
 "" being john malkovich "" is the most original film to come down the pike in a very long time  
wildly surrealistic , yet presented in a down-to-earth , funky style , this is the kind of movie that sticks in your head  
after savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline , you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it  
from the ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature of identity itself , there's a lot to think about here  
just don't forget to have fun  
clearly , all parties involved in the making of the film certainly did , starting with writer charles kaufman  
 "" i wrote 'being john malkovich' without an outline , "" he explains in the press notes , "" blindly , with no sense of direction or purpose  
it's important to me that i don't have a map before i start  
this allows me to surprise myself , stay engaged , discover things , and , hopefully , allow the unconscious to surface  "" 
spike jonze ( mark wahlberg's na ? ve buddy in "" three kings "" ) takes it from there  
the white-hot director of the beastie boy's "" sabotage , "" an award-winning parody of '70s tv cop shows , as well as numerous other music videos and commercials , eschews typical mtv flash for his feature film debut  
jonze wisely realized that a storyline this unusual is most effectively presented in a low-key style  
his flat , matter-of-fact approach works perfectly  
and then there's the cast  
john cusack plays control freak craig schwartz , a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents objecting to his remarkably expressive , but decidedly erotic puppet shows  
over the years , his marriage to obsessive pet store employee lotte ( cameron diaz ) has devolved  
once passionate lovers , the two are now little more than courteous roommates  
financially strapped , craig takes a job as an entry-level file clerk at lestercorp , located on the 7 1/2th floor of a manhattan building  
navigating around dr  lester ( orson bean ) , his 105 year-old boss and floris ( mary kay place ) , lester's dotty secretary , craig tries to settle into his new position , but two things keep him distracted  
first , there's the beautiful and imperious maxine ( catherine keener ) , who delights in tormenting craig over his obvious lust for her  
and then there's the hole behind the file cabinet , which turns out to be a portal into the mind of actor john malkovich  
craig learns that anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into the subconscious of malkovich , where they can experience life from his point of view ( with enough concentration , you can even influence his actions )  
after 15 minutes , the visitor gets ejected and unceremoniously dumped in a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike  
then things get a little weird  
by the way , if you're concerned that i gave away too much of the plot , rest assured - - i barely scratched the surface  
one of the most satisfying aspects of the fable is that kaufman is not content to simply milk laughs from his bizarre set-up  
instead , he crawls into the dark premise as completely as craig crawls into malkovich , rummaging around and toying with the various philosophical implications of compromising another person's identity  
he also examines the consequences of the malko-visits to craig , lotte , maxine and , of course , john malkovich himself  
the performances are superb  
malkovich ( best known to mainstream audiences for his work in "" dangerous liaisons , "" "" in the line of fire , "" and as head psychopath in the guilty-pleasure "" con air "" ) tweaks his own image in a dandy self-deprecating turn  
far from his effete , vaguely reptilian persona , this malkovich is just another schlub , drinking with his pals and trying to get laid ( incidentally , charlie sheen also plays himself in a hilarious parody of his well-earned bad boy reputation )  
as always , john cusack nails his part , handily pulling viewers along even as craig's actions become unconscionable  
the big surprises come from catherine keener and cameron diaz , both playing against type  
kenner , usually cast in icy subordinate roles , is terrific as a highly intelligent , extremely manipulative femme fatale  
cameron diaz , barely recognizable under a mess of brown , curly hair , sheds her perpetually sunny smile and draws big laughs as a woman thrown into extreme sexual confusion after taking a ride in malkovich  
 "" being john malkovich "" stumbles towards the end , as jonze and kaufman try too hard to resolve the various subplots  
additional characters and increasingly complex explanations lead to a cluttered finale "

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction , the cinematic output from its creator , quentin tarantino , has been surprisingly low  
oh , he's been busy -- doing the talk show circuit , taking small roles in various films , overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn , making cameo appearances on television shows , providing a vignette for the ill-fated anthology four rooms -- everything , it seems , except direct another feature-length film  
it's been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr  tarantino's new feature film , jackie brown , one of the most anticipated films of the year , and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s  
things aren't going well for jackie brown ( pam grier )  
she's 44 years old , stuck at a dead-end job ( "" $16 , 000 a year , plus retirement benefits that aren't worth a damn "" ) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america -- and she's just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette ( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton ) and police officer mark dargus ( michael bowen ) smuggling $50 000 from mexico for gun-runner ordell robbie ( samuel l  jackson ) , who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster )  
the loquacious ordell , based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny , bong-hitting surfer girl melanie ( bridget fonda ) and agreeable crony louis gara ( robert de niro ) hang out , operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat , and he's soon out to silence jackie brown  
meanwhile , the authorities' target is ordell , and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half-million dollars  
only through a series of clever twists , turns , and double-crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses  
although jackie brown marks mr  tarantino's first produced screenplay adaptation ( based on the elmore leonard novel "" rum punch "" ) , there's no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film  
while he's adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense , the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character's now black  
in terms of ambiance , the film harkens back to the 1970s , from the wall-to-wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions  
the opening sequence featuring ms  grier wordlessly striding through the lax , funky music blaring away on the speakers , is emblematic of films of that era  
the timeframe for the film is in fact 1995 , but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro  
of course , nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads , and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists , backstabbing , and deceptions deliciously unfold , the strength of jackie brown is the quiet , understated relationship developed between jackie and max ; when they kiss , it's perhaps the most tender scene of the year  
tenderness ? in a quentin tarantino film ? 
sure , there've been moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer , or even in reservoir dogs , where a deep , unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters -- but for the most part , mr  tarantino's films are typified by manic energy , unexpected outbursts of violence , and clever , often wordy , banter  
these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown , but what's new here is a different facet of his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent , and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation  
this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr  tarantino as simply a helmer of slick , hip crime dramas with fast-talking lowlifes , and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent ; he's the real deal  
this new aspect of mr  tarantino's storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character -- that of the world-weary , sensitive , and exceedingly-professional max cherry , whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching  
mr  forster's nuanced , understated performance is the best in the film ; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie , we smile along with him  
much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation-era icon pam grier in the lead , with the wags buzzing that mr  tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta's then-sagging career  
as it turns out , ms  grier is solid in the film's title role , although nothing here forces her to test her range  
i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection , though -- she's been working steadily over the years , often in direct-to-video action flicks , but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton's mars attacks ! 
and larry cohen's original gangstas ( where she first teamed up with mr  forster  ) 
of course , it's true that her role here was a godsend -- a meaty a part as this is rarity for * any * actress , let alone one of her age and current status in the industry  
while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone , it marks tremendous growth of mr  tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding , and whose characterizations have never been better  
and while the film's narrative doesn't really warrant a running time of 155 minutes , it's filled with such sumptuous riches , ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining , inconsequential conversations between the characters , that there wasn't an unengaging moment "

1,"seen august 8 , 1998 at 6 p  m  at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam , ny ) , theater #6 , by myself for free using my sony/loews critic's pass  
[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] 
war is a topic that can't help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media  
movies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory  
it's easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other  
forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number  
 "" saving private ryan "" is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery  
it proves there's a huge difference between battling and killing  
the film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory  
it's world war ii , d-day to be exact , and the u  s  military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them  
spielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality  
instead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared  
there is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops  
 "" poor "" is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are  
there is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters  
we don't get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding  
the nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they're there  
in the movies , the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch , but in reality that wouldn't happen  
the men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies  
they are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well-secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they're shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off  
perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme  
the film seems to rely on the audience's sense of patriotism , that the american military is "" right "" and good and that the nazis are "" inherently evil  "" 
the battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50-foot progression ) , and begin to inflict some damage  
i have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up , i couldn't help but feel some sense of joy and relief  
to triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure , but there's nothing cliche about the graphic , detailed , atmosphere here because it really happened  
one of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is , and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting  
the plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet  
tom hanks stars as captain miller , a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon  
he's never obsessive or any such generic , cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this  
he doesn't want to be there any more than his men , but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out  
the mission the film is concerned with is , as the title states , saving private ryan  
through a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker , it is brought to a general's attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each's death simultaneously  
when they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe , they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother  
it's easy to sympathize with this situation , after all , no one should have to lose all their children at once  
but finding one man in this war is , as miller puts it , "" like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles  "" 
the saving of private ryan isn't just a dramatic device , but a thematic one "

1,"this has some major spoilers for the film , so be forwarned  
the won't appear till later in the article , so you're safe for now  
eyes wide shot ( 1999 ) running time : 2 hours 39 minutes 2  35 : 1 theatrical aspect 
starring : tom cruise ( dr  
bill hardford ) , nicole kidman ( alice hardford ) , sidney pollack , leelee sobieski , todd field ( nick nightingale ) directed , co-written , produced by : stanley kubrick inspired by : "" traumnovelle "" by : arthur schnitzer 
this is an interesting film  
i must first off state , that you musn't believe any of the rumors of the film  
cruise is not a cross dresser , kidman doesn't shoot heroin , and there's not any scene between the two that would suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist  
the look of the film is to suggest that it follows the translation of the inspired book from the film was written  
the translation , "" dream novel , "" makes you thing that the film should have been titled dream film  
there is a noticable amount of graininess to the film  
rather than complain about it as some may and already have , see it as a style of shooting  
i would gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this and shot with as much natural light as he could  
this and the film looks like it was pushed another two stops to add more grain and brighten it slightly  
as an auteur and stickler for details , kubrick seemed to be a bit lax on this one  
the film looks great , but there are a good deal of bloopers/flubs that occur  
you see lots of boom shots ( in reflection ) and you see the camera at least twice  
16 months for this ? 
wow  
reflection is the biggest killer for this film  
their apartment and almost everything in the film casts reflections and the crew can be seen in these , some quite glaringly  
one more topic of heated discussion : i saw the "" austin powers "" version , and to be perfectly frank , unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be , you'll probably not see them  
two girls standing next to each other look a little suspicious , but i can wait for the unrated version on video to see it the way it's supposed to be  
spoilers below : 
the film itself starts with ( cruise ) bill and ( kidman ) alice getting ready for a little x-mas soiree  
they go to a quite elegant party in what seems to be a storagehouse for lighting equipment , which is actually an apartment owned by pollack  
bill runs into an old friend from medical school who is now the party's entertainment  
soon after , bill and alice are flirting with others at the party , thinking that the other has not noticed  
bill is called to help with a partygoer who has had a bit too much of a good time  
the next day , bill and alice , casually smoking marijunana in their bedroom discuss the previous nights flirtations  
they both discover that they both knew about the flirting  
bill starts talking about what women can provide in a relationship , and gets alice extremely angry  
in her hazy state , she tells of an opportunity she almost acted on to cheat on bill , not caring about the possible aftereffects  
bill gets called away when one of his patients dies , and goes to console his daughter  
when his patient's engaged daughter makes a plea for his love and affection , he is struck with images of an affair that never occured between his wife , alice and a naval officer  
he sees "" opportunity "" as a betrayal to his wife , and before they can continue , they are interrupted  
as he strolls home , he encounters a hooker  
seeing another "" opportunity "" arise , he follows the hooker home  
they toy around , but before the act ensues , alice calls his cell phone  
he breaks the date with the hooker , and heads back out into the night  
he passes a lounge and notices that his old medical school buddy is playing , so he heads in  
when he meets the friend , the friend reveals that for extra scratch , he plays these strange parties , while blindfolded "

1,"shakespeare  you hardly understood it in high school  
why would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn't count on it ? 
if this is your attitude , then i'll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh's hamlet is probably not for you , and you might as well stop reading right now  
if , however , you are a lover of the bard , or at the very least are open-minded about a challenging script , read on , for there is something rotten in the state of denmark  
namely , the king has died , and his widow the queen has wed the king's brother , claudius , but prince hamlet suspects foul play  
his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother's hands  
hamlet , enlisting the help of his friend horatio , conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery     and 
the game is afoot     
the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes  
with external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england ( also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers ) , the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established  
interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers  
the hamlet castle's grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings , mirror-panel doors , and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second-story loft  
costuming is equally grand , drawing upon both history and imagination   
not quite the denmark of the 1600's , the characters' attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia , very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel  
it is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars , respectively  
in addition to directing , kenneth branagh also plays the title character  
as the revenge-driven royal heir , branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows  
from the anticipation of seeing his father's ghost , to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester , to his eventual wrath , branagh delivers in spades  
every scene truly revolves around hamlet , as much a tribute to branagh's acting and directing as to shakespeare's manuscript  
hamlet seems to be a who's who of shakespearean-trained actors , so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself  
julie christie , as hamlet's mother gertrude , and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly , as do many of the supporting players  
kate winslet as hamlet's lover ophelia , does an outstanding job demonstrating the character's plummet to the depths of dispair and madness  
richard briers as ophelia's father , polonius , and michael moloney as her brother , laertes , are equally convincing  
nicholas farrell as hamlet's trusted friend horatio , and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the two-timing rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast  
hamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible  
in some cases , this made for interesting scenes  
billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick , whom hamlet knew quite well  
crystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian , and the result is a very funny scene  
however , charleton heston , whom many might think would butcher shakespeare , is the biggest surprise of all  
as the player king , the leader of a troupe of traveling actors , he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba  
part of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story ( with sir john gielgud and judi dench ) , but this is most unfortunate , for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time  
his off-camera speaking , while gripping , sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well-voiced actor "
1,"after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project , making the third installment in the godfather-trilogy  
this new film has been underrated for no reason  
it is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla's pervious films  
it is also more psychological , pessimistic and more tragic than the first two  
the only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some "" unfinished "" developments of some characters  
the film elegantly begins with nino rota's recognizable musical score , the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael's voice as he is writing a letter to his children : "" the only wealth in this world is children  
more than all money and power on earth , you are my treasure ""  
the year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of "" part ii "" to make his father's dream come true - making the corleone family legitimate  
michael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling  
constantly haunted by the past , his only reason to live is his children  
the family has amassed unimaginable wealth , and as the film opens michael corleone ( al pacino ) is being invested with a great honor by the church  
later that day , at a reception , his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily , "" a check in the amount of $100 million  "" 
but the corleones are about to find , as others have throughout history , that you cannot buy forgiveness  
sure , you can do business with evil men inside the church , for all men are fallible and capable of sin  
but god does not take payoffs  
the plot of the movie , concocted by coppola and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines , brings the corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican  
there is a moment in "" godfather iii "" where michael says : "" all my life i have been trying to go up in society , where everything was legal  
but the higher i go , the crookier it becomes   "" 
  
visually this film is as spectacular as the first two  
gordon willis' rich cinematography , carmine copolla's beautiful composition and alex tavoularis' wonderful art direction could not be better  
but copolla's first two godfather-films were more famous for their deep , intellectual plots , tree dimensional characters and incredible acting , than for their visual perfection  
the third installment has only the plot and visuals  
some characters could be much more developed and the acting , although good , never accomplishes to reach the same height of the first two films  
the biggest miscasting is sofia copolla , who is so unconvincing and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie , that could have been grander and more emotional  
the best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino , who should have got a nomination for best actor at the oscars  
andy garcia is powerful as sonny's son , strong , focused and loyal  
violence is natural to him  
he suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family's behalf , and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was  
however both kay ( diane keaton ) and connie ( talia shire ) are useless  
and characters like vito corleone and tom hagen are really missed  
the good part is that michael is again reunited with old friends , that you remember from the first and second films  
in the third film michael has become almost like his father , vito in the first film and vincenzo resembles michael when he was much younger  
this parallel could be more interesting if vincenzo's character was more developed  
many have pointed out that making the third film , was unnecessary  
i disagree  
it is a beautiful film of great importance , completing the tragic saga of the corleone family  
the first film showed some horrible results of corleone's life "
1,"john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles  
so effortlessly that people tend to forget he's there , much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors ( anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor's face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors )  
example : the other day my mother asked me ( the expert , of course ) if there were any movies out worth seeing , never mind that our tastes couldn't be more divergent--- i'll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes , and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go ! 
was a lot of fun ( which it is ) , so i didn't see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation  
i muttered , with a little trepidation , that she might enjoy high fidelity  
she responded with her usual query , "" whose in that one ? "" 
this is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see  
if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light , a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing , and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people ( usually of the jewish faith ) fretting about in some upper east side palace  
anyway , when i answered "" john cusack "" , she replied with a rather stunned "" who ? "" , as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to  
now i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies , most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin , but i suppose it's understandable that she would not recognize the name , after all , for most , names are tougher than faces  
i showed her a picture of cusack's mug in the paper hoping for an "" oh - him , yes he's quite good "" instead i got a "" no - i don't know him ""  
at this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger ( yes , filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone ) , till i realized something : i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack's relatively bland visage , or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise , one-syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car  
cu-sack  cu-sack - no , not quite as cool  
i'm sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as "" the guy from ( add in the cusack film of your choice ) ""  
he's not a brand name , and his movies usually aren't big moneymakers , but in his own unassuming way he's kind of a genius  
with his pleasant , common man looks , and charming semi-articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90's  
from the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon  
despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it ( the schlumpy every man ) , he's a constantly enjoyable screen persona , like albert brooks or woody allen  
and he knows how to chose scripts , while the stephan baldwin's and val kilmer's seem to put them selves in everything ( the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle , and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent ) , cusack generally picks rewarding projects ( save for the unwatchable hot pursuit , a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller )  
high fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears ( the grifters , the hi-lo country ) , and it's a hit  
it was also co-written by cusack , and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy , grosse point blank  
it's not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film , but as it progresses in its meandering fashion , the movie cast something of a spell over me  
high fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non-committal rob , a vinyl record store owner , who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his "" top 5 break ups list ""  
this is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller's day off  
at first the talking-directly-into-the-camera-schtick had me vaguely annoyed , mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit , but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack's witty delivery  
he's the kind of guy we don't mind talking directly to us  
gradually the film settles into a shampoo-like tragi-comic character study , of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is ( yes it's all very existential )  
though that plot-line is mostly enjoyable , the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters , all of whom ( now this is really something ) are terrific enough to warrant their own films  
the best of which is jack black ( of the very funny show tenacious d , a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis' hair ? ? ? unfortunately that annoying smirk remains ) , an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy  
he's the kind of guy i'm sure we've all met before , a blowhard who thinks he's always right and will do anything in his power ( be it yell , argue , insult ) to hoist his opinion onto others  
but i like this guy , because of how black plays him  
the actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes , but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak ( which might be a bit of a redundant description , seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic )  
he's the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films  
 ( look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister )  
but fears and black never let that happen  
the character , for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality  
he's over the top , but in a way we can all probably relate to  
catherine zeta-jones , in her brief role , gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own "" charm ""  
tim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age-type , a character played entirely for cartoon yuks , but still manages to work its desired comic effect  
the one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy , the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle ( mifune ) , who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent , replacing it with a stilted american phonation "
1,"a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip-hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why today's youth seem attracted to black culture  
the review 
if black & white , the new film from writer/director james toback , is eventually remembered for only one thing , it will be the revelation that brooke shields , claudia schiffer , marla maples and mike tyson can act  
however , this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that  
black & white is a fascinating film ; it makes a statement about america's youth and hip-hop culture without getting heavy-handed overly serious  
featuring a cast of known commodities ( ben stiller , robert downey jr  ) and hot newcomers ( singers bijou phillips ) , toback's is a complex film worth seeing  
black & white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other , a la robert altman  
there is dean the basketball player ( allan houston ) who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear ( stiller ) in exchange for fifty grand a game  
this eventually spills over into the life of dean's long-time friend rich ( power ) , a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem  
rich has to deal with the imminent opening of a white-owned club on his turf  
meanwhile , the young white girls who like to hang around with rich and his homies get talked into being in a documentary by sam donager ( shields ) and her gay husband terry ( downey jr  )  
others who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will , joe pantoliano as his district attorney father , jared leto as a high school teacher , marla maples as the mother of one of hip-hop crazed teens , claudia schiffer as dean's girlfriend , and mike tyson as    
mike tyson  
the stories ebb and flow through the film , losing and gaining prominence over time  
friendships are lost , lovers are gained , and there is an occasional burst of violence  
originally rated nc-17 in the united states , black & white features a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls  
while the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating , viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing  
the three-way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for , and several audience members got up and left at that point  
the frequent sex is one of the film's few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film  
to toback's credit , the level of violence in black & white is almost nil  
these gangstas and hip-hop artists are given real problems and concerns , and only become gun-toting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way  
whenever a character finds himself on donager's handheld digital camera , he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america and proclaims his independence , but not everyone has fully bought into the idea  
charlie ( phillips ) is full of bluster about why she loves hip-hop , but admits that "" in ten years time , i'll be way over this  "" 
these youth know they are going through a phase , and are simply enjoying it  
toback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny  
most of the humour comes from mike tyson , who provides the film's comic relief without really trying  
he is given big words like vernacular to say , and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem with tyson , he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words and explain himself better , playing on tyson's image as a dimwit  
but tyson also gets the film's scariest moment  
as he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry , tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm  
the scene is entirely improvised , with downey jr  being told to just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction  
the reaction he gets , being slapped and then choked is astonishing , as downey jr's face turns a frightening shade of purple  
black & white is a film about hip-hop culture , and the film's omnipresent hip-hop soundtrack strongly supports this  
but toback keeps things from becoming too serious ; by moving from story to story as quickly as he does , toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one character's struggle  
thus black & white's message about hip-hop becomes secondary to the film itself  
toback just wants us to have fun and maybe learn a little about hip-hop along the way "

1,"virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre  
since 'dark city' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another  
the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix  
all the films released after it , have been less successful  
david cronenberg's existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone  
and when 'the thirteenth floor' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored  
i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again  
it was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to 'the thirteenth floor'  
however , i was positively surprised by josef rusnak's latest picture  
matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood's action and effects with an intelligent story  
existenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness  
'the thirteenth floor' is somewhere in between  
instead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , 'the thirteenth floor' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding  
in a near future    on 
the thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real  
right after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered  
douglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth  
a beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence  
the first "" download into simulation "" is impressive  
it is the creator's first visit to his world , his creation  
in order to enter this virtual universe , you have to take over someone's identity , become another person  
this is called conciseness transfer , and this is part of the tragedy in the film : people "" wake up "" in unknown places and strange things start happen  
they start to doubt in their own sanity  
these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their "" users "" and creators with their sanity and their lives  
it is a frightening reality ; the fact that all the people in the simulation ( the program links ) are living out their lives , oblivious , not knowing that they are puppets in someone's fantasy  
with an appealing ( "" blade runner "" - type ) of detective story , this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present  
our modern world is metal and glass -- cold , unfriendly , impersonal  
the thirties are different -- colorful , beautiful , elegant , virile  
this contrast demonstrates a wish for change  
virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical , enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities  
to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise , to some a personal playground -- a life without any consequences  
for others - a way to start over and "" correct "" their mistakes , by living in an illusion of their past  
virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes , dreams and fantasies to life  
at least that's how it is all beginning  
but when you're waking up from your dream , the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise  
this , almost narcotic effect , soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness  
some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised -- what is real ? 
what is thought ? 
who are we ? 
if these were answered , this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made "
1,"when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be "" you too can believe whales can fly ""  
then it was going to be "" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly ""  
then , it was going to be "" you too can believe wood sprites can fly ""  
finally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say    
there's a lot of flying going on in this film ! 
as our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in  
well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released  
part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release )  
subsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved )  
to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high  
in an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us  
after the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters  
is the format effective for the film ? 
with a few exceptions , yes  
the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven's fifth symphony  
it's hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily  
everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts  
eventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things  
though this segment isn't very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies  
the next segment is set to ottorino respighi's "" the pines of rome ""  
in this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape  
a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack  
he is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the "" oceans "" of clouds  
again , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved  
reportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size  
the cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images  
one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent  
absolutely beautiful stuff  
the third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin's "" rhapsody in blue ""  
this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york  
there's a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife  
i won't go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending  
unfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments  
segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich's "" piano concerto no  2 "" and is an animated version of hans christian andersen's "" the steadfast tin soldier ""  
a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can't see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester  
the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina  
little does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from  
the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl "

1,"the bond series is an island in the film world ; where else would we look forward to cliches , and all of the other things that occur in most of these films ? 
where else would pure escapism , a vulnerable hero , the "" talking villains , "" blatant product placement , predictable action sequences , and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a significant change ? 
i don't understand it myself , but that's what the bond series is based on  
for ( i think ) 18 films , we've mostly got the same thing over and over again , with some variation ( and a bit of change , most notably in the two dalton films )  
but even i , a king of cynicism , can't bitch about it  
and "" tomorrow never dies , "" the ( again , i think ) eighteenth bond film , and second brosnan bond film , is no exception  
thank god ! 
the plot , as in most of them , is pure balderdash , but seems to have a nice kind of edge to it  
instead of just plain billionaire psychotics , we get a rupert murdoch-esque media mogul/psychotic - elliot carver ( jonathan pryce , looking bitching with a white-haired cru cut , and always talking like he's out of breath ) , who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war  
no , this is not "" wag the dog "" - he wants a real war , between china and england , and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it    in 
comes bond  
james is sent all around the world , trying to do research on carver , fighting with his men , and running into ( on more than one occasion ) a chinese secret agent like him : wai lin ( michelle yeoh , asian action star extraordinaire    and 
co-star of "" supercop , "" nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one )  
the two eventually , and predictably of course , begin working together , and yes , there is some sexual tension between the two  
luckily , their relationship is never strained , and she never gives into his cassanova-ness until the finale  
thank god again  
in every bond film , james bags , on average , three women ( sometimes more , sometimes less - the latter being more potent towards the aids-cautionary dalton ) , and he doesn't spoil this one ( though we never see them , of course - i mean , they need to stay around a pg-13 rating )  
there's always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again , the big bond girl ( yeoh ) , and this time we have an almost-cameo by teri hatcher as carver's wife , paris , who , it seems , was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning  
yes , teri's very attractive , but she seems kind of dull  
of course , it's not really her fault ; her part is under-written , and she's only in a small part of it  
oh well  
and there are always the big henchmen , the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains  
this time we get a tall , arian-looking ( not to mention robert shaw in "" from russia with love "" -looking ) guy named stamper ( goetz otto ) , who is pretty awesome , although a bit stiff ( well , mostly his posture , really )  
and for a bit of comedy , we get a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point  
the government people have small parts , as usual , with q ( desmond llewelyn , looking near death , sadly ) getting only one scene ( in a more grouchy mood than usual ) , and m ( judi dench ) , getting more than m usually gets ( i mean , it is judi dench )  
and for no reason whatsoever , except 'cause he was so good in "" goldeneye , "" joe don baker shows up again as wade , admitting he has no reason for being there , and is this time more annoying  
again , oh well  
the action sequences are not a let-down , although sometimes go on too long  
they pop up every now and then , mainly because they have to ( for the sake of the series ) , and some significant ones are the opening one , one in a garage with a bmw that runs on remote control , and a motorcylce chase ( on a bmw cycle , nonetheless ) through china streets ( or was it vietnam    the 
plot's not really essential )  
they're more high-tech , and feature much more laughs , which , yeah , i dig  
so what if they're distracting ; they're supposed to be ! 
the acting , from most around is great  
yeoh is , actually , one of the better bond girls , mainly because she's so unique  
the better bond girls are more independent , and have a certain wily-ness to them  
pussy galore , with her homoerotic undertones and all , is one of the best , and diana rigg , who married bond at the end of "" on her majesty's secret service "" only to be killed , added some emotional depth  
yeoh is notable since she's so active , and has great chemistry with brosnan "

1,"zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we don't understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film  
zero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he'd like to think so )  
however , he's a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are  
zero's accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a "" normal "" guy who does the business side of the job -- he's the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero's greatness as an investigator  
the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero's talents to soon-to-be client gregory stark ( ryan o'neal )  
it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about  
zero takes the case , and the plot thickens  
his path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens )  
despite her luminous and seemingly-harmless presence , she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark  
through his investigations , zero learns why , but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that , because of his reclusive behavior , are new and confusing to him  
i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film  
i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators , and , every once in a while , a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually , no private eye film has ever reached chinatown's greatness )  
zero effect , which is jake kasdan's first effort as writer/director , is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts : it's an original , funny , and completely involving motion picture  
with so many cliches available to this genre , i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them  
but he didn't just successfully avoid flaws : he has created a great film here , one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment  
take , for starters , the great cast of characters  
pullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that i really haven't seen from him since spaceballs  
zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that he's an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe  
pullman's performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice-over as he's going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious  
ben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he's the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny  
 "" i'll shoot you , "" he says to stark at one point  
 "" i have a gun , and everything  "" 
his character is also well-drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job  
o'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs  
i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film  
kasdan's humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes )  
it's the kind of humor that's funny even after you've seen it five or six times  
there's one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective  
what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular  
i can't convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero  
as a side note , i don't consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa  
there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it  
i have a feeling the humor here won't appeal to everyone , but there's certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone's interest  
jake kasdan , son of writer/director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old  
i found this out after seeing the film , and i can't remember ever being so impressed with a film maker  
his direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed  
zero effect is the kind of film that i'll buy for my collection -- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul  
at the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome  
and , with kasdan's undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future "
1,"recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantville-one from entertainment weekly , one from a newsgroup , and two from different online resources  
each review compared this film to the truman show  
why ? 
the only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television  
other than that , the two movies are completely different from each other  
reviewers seem to love to pick one movie ( i  e  
the truman show ) , obsess over it , and make it a guideline for other movies  
when pleasantville and edtv opened , all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman  
the same goes for the thin red line , as well  
when it opened in decemeber , probably 98% of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg's saving private ryan , giving thin line no chance whatsoever  
critics loved private ryan so much , that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards  
this is why i think pleasantville was underrated  
if the truman show had never been made , pleasantville probably would have received better reviews , done better at the box office , and would be remembered after it's long been on the video store shelves  
sure , it wasn't perfect , and it wasn't very believeable , but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars , and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history  
with the exception of don knotts as the annoying "" tv repairman "" the film is cast perfectly : the ice storm's tobey maguire is david in real life ; he watches the old 50's sitcom "" pleasantville "" to escape from his feuding parents  
his twin sister , jen ( reese witherspoon ) is a popular slut who ( steriotypically ) smokes and wears revealing clothes  
but what makes her character believeable is the dialogue-those excessive 90's terms such as "" like "" , "" whatever "" , and "" cool "" make her sound like the total dimwit she's supposed to be  
the twins , with a little help from a tv repairman ( casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameo-esque cast rather than a true acting one ) , are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote  
their new parents , played by william h  macy and joan allen , are perfect in every way  
their new names are bud and mary sue , and right away they start to corrupt the town of pleasantville  
after the siblings fit comfortably in their new roles , the movie begins to take form  
it's just like watching a sitcom in itself ; you don't want it to end  
 "" mary sue "" has sex with her date , the school basketball champion ; when he tells all his friends about it , they stop preforming perfectly at basketball , and things start to take color  
soon we learn that these people don't know how to express true emotions , and when they learn to do so , they eventually turn into color  
this eventually sparks a racial war between the "" coloreds "" and the "" black & whites  "" 
entertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claims the movie has , "" none of the depth , poignance , and brilliance of the truman show    "" 
yes , the truman show was maybe a little more intelligent  
but the racial setting-intensified by the forcing of the coloreds to sit in the upper box of the courtroom-certainly classifies as deep , considering it's what i least expected  
gary ross did not try to create an intelligent , award masterpiece-he just tries to convey moral messages within his work  
take for example big and dave , his past films  
big-be careful what you wish for  
dave-good or bad lying is still lying  
did these movies win big awards ? 
no , but they won the heart of millions  
pleasantville could have done that too , if it wasn't for snotty reviewers who set precedents with preceeding films  
pleasantville : a- ad2am "" i almost lost my nose  "

1,"there is a striking scene early in "" city of angels , "" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise  
the camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black  
then the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up  
you see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch  
it is an important scene for several reasons  
first of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible  
the film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference  
there are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like "" angels in the outfield "" ( 1994 ) or "" michael "" ( 1996 )  
the angels here are stark and believable  
this early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god's angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air  
there is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well  
they eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven  
like human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure  
 "" city of angels "" is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan )  
he first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven  
maggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies  
angels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it's not enough  
he wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance  
he learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to "" fall "" and become human  
he learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( "" n  y  p  d  
blue "" ) in a touching and humorous performance  
sitting at a diner together , franz tells cage's character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person's skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children  
of course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it  
 "" city of angels "" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender's haunting 1988 film "" wings of desire  "" 
wenders' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened  
the americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human  
and , unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare , it doesn't suffer extensive damage  
this may be because director brad silberling ( "" casper "" ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( "" blink "" ) wanted to make "" city of angels "" its own movie - inspired by "" wings of desire , "" but not an attempt to copy it  
and yet , "" city of angels "" is not a typical hollywood movie  
it is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( "" the english patient "" ) , whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world  
seale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene , there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around , looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by  
while the film travels along a charted plot , it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are  
both cage and ryan give soulful , soft-spoken performances  
ryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch  
cage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have  
what is most striking about "" city of angels "" is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging "

1,"maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it's not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month , because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker , broadcasted on abc on a monday night , starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth , respectively  
because it's not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why it's so great  
underneath the to-die-for cinematography , the brilliant acting , and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty , not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it , tell it in a certain original way  
it doesn't merely go from plot point to plot point  
it goes from character to character  
it obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all , and makes the story of a world-reknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters , both musicians , who have a totally unique relationship  
it's that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball , shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this , unlike "" patch adams , "" effortlessly emotional and real  
in short , this movie is just awesome  
it merely tells its story really well , and that's something that just has to be commended these days , when most stories are botched because they're not told by great storytellers  
director anand tucker tells this story well  
he overdramaticizes everything , but still keeps it real  
the film tells the story of hilary and jacqueline du pr ? ( rachel griffiths and emily watson , respectively ) , two sisters who are first seen in childhood ( played by auriol evans and keely flanders , respectively ) as the very best of friends  
they are also both musicians , hilary a flutist and jackie a cellist , and when it all begins , both are considered child prodigies , but hilary is seen as the better of the two  
jackie , a bit jealous , works and works at her playing skills , and soon the tables are turned  
when they both hit adulthood , hilary strives for a comeback , while her sister is playing in famous halls around the world , but instead of fame , captures the heart of a hapless , joyful conductor , kiffer finzi ( david morissey , in a semi-star-making turn )  
they marry , after a short courtship , and move to a lovely country house , making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes a symbol of her current life : when she plays , she has the eyes of the world , but when she stops , she's alone  
she enters into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist , daniel barenboim ( james frain ) , in hopes that she may overcloud her sister , but she eventually begins to lose it , and runs away to hilary's country home , where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husband , since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure  
it's all terribly melodramtic , as you can see , and by the time jackie has contracted ms ( in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semi-smiliar "" shine "" in technical and emotional devastation ) , it would have been the time that i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn't been handled in such a way  
the key thing here is that it's not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that it's about her tumultuous relationship with her sister , which , i might add , is perfectly realized  
their relationship is the most down-to-earth complex entity of the year : they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world , but they're also completely jealous of one another  
when a young jackie surpasses her playing abilities , she tries in vain to make a comeback but can't , and almost seems to marry to get back at jackie for her success  
when jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry a wonderful man , she is jealous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that i've ever seen in a film ( only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man )  
and the whole time , their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested  
another thing i really liked is emily watson's performance  
i usually make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal disease ( or any combination of the three )  
my reasoning for this is that it's a fucking easy job  
the worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in "" beloved "" : sure , she's good , but what's so tough about playing a woman who stumbles around , slurs her words together , and acts like a three year old inside a 20-year old's body ? 
hell , i could play that if i had a pair of breasts  
in that same exact movie , though , is a performance by kimberly elise where she has to be the rock that holds the family together as her mother slowly goes insane , her brothers run off never to be seen again , and her mother's lover is scared off  
she has to actually deal with real emotions , something much harder than mere stumbling about  
but the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons  
if you don't believe me , look at jack nicholson's performance in "" as good as it gets "" : great performance , but easy job  
this isn't so for watson , though , because her insanity comes from real emotions , not just a plot point  
and thanks to the opening sequence , where we see her and hilary as kids , we understand the motives behind all her actions , and by the time she actually contracts ms and begins to loose her sanity and her life , we've already understood that this is the last straw for a woman plagued with terrible neuroses  
rachel griffiths , who would have otherwise been the understudy to watson's protagonist , actually matches watson step-for-step , because as watson grows insane , and demands unspeakable things from her , griffiths holds her own , and has to deal with what she is able to give her sister who needs emotional help from her  
griffiths , an otherwise unknown actress ( and watson being famous from "" breaking the waves "" and "" the boxer "" ) , is absolutely brilliant , just as absolutely brilliant as watson is , and if the academy and all the other critics groups , who've already deemed watson's performance the best of the year , glance over hers because she's the one who doesn't get to go insane ( read : she gets the boring role ) , then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me  
after all , griffiths has the thankless job of keeping things real - the tom cruise role in "" rainman "" ( the one who should have gotten oscar consideration and not hoffman )  
she does , and if anyone deserves accolades from the academy this year , it's griffiths  
together , the two actresses work extremely well , though , and both have to go through deep emotional hell , the likes of which haven't been seen this year  
if it hadn't been for an otherwise not-totally-great final section that deals way too much with jackie and not enough with hilary ( when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety ) , i'd say this is one of the top ten best films of the year "

1,"matthew broderick and high school comedy  
the two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986  
now it is 13 years later , and broderick has another high school comedy , election , to show the world  
ferris buehler's day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows  
it was light , fluffy , tasty , and sparkling clean  
but election is far different  
this production is a dark , and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies ; it shocks as well  
jim mcallister ( matthew broderick ) is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud  
he is a kind , caring , younger man who has built his life around carver high school  
in turn , carver high school has provided a home for him  
jim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span , and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body  
tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an intelligent , outgoing , and , to quote the film , "" super nice "" young girl  
she is involved in numerous extracurricular activities , always has her hand up first in class , and is extremely popular among most of the student body  
so , it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president  
the metzler family is an extremely wealthy one  
the father , dick ( holmes osborne ) , owns a cement company  
the mother , jo ( jeanine jackson ) , is an ideal housewife  
and the two children , paul ( chris klein ) and tammy ( jessica campbell ) , are both students at carver high school  
paul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself , and is definitely a candidate for most popular person in school  
tammy is a lesbian who , to say the least , is going through a period of self discovery  
for reasons of revenge , hatred , and sexual envy , jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president  
he claims that in a democracy you need choices , and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts  
so paul agrees and the race is on  
but then , in an effort to spite the two candidates , tammy announces that she is running as well  
her campaign is straightforward : people only run to put it on their college applications , then they do nothing  
well , "" i don't even want to go to college , "" she says  
in election , there are no "" good guys ""  
almost everyone has their own agenda  
no matter how deeply hidden , the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience  
tracy is the type of person that you remember from high school  
she is the girl that would be labeled "" most likely to achieve anything she wants "" in the yearbook , and everyone secretly envied her because of that  
jim is a teacher that takes the trust that students give him as a privilege , and uses it to his own amoral advantage  
everyone , including the principal , a former teacher , all the candidates , and even paul's girlfriend are two sided characters  
that is much of this film's beauty , it doesn't have the typical good guys that hollywood likes , instead it is a realistic portrayal of the real world , specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themselves  
matthew broderick couldn't have been any more perfect for this role  
his character is often similar bill murray's award winning role in the 1998 film , rushmore  
of the two acting jobs , broderick's is far superior  
but even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon  
the hatred that she causes the audience to develop towards her , is simply indescribable "

1,"the makers of jurassic park & the director of speed conjure up a storm ! 
 ( reviewed at eng wah's new jubilee cineplex at ang mo kio ) 
 "" unlike earthquakes , their fury is precise  
unlike hurricanes , their reach is unlimited  
unlike fires , there is no way to combat them  
unlike floods , their terror is sudden  "" 
- excerpt from twister production notes 
i'm sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen tornadoes ( or twisters ) before  
i for one , have only seen the devastating effects and footage of tornadoes from news reports on tv and personally , i feel tornado-caused destruction comes no where near the destruction caused by hurricanes and earthquakes         that is until i saw twister  
the destruction caused by twisters may be precise ( not widespread but it moves very fast and its path of destruction is unpredictable  
it will suck in cars , houses , livestock , etc      
basically anything in its path that is not firmly rooted to the ground and in twister , you'll get to see all this - close up ! 
twister tells a tale about a group of storm chasers  
these people are basically out-of-their-mind and for the sake of obtaining data on twister-occurrences , they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes , trying to get as close as they can      that 
is if the tornado does not suddenly decide to change its path towards them ! 
jo ( helen hunt ) is the leader of this pack of kamikazes  
while they are gearing up for the mother-of-all-storms as predicted by satellite recon , bill ( bill paxton ) , a former co- leader of the team returns to settle some divorce papers with jo  
apparently , bill has left his rogue-ish days for greener and more practical pastures - as a television weatherman  
he catches up with his old-self and follows the pack like the good ole days , bringing his wife-to-be melissa ( jamie gertz ) along , a city-bred woman toting around with a handphone  
jo has finally implemented bills initial idea of a device called dorothy which measurement's of a twister may lead to a better understanding on how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable early-warning system can be implemented  
the problem is , the device has to be placed very near the twister , and in its path ( which is practically unpredictable ) of destruction in order for it to function  
to add to their current challenge , there is another group of storm chasers that is corporation-funded led by jonas ( cary elwes ) and they too have a similar device  
thus begins the race ; jo's cheap government equipment with beaten-up vehicles against jonas's high-tech computers and satellite link-ups with their sleek , black all-terrain vans  
plot wise , there are not really anything to shout about  
twister is as predictable as any summer box-office hit can get  
there is the danger of the twister , the competition with jonas^os more well-off team and of course , the settling of differences between jo and bill ( this part gives the film its human substance )  
helen hunt , bill paxton and the rest of the actors/actresses give only average performances and all of them take back seat to the main thespian in this movie - the twister itself ! 
thanks to the impressive digital effects by ilm ( lucasfilm's industrial light and magic ) , we get to see the terror and destruction caused by tornadoes up close ; from stripping barns and houses to lifting up livestock ! 
jan de bont once again proves his visual abiility ( thanks to his years of experience as a director of photography for action films ) for action sequences  
like his previous film speed , the tornado sequences ( which are essentially the action sequences ) are well visualised and edited "
1,"sam ( matthew broderick ) is an astronomer in a small american town and engaged to teacher linda ( kelly preston )  
he is head over heels in love and lindas sudden departure to new york city to live with her new lover anton ( tch ? ky karyo ) comes as a complete surprise to him  
but as we all know love is blind and so sam leaves for new york as well to win her back  
he moves into an abandoned house across the street from anton's apartment and installs a camera obscura to watch them  
suddenly anton's ex maggie shows up , but she does not want her former lover back  
on the contrary , all she wants to do is vaporize him  
she may say that she doesn't want to kill him , but the possibility doesn't bother her too much either  
after all , people die every day  
in spite of their different motives the two team up and fall for each other as things move on  
the story sounds like something we all have seen a million times  
but we haven't  
griffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy since "" while you where sleeping ""  
the camera obscura adds a "" special something "" to the movie and makes it an exceptional romantic comedy  
everything about the movie is perfect , from set design to casting  
the dialogues are inspired and the touches of black humor add a certain bite  
meg ryan , known from "" when harry met sally "" or "" sleepless in seattle "" , surprises in a role that may finally help her get rid of her sweet little girl image  
she impresses the viewer as a maneating biker girl  
even more surprising is the fact that the viewer believes her , much more so than in last years "" courage under fire "" where she played a gulf war pilot  
matthew broderick is the goodnatured and somewhat naive sam who has trouble accepting reality  
the viewer can tell that he doesn't only watch the stars but also tries to reach out for them  
he has trouble keeping in touch with reality  
after all , who would leave everything behind to chase a lost love ? 
his naivet ? that we don't question for a minute throughout the movie clashes with maggies exaggerated wish for revenge  
she would do anything to harm anton  
she doesn't hesitate to use sam for her plan and makes him understand right from the beginning that nothing will happen between the two of them  
that makes the scenes when they innocently share a bed , have potatoe chips and watch the action across the street like a saturday night show on tv even funnier  
tch ? ky karyo is perfect as anton  
he is , well , repulsive  
that's all there is to say about him  
you can't really manage to pity him , even after all his mishaps  
he not only took sam's bride away from him , he is also a french chef  
worlds collide , i  
e  
the usa and france  
this can only go wrong  
even if maggies revenge schemes are at times shocking , you just can't sympathize with a man who plays "" je t'aime    moi

not everyone is captured by the french charme that linda and even maggie fell for "
1,"is it just me , or have disney films gradually lost their appeal ? 
i was almost stunned by the quality of "" who framed roger rabbit ? "" , a fun , unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together  
 "" the little mermaid "" harkened back to , and perhaps surpassed , the classic disney animations from the first half of the century  
however , the endless stream of "" the little mermaid "" wanna-be's is getting to me  
you know the spiel : a lame plot recycled from some well-known story , colorful , almost psychedelic animation , the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson , the comedic sidekick/sidekicks , the seemingly unattainable love interest , a few catchy songs , a few in-jokes for adults , and the occasional out of place warner-brothers-coyote-fall-off-the-cliff type joke  
it's a formula , and like any formula , it gets tiresome  
that's why i'm delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli , a japanese cartoon studio  
from what i've seen of their movies ( "" kiki's delivery service "" and the already english-dubbed and american- distributed "" my neighbor totoro "" ) , foreign audiences are in for a treat  
these movies , particularly "" kiki's delivery service , "" are wonderfully original and entertaining  
 "" kiki's delivery service "" starts with an unusual premise : kiki , upon hearing forecasts of clear skies , decides it is time for her to leave home  
this is unusual because kiki isn't a college student or a young adult making her start on the world , but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch  
her mother is also a witch , and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training , her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance  
just the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences , but no mention is made of the occult , and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie : kiki's mother acts as a village doctor , and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom  
kiki must choose a city to move to , and what she chooses is the co-star of the movie : a german seaport town , far removed from the country life she has been used to  
initially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding , she's discouraged , and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as a witch  
on the verge of leaving for a new town , she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it  
the favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courier , a one-persons delivery service  
this is where the movie becomes shockingly good  
kiki's job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her  
the townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn't seem forced or artificial , but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light  
they're three- dimensional , impossible to quickly evaluate , possessing of faults , and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl  
however , each one has something about them , some interest or trait , that makes them interesting and unique  
the personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings : the seaport town genuinely looks impressive , capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the 1950's  
this beauty is beauty with depth ; for every detail left in , dozens are only hinted at  
i could probably go on all day , but i won't ; suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie  
some of my favorites are kiki's relationship with the baker's husband : although he's quiet , never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie , and he initially scares her , his kindness wins her friendship  
in the garage of a deliveree's house can be found a vintage model t  two old ladies have a relationship evolving from master-servant to friend-friend  
such details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg  
added on top of this is a lesson on the importance of self-worth  
kiki initially seems to derive much of her self-worth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her , but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment , making her question the importance of such beauty  
this causes kiki to lose faith in herself  
however , kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings , but the innate beauty inside her  
seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous , and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i don't even want to hint at it  
the ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and , ironically , the most disney-esque moment i've ever seen ; if you don't hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention  
the movie steers free of many of the disney conventions : there is no violence , however cartoonish , no song-and-dance number , and kiki's pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick , although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes  
however , i would be surprised if disney doesn't give jiji more jokes , or at least the voice of some comedian  
refreshingly enough , the moral lesson of the movie is not self-contradicted , a habit disney movies have gotten into  
 "" beauty and the beast "" 's beautiful belle , for instance , learned that beauty was derived from a person's inside , and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing  
kiki , on the other hand , learns to separate her wardrobe from her self-image , and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film "

1,"kadosh means sacred in hebrew  
amos gitai's fictional work , after spending most of his career doing documentaries , is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage , even though the marriage is a loving one  
the marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli's modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic's intolerable one , as both groups are vying for control of the secular government  
gitai ( devarim/yom yom ) is a labor party leftist , who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government , it would sound the death knell of israel  
the emphasis of the film is on how the ultra-orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god's law from only the male's view  
that if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are  
the story takes place in jerusalem's jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel  
this is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief  
it is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go  
the force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance  
the film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they can't at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace  
the film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual , where every prayer is made to the virtues of god  
he even thanks god that he didn't make him a woman  
his wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom  
she looks at him with glistening eyes , not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life , and from seeing movies and tv  
meir is a talmudic scholar  
his father ( abu warda ) is a rabbi at the yeshiva  
he has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child  
since the hasidim look upon a woman's role in life being only to conceive children , and cook and clean house for the man , while the man's role is to spend his time in prayer , therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage  
she receives an anonymous letter that states "" a woman without a child is no better than dead  "" 
meir's response , is that it is written like that in the talmud  
meir's father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken : "" a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah  "" 
all the blame is placed on rivka , who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren  
she will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself , as her rigid mother ( koenig ) dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel  
their religion doesn't permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor  
rivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile , but she cannot tell him that because of their religion  
so when meir's father chooses a younger woman for his son , she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters  
rivka's spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life  
she has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov  
but , because of the way they were both raised , she is still a virgin  
when yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon , something his sect is not allowed to do , he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer  
he now works as a singer in a nightclub  
malka's mother is worried that her daughter won't get married , so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef , someone whom she doesn't love  
yossef is a very stern follower of the order , he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a sound-truck with a bull-horn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies  
the two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options , with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage , it will make her happy ; but , while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it , she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage  
the harshest scene in the film is on malka's wedding night  
yossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs , and without the least bit of affection , only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies , as he goes inside her and rams her hard , thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love  
the sisters have choices , like everyone else in life does  
but the choices are obliterated by one's beliefs , circumstances , and inward nature , and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up "
1,"after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again  
there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice  
 "" you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , "" he says , "" then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , 'see you soon  ' "" 
of course , it's meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety  
you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience  
experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts  
trust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point  
juzo itami's tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan  
a stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka )  
goro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious  
goro finds that tampopo's ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen  
the problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing  
however , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy  
this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems  
take , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner  
the price is too high , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum  
tampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room  
she protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists  
just when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door  
she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience  
this scene , while comical , is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery  
there's also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers  
we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet  
the scene is meant to bring a laugh , but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor , food is something which everyone has in common , and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all  
there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film , which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people's lives  
a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor  
surrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life  
her husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that she get up and make dinner  
the viewer knows the husband's intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived , and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this  
in a near miracle , the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family  
as the family eats , she looks on them and smiles  
preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her , and for a brief moment , she too enjoys the normalcy  
then she falls over , dead  
for a moment , the family is stunned , but then the father yells at the children , "" keep eating ! 
this is the last meal your mother ever made ! "" 
crying as they do so , the family finishes the meal  
the scene is comical , awkward , moving , and beautiful  
by including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film , but surprisingly , they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline  
instead , they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo's goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble  
because the film parodies a western , the construction of the plot is fairly predictable , but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the "" good guys "" come together for the final showdown  
in this case , the showdown is against the ramen "
1,"i'm an avid fan of the "" alien "" saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it )  
of course , that doesn't mean that i'm gonna be giving this a four-star review or something , because "" alien : resurrection , "" the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were  
however , it's a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series  
in short , i had a good time  
 "" alien : resurrection "" leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre's answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one  
of course , the last one wasn't very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn't financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! )  
so back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that's a bad thing , but it's becoming a cliche )  
so she's cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called "" the auriga "" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr  wren , played by j  e  freeman , as well as the little-seen dr  gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her  
once you get past the fact that you can't figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film's okay  
also on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and    winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won't state it , but unless you've been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it's nicely covered up )  
there's a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it's never really deepened enough  
oh well  
well , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship  
and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who's death is comical yet sad since , well , he's dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth  
of course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old "" alien "" -brand fun  
the real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there's always a bit of it , most notably in "" aliens "" with the relationship between ripley and the little girl )  
what's interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach  
 "" alien "" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights  
 "" aliens "" is a wild , tense thriller  
 "" alien 3 "" is a bleak , moody piece of semi-noir  
 "" alien 4 "" is kind of like an off-beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares  
jean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like "" das boot "" has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat  
the chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there's the most tense surgery scene since "" face/off "" towards the beginning )  
and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that  
this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others  
there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed  
one is the aforementioned surgery scene  
another one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome  
the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet's earlier film , "" delicatessen "" )  
and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to "" goldfinger "" )  
but the best scene in the entire film ( i'm sure i'm not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an "" 8 "" tatooed on her arm )  
it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga "

1,"i've never been a member of the robin williams fan club  
a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i'm watching a 40-year-old class clown  
in his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances  
mrs  
doubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams' best comic screen project yet  
while it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs  
doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy  
williams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior  
one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce  
unemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda's ad for an afternoon housekeeper  
he turns to his brother frank ( harvey fierstein ) , a theatrical makeup artist , and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire , a matronly 65-year-old englishwoman  
daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda's flirtation with a wealthy client ( pierce brosnan ) , to spend time with the children , and to learn something about responsible parenting , all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best  
mrs  doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so  
the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that's instantly believable  
it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman's dorothy michaels look like milton berle  
more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it's a bit hard to swallow that she doesn't recognize any of the voices as her husband's  
perhaps the biggest contrivance we're asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs  doubtfire in a few minutes  
there's more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask  
fortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll  
during the film , i was generally too busy laughing  
after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams' riffing , mrs  
doubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place  
daniel's frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away  
clearly , most of the credit for doubtfire's success goes to robin williams  
it took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn't just robin williams with a different name  
he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul-mouthed  
wisely , he never aims for saintly  
his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity  
it's one of mrs  
doubtfire's charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect , just people trying to be better  
as miranda , sally field is solid in a background role , and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu  
the children are also good , although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest  
the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing  
it's easy to see mrs  
doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over , and it's true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common  
but mrs  
doubtfire manages to carve out its own space , particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge's decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda's relationship "
1,"let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal  
so i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal  
i watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times  
under no circumstances , should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix  
this theater , owned by the parent company of one of hollywood's biggest studios , hasn't even graduated into stereo sound yet  
the mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age  
in other words , the sound sucked  
as someone used to digital sound in a movie theater , bad sound doesn't do anything to add to a film  
i'm not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together  
there , i've had my rant , now on with the regularly scheduled review  
which sadly won't include commentary on the film's sound which i'm assuming was spectacular , but i'm just guessing  
my guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix  
it is nothing short of stunning visually  
sadly , the rest of the film , while pretty good , doesn't quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good  
the matrix has at it's core a good concept , although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked  
keanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax  
it turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster  
now machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator , plugged into a computer network  
the computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed  
the population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose  
that is except a small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons  
they now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie  
reeve's character , neo , is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus ( laurence fishburne )  
newcomer carrie-anne moss and one of hollywood's most underrated actors , joe pantoliano , join fishburne in the band of freedom-fighters  
the action sequences are nothing short of spectacular  
this can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor's extensive pre-production training in martial arts  
this lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film  
when you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world , it all adds up to an eyeful  
as i already said , the visuals far outpace the rest of the film  
acting in the matrix is not bad , but it certainly isn't real good either  
keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances  
although to his credit , it is one of his better performances  
laurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a sci-fi action film  
more than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama  
joe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had  
carrie-anne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role  
it's nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks  
you have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film  
it was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences "

1,"director dominic sena ( who made the highly underrated kalifornia ) and producer jerry bruckheimer ( the rock , armageddon ) bring us a slick and entertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen  
nicolas cage plays memphis , a retired car thief who's "" pulled back in "" to the business by an evil car thief overlord ( christopher eccleston ) determined to kill memphis' kid brother ( giovanni ribisi )  
memphis is ordered to steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise , all while having to elude the detectives hot on his trail and a rival car thief who feels the job should have been given to him and his gang  
memphis sets out to put his old crew back together , but discovers that most of them have retired as well  
gone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits  
in that sequence , we get a rockin' little tune from moby , along with some simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects  
filmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence , and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride  
and what follows doesn't disappoint    
cage turns in one of his good performances here ( he can easily go either way    
good or bad    
i don't know how he does that ) , and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely  
of the supporting cast members , angelina jolie as memphis' former love is in the film just to provide eye candy ( she's definitely the hottest looking grease monkey i've ever seen ) and robert duvall as memphis' former mentor is just around to lend the film some class  
also , i'm a big fan of will patton ( armageddon , the postman ) and would love to see him get a huge role someday  
none of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately  
some underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles  
delroy lindo ( get shorty ) shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis , as does timothy olyphant ( go ) as lindo's partner  
i just wish some of the other characters could have been as important  
the only real gripe i have about the film though is its conclusion    
mainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll  
there's no doubt in anyone's mind that the 50 cars will be successfully stolen , and the filmmakers blew a perfectly good opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the "" rival car thief "" plot line  
as it stands , that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in a tidy little package  
but if i was making this film , i'd have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis and his crew , thereby making memphis have to improvise    
thereby adding some meat to the plot  
the finale is essentially just a big car chase , and there just aren't ways to make car chases interesting anymore  
it's all been done  
the chase is also shot and edited in that "" jerry bruckheimer action sequence "" kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene  
sure it's a car chase , but what exactly are the particulars of it ? 
it's very hard to tell  
finally , there's a stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the "" bus jumping the ramp "" sequence from speed in the "" oh , i don't think so  "

1,"after the simple looking little spacecraft lands in a automobile wrecking yard , out steps a steel-gray , human-like creature with aquamarine eyes and clad in a muscular suit  
spencer , the boy who observes this , having seen his fill of science fiction flicks , figures this thing must be a robot from outer space  
with the exception of disney and a few others , most studios view children's films as a way to ship a cheap and unimaginative product and thereby make a quick profit  
star kid stands out as that rare kids' film that is undoubtedly low-budget but is also highly imaginative  
remember , the robot ? 
it wasn't one at all but rather a "" phase one assault cyborsuit  "" 
the cyborsuit is actually a prototype combat enhancer developed by the trelkins and jettisoned for latter retrieval when they are under attack from the invading broodwarriors  
the significant twist in the story is that spencer gets to go inside the cyborsuit , and the cyborsuit , nicknamed cy , has plenty of spunk  
cy keeps questioning the kid about everything including words like "" cool  "" 
upon hearing that "" command , "" cy starts rapidly decreasing the temperature in the cyborsuit until spencer screams for him to stop  
and when cy speaks , we see spencer's view , the backside of cy's lips and eyes  
as 12-year-old spencer , joseph mazzello from the jurassic park film series gives a remarkably good performance as a wimpy and initially tongue-tied kid  
even when enclosed in his powerful new cyborsuit , he has his fears but he learns to overcome them  
 "" if you run away , things don't get better , whether it's bullies , spiders , or girls , "" his science teacher advises him after he has difficulties dealing with all three  
turbo ( joey simmrin ) , the school's chubby bully , beats up on him , spiders frighten him , and , most embarrassing of all , he can't speak when in the presence of his would-be girlfriend  
with his cyborsuit on , he learns some bravery that transcends his time inside cy  
spencer lives with his dad and his older teenage sister stacey , played by a smart-mouthed ashlee levitch , who looks like a younger sarah jessica parker  
stacey derides her brother , whom she barely tolerates , by referring to him only as "" the fungus  "" 
this whole setup for spencer's downtrodden and delightfully funny life makes his acquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirth and empowerment  
the beauty of mazzello's performance is that you can vicariously experience his fear and share in his enjoyment when he goes after the bully to teach him a lesson he'll not soon forget  
the ensuing mayhem has some of the home alone antics , but the slapstick is kept tightly under control by writer and director manny coto so that one never feels embarrassed to be laughing  
the romantic angle is handled ever so delicately  
when cy wishes to know if spencer wants to mate with the object of his desire , michelle ( lauren eckstrom ) , his eyes open wide in revulsion  
 "" mate with her ! "" 
spencer exclaims  
 "" pllllleeeeease , i just like her that's all  "" 
the show has many funny twists  
in one , cy sees a man in a barney-like costume and begins firing at him , thinking he is an alien life-form  
soon things get way out of hand , and cy and spencer have to beat a hasty retreat  
as proof positive of the show's class , it actually contains tasteful bathroom humor -- thought that was an oxymoron in a kids' picture , didn't you ? 
cy cannot allow spencer to leave the cyborsuit , and what happens when he needs to urinate becomes both sweet and hilarious  
the director's staging of this sequence is one of the film's more charming moments  
oh , and eating is pretty funny too  
spencer , whose idol is the comic book character "" midknight warrior , "" gets to face the challenge of a lifetime when a broodwarrior comes to capture the cyborsuit  
spencer's valiant battle gives him a chance to find his mettle  
and the action sequences in the battle manage to be quite respectable for a kids' show full of inventiveness and lacking the usual repetition  
for a family movie mixing humor , fantasy , and action , star kid delivers  
although it's probably not the sort of movie you'd want to see without kids , with them you'll have a magical time with a relatively straightforward but well developed story  
you'll be rooting for and laughing with spencer and his buddy cy all the way through  
star kid runs 1 : 41  
it is rated pg for fantasy combat  
although the basically cartoonish broodwarrior might scare the littlest kids , i saw none of this in evidence in our packed screening , so i would say the show is fine for kids five and up , and possibly the younger ones "

1,"after a stylistic detour with mrs  
parker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption  
while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie  
it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it  
until mrs  
parker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies  
i found equinox , his last pre- mrs  
parker effort , to be irritating and frustrating  
i was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow  
there are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach  
the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch  
in short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in  
afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples  
jeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle )  
for her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level  
all she's interested in is seducing him during those few days when she's ovulating  
after he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor  
the other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they're no more content than jeffrey and marianne  
a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart  
they remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won't allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs  
the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable  
the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey  
the two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn't take long before they're lounging together , naked , in her pool  
meanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains  
the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love  
sex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness  
ultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves  
the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances  
jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman  
those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity  
lara flynn boyle , who wasn't impressive in rudolph's equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability  
nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph's most pregnant lines with practiced ease  
the clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary phyllis  
her often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film's humor , and there's hardly ever a moment when she doesn't steal the spotlight from her co-stars  
i don't know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director's earlier productions  
enough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters  
afterglow is basically a four-pronged character study  
the plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that's the real reason to see this motion picture  
rudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction "
1,"if you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child , would you do it ? 
 "" gattaca "" is a film which presents a future where society has answered "" yes "" to this question , but then ponders if this was actually the right decision  
 "" gattaca "" came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature , the lovable dolly the sheep , and with this in mind , the film only becomes more frightening  
the way the realm of genetics is heading , it may only take a couple decades until the future "" gattaca "" presents becomes true  
contrary to the misleading trailers , "" gattaca "" is not a sci-fi thriller , in the way that there's lots of murder , hitchcockian suspense , and chase scenes  
this is a quiet , sad film about intelligent theories  
in fact , the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley ( the latter who's novel "" brave new world "" featured genetically engineered children )  
it's a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia , which is exactly what "" gattaca "" presents    and the main reason i dug it so much  
the story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) , a man with high hopes but a 90% chance of heart problems , and a prospected life span of around 30 years  
as a child , he was put down because of the threats of genetics , while his younger genetically perfect brother , anton ( loren dean ) , was promised whatever his heart desired  
vincent yearns to be an astronaut , but when he gets a job at a giant space company , it's as a janitor ( ernest borgnine plays his boss ! )  
but one day , he finds out that it's probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist ( or something ) , german ( "" wings "" ' tony shalhoub , who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in '97 : "" men in black , "" "" a life less ordinary ""    ) , who's client is a genetically perfect man , jerome morrow ( jude law ) , who has unfortunately been crippled  
fortunately , though , there's no record of the accident , and he's willing to give someone else his life  
since vincent looks a bit like him    
after a couple alterations ( some minor , some really major ) , he has donned the life of jerome , and is doing his job  
there , he meets a genetically imperfect woman , irene ( uma thurman , who's genetically perfect in real life anyway , hee hee ) , and the two begin a kind of relationship , albeit a very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a man's stats are  
however , a murder of a high-level worker at his office is killed , and one of vincent/jerome's eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semi-wily inspector , hugo , ( alan arkin ) , and none other than vincent's long lost brother , anton , who hasn't seen him since they were teenagers  
we know vincent/jerome didn't do it , but with his older picture being posted everywhere , not only vincent/jerome's in trouble , but also the real jerome , who's as much in it as he is  
however , there isn't many big suspense set pieces , which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in , the film would lose it's message and descend into just being a sci-fi thriller a la william gibson  
the suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin  
while there are several scenes which are pretty frightening , there are no big distractions from the point of the film , much to the dismay of commercial audiences  
what is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created  
irene has no real spunk in her life , and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people  
and the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man , claiming that his accident was really no accident  
what jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that , and the ending is shocking as it's a definite work of dystopian propaganda , but doesn't have the down ending of other works of this kind  
the production design of this film is probably the best i've seen this year : it's stunning , very pleasing to the eye , but still very cold  
since genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement , the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity , and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery  
and the sequence of all the high-level workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliam-esque feel to it , showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine zombie-like life  
the ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy  
the acting from everyone is great , with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance , and hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway ( interesting pointless fact : uma and ethan started dating after this film , and currently she is pregnant with his child )  
but the best performance belongs to jude law , who steals every scene he's in , and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden  
i think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child , but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something i'm not sure of "

the previous two "" alien "" films have each had their own unique styles to them  
the ridley scott's alien was very much a stylistic suspense film  
james cameron's aliens was much more of an action film  
and i liked each film separately for which it was  
now alien 3 is out  
and it is it's own film in the same right that alien and aliens were  
unlike aliens , alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens  
this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off  
the survivors of the expedition to lv-426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens  
the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item , an egg  
in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch , find its quarry , which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured , an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel  
this vessel crash lands on fury 109  
everyone in the vessel is killed , except ripley  
the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash  
fury 109 is an ex-mining/maximum security prison  
when closed down , some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet  
all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years  
ripley's arrival sparks a problem with the inmates  
as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner's sport , there is an infestation of lice on the planet  
being an ex-prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons  
so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own  
i will not go into detail , but you can guess what happens here  
the alien is loose and no one believes ripley's outstanding story  
she finds comfort in the arms of the colony's doctor  
yes , after 57 years ripley has sex  
it is not gratuitous , in fact , we don't even see them kiss , but it is just as well  
a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film  
there is a lot more gore in alien 3  
in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two  
it also sports a new alien with 4 legs ! 
i won't say how , but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle , which i am sure will be explored in alien 4  
sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character  
her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination  
the rest of the cast is also quite good  
notably , charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109  
alien 3 has a very distinct look  
this is due largely to its director , david fincher  
mr  fincher , who until now has only directed music videos and commercials , has done an incredible job here  
his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no "" alien "" film has before "
1,"clue is an unfairly ignored comedy , very similar to 1976's murder by death  
this big screen version of the classic board game ( what's next    
chutes and ladders : the motion picture ? ) is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue  
the plot , for what it's worth , has all the characters from the game ( in this case , the names from the game are used as aliases ) meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr  boddy ( lee ving ) , the man who's been blackmailing them all  
when he turns up dead , everyone ( including the audience ) must figure out whodunnit    
and in what room , and with what object  
while not as witty as neil simon's murder by death , clue definitely has it moments  
it has so many moments in fact that i use a lot of the lines from the film when i'm joking around with my friends  
to this day , whenever someone says the phrase "" well , to make a long story short "" i have the follow up phrase "" too late "" ready to go  
the cast ( all very good comedic talents ) play well off one another , while the late madeline kahn ( as the dark and sultry mrs  white ) sometimes steals the film away from the rest  
and colleen camp , as the french maid yvette , displays some of her natural talents as well  
clue is available on dvd from paramount home video  
it includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1  85 : 1 ( and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) and features the original theatrical trailer  
a french language audio track is also available  
the trailer holds up well considering most previews from that time do not , and it even includes a scene not in the film itself ( a scene that should have been in the film , as it's a good joke )  
also , the trailer is scored to the music from airplane ! , which was an interesting choice  
when clue played in theaters , it ran with the gimmick of three different endings  
if you wanted to see all three , you had to go to the movies three separate times  
so when the film was released on home video , rather than releasing three separate videos , all three endings were included on one tape    
the first two endings being "" what if ? "" 
endings and the third ending being the actual ending  
now for the dvd release you get two choices  
you can watch the film as it was presented on home video or you can select to watch it with one of the three endings randomly chosen for you  
 ( note : there's an easter egg hidden in the disc pertaining to this  
after watching the film with a randomly selected ending , when you return to the menu screen you will be able to highlight the large magnifying glass and select it  
when you do , a secret menu opens , allowing you to watch any of the three endings by themselves  ) 
now while i applaud the effort of paramount here , as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc , it just doesn't work well  
first , why not give the viewer the choice of what ending we want to watch ? 
maybe someone like myself who's seen the movie hundreds of times would like to sit down and show it to someone with the second ending only  
i'm no technical dvd expert , but i can't imagine that being too hard to accomplish  
secondly , the delay between when the film itself ends and one of the endings begins is too long and too obvious , thereby becoming a distraction right when you definitely don't need a distraction  
finally , the back of the dvd case states "" and now , with this special dvd version , you can see all 3 surprise endings "" "

1,"i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean's war picture  
i still think that it doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies  
and i think that lumet's "" 12 angry men "" , wilder's "" witness for the prosecution "" and kubrick's "" paths of glory "" would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958  
but i can't deny the importance of "" the bridge on the river kwai "" - cinematically and in its contents  
the film is set in burma in 1943  
a bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai  
but the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn't work as simple workmen  
struggling toughly , col  nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col  saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect  
afterwards col  nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge  
he considers it an opportunity to raise his men's morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese  
but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins )    
a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people  
they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge  
and the film doesn't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in "" paths of glory ""  
lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies  
this is also perceptible in the conversations between col  nicholson and col  saito  
in this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is a somehow unpleasant person in the film  
the audience is supposed to applaud col  nicholson's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not  
the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col  nicholson takes for his men  
 ( the plot by-passes these risks  ) 
that means , the picture isn't perfect  
but it has a lot of virtues as well  
it shows the "" madness "" of war and what war can produce in people's minds  
it shows how col  nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics  
and "" the bridge on the river kwai "" is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests  
these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme )  
david lean's effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense , especially in the dramatic ( though not wholly plausible ) showdown  
alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col  nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character "

1,"there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor's effort  
often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile  
when one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders  
but sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with "" the hurricane  "" 
this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin "" hurricane "" carter would normally be called "" norman jewison's 'the hurricane , ' "" as per the tradition of referring to a film "" belonging "" to a director  
but though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of "" the hurricane , "" because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington  
washington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late-night shooting in a bar  
jailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals  
the situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter  
through the efforts of that group and carter's lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted  
the film details carter's childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya )  
when he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide  
despite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned  
flash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african-american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison  
the book , entitled "" the sixteenth round , "" opens young lesra's eyes to the injustice that was carter's life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer  
lesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal  
 "" the hurricane "" leans on denzel washington  
he must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly  
it's probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter , because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be  
it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the film  
the actor's work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm's length  
we feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost  
washington's is a performance of weight and emotional depth  
he doesn't merely play angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level  
his work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor  
norman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection  
 "" the hurricane "" moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely  
jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is , and nothing is terribly confusing  
his boxing scenes , constructed with clear inspiration from "" raging bull , "" get inside the action very well , and they are believable as real sports footage  
jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform , and jewison , assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington , shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude , and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell  
jewison's best achievement in "" the hurricane "" is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard-knock life , and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again  
sadly , though , the film's chief failures lie with the screenplay , as with most of the good-but-not-great efforts to round the pike this winter  
there is much to interest a viewer in "" the hurricane , "" but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich ? d route possible , it does  
take a look at the supporting characters , for example , who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil  
carter and lesra ( played nicely by shannon , who deserves credit ) are the only real people here ; everyone else is a stereotype  
the canadians are good  
the cops are bad  
the canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey-dovey commune ( and it is a commune , despite the film's failure to make that clear ) , while every racist cop ( especially dan hedaya's ) melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room  
much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey ( "" hate put me in prison "

1,"i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files  
first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie  
the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable  
you have to reach for a larger audience  
therefore , the movie is quite user-friendly  
altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange  
but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on  
you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera  
in any case , the answer is no  
i am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium  
however , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie  
i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new  
everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others  
i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie  
warning : major spoilers follow ! 
please do not read , to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird "" hummm "" sound is all about  
you have been warned  
the x-files is what a summer should be  
exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances  
this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank  
from start to finish , this movie does not let go of you  
when i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon  
this flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes  
in fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue  
you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! 
the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid  
you know , when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? 
so yeah , the x-files is scary  
and guess what ? 
you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster  
do not think that the x-files is a monster movie  
in fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total  
no , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series  
scully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time  
she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much  
no , this is mulder's time in the spotlight  
by now , you have heard of the scene where mulder "" showers "" independence day  
if you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let's just say that due to recent events mulder should be "" showering "" godzilla instead  
to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there    who 
cares ! ? 
if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? 
the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous  
the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill "
1,"synopsis : private detective tom welles is hired by a wealthy widow to uncover the origins of a snuff film owned by her late husband  
after uncovering the authenticity of the film , welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers  
comments : 8 mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time  
though it doesn't present a snuff film ( a movie which documents a person's murder for real , usually during or after some form of sexual act ) as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as , say , natural born killers , 8 mm stays in your head long after you see it  
it is not fun to watch ; see something else if you get upset by realistic , sadistic violence  
this film's violence and perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc-17 territory  
for those with strong stomachs , however , 8 mm is an intelligent , worthwhile thriller , especially during its second hour  
nicolas cage , after a couple ho-hum movies , returns to material which allows him to utilize his strong acting abilities  
as tom welles , a private detective and caring family man to a wife and newly-born daughter , cage skillfully and convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession and violence as he is pulled into a nightmarish world of underground pornographers and brutal sexual deviants  
serving as a guide to this world is joaquin phoenix , who plays a struggling songwriter named max california  
california , despite his name , is a surprisingly intelligent and complex character , and phoenix does a very good job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character  
the real star of the movie , though , must be peter stormare  
stormare played the "" really , really evil guy "" in fargo , and his character , dino velvet , in this movie seems about ten times more evil and unpredictable  
his performance is very chilling  
8 mm's success may hardly be surprising  
it was directed by joel schumacher , who , hopefully , saw this film as an apology for the absolutely dreadful batman and robin  
before directing the last two batman duds , however , schumacher was responsible for several well-made horror flicks : lost boys , flatliners , and falling down  
8 mm certainly joins the rank of these minor classics and is perhaps most reminiscent of falling down in that both films present an average man who self-destructs before the audience's eyes  
8 mm was written by andrew kevin walker , who also penned the academy award-winning thriller seven a few years back  
like seven , 8 mm is full of dialogue which haunts you well after leaving the theater  
welles is searching for answers  
how could anyone possibly drug and then slowly , methodically , sadistically kill a teenaged girl to make a film ? 
when confronting one of the perpretrators at the end , the murderer responds that there are no reasons  
he just enjoys it  
that , walker seems to suggest , is where the real terror lays : not in the crime itself but in the fact that rational motives do not exist  
a couple minor faults led me to my four-star rating ( five stars is the highest rating i give )  
one , i found it a little difficult , early on , to accept the fact that a hardened private detective would get physically disgusted when first seeing a snuff film  
yes , snuff is a horrible thing , but a detective of welles' caliber has probably encountered awful things before  
second , some of the clues welles gathers are too convenient  
he discovers , for example , the victim's diary in her private bathroom , despite the fact the the police , the fbi , and her own mother have all investigated the room before  
finally , the closing scene seemed trite and improbable considering the rest of the film  
despite the above criticisms , 8 mm is an engrossing story  
one of the best scenes in the film occurs toward the end as a crazed welles , who no longer seems like a hero , brutally beats one of the pornographers responsible for the snuff film  
he pulls a gun on the man and , for a relatively long amount of time , struggles to decide whether or not to kill him  
he then leaves the building and calls the victim's mother , in the middle of the night , to basically see if she would support the action  
the entire scene is tense , unpredictable , and emotionally charged  
rarely , anymore , do horror films or thrillers provoke suspense in me as 8 mm , with scenes like this , did  
8 mm is most certainly not for the faint of heart  
this is a graphic , oftentimes unflinching , look into the darkness which resides in both ordinary and extraordinary people  
if you're prepared for a film of this nature , i give it an enthusiastic recommendation "
1,"there is nothing like american history x in theaters or on video  
no other feature film takes such a cold hard look at the lure , the culture , and the brotherhood of white supremacy  
nice guy ed norton jr  ( who sang in everyone says i love you ) plays derek , a twenty-year old skinhead  
dad's subtle racism grew large in derek , after gang members killed his father  
dad was fighting a fire when they shot him  
now derek keeps his head shaved and has a giant swastika tattooed over his heart  
derek is more interested in the ideas of white supremacy than in its culture of violence  
at a basketball court , black and white tempers flare  
derek channels the aggression into a game , black versus white , for ownership of the courts  
when the choice presents itself , derek goes for game point instead of the sucker-punch  
cameron ( stacy keach ) steps in to derek's life as a surrogate father  
he takes derek under his wing and nurtures his racist feelings  
keeping his own criminal record spotless , he uses derek as a leader and organizer for high-visibility racial intimidation  
derek obliges by leading his younger and dumber friends in race-motivated mob crimes  
at the bottom of the chain , derek's younger brother danny ( edward furlong , made famous in terminator 2 ) joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons , but because he admires his brother and he wants to belong  
one night three black youths break into derek's truck , which is exactly what derek has been waiting for  
outside in his shorts and his tattoo , he shoots them all  
the third would-be thief , unarmed , is only wounded  
in the key scene of the film , derek commands the kid into a position where he can be killed with one glorious , enraptured , awful stomp  
 ( the fun-spoiling nc-17 of orgazmo seems even more inappropriate , considering american history x was rated r  what sort of country is this that says sex comedies are a bigger threat to our youth than brutal , ecstatic violence ? ) 
the police arrive just as derek kills the last thief  
derek does not resist the cops , and as they spin him around to cuff him , the film slows down  
derek raises his eyebrows and smiles at his little brother in a chilling , sadistic , satisfied grin  
now in prison , derek faces new challenges  
as the black man in the laundry tells him , "" in the joint , you the nigra , not me  "" 
there is a clique of swastika-wearing skinheads , but they are not interested in the ideology of white supremacy  
they only use the symbols as a means of intimidation  
derek finds himself truly alone , truly in danger , and truly afraid  
when derek finally gets out of prison , he finds that his friends from the gang have also changed  
without derek's leadership , they have shunned the white supremacist ideology for the white supremacist culture  
it is the final factor that makes him realize how badly he's screwed up  
in the end , he spends quality time with is brother trying to undo the respect and admiration he had earlier inspired in danny  
the film ends a little too deliberately , too neatly after the unchained emotion and violent glee of the rest of the film , but it barely detracts from the overall experience  
edward norton gives an oscar-worthy performance  
although some of his dialogue seemed to be written without enough conviction , norton's performance compensated  
 ( an example that comes to mind is his pep talk before looting the store  ) 
he also captured the essence of an older brother  
he took his responsibility as a role model to his younger brother very seriously , very lovingly , both before and after his change of heart "

1,"in intolerance , d  w  griffith told four different historical stories at the same time , cutting from one to the other  
each of the stories builds to a fast-paced climax  
in magnolia , paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others  
yet the stories and where they are going are all independent  
what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized  
each story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment ) but then lets the tension dissolve  
while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along , even though they are not in the same scene  
then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again  
it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked  
this creates some strange effects  
the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships  
the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content  
we have the story of a dying man earl partridge ( jason robards ) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends  
phil parma ( philip seymour hoffman ) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal  
partridge's young wife linda ( julianne moore ) is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies , but for an unsuspected reason  
frank mackey ( tom cruise ) runs the kinds of self-help seminar that businesses like so much , but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit-heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women's lib  
officer jim kurring ( john c  reilly ) is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place  
jimmy gator ( philip baker hall ) hosts a popular children's tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector ( jeremy blackman ) and former quiz kid donnie smith ( william h  macy )  
the film juggles all these stories for over three hours , but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily  
each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax , but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story  
the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories  
the film seems to be built around strange events and weird history , but it really has little to do with the content of the stories , though they all are connected in part by one weird event  
magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson , though in my opinion his two previous films , hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories  
it is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson's company  
john c  reilly seems to be a standard fixture  
particularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight  
here he several of the characters are mesmerizing , but that characteristic is not really used  
as studies of characters these stories are each worth following  
as well-rounded stories with a beginning , middle and end , they leave something to be desired  
but the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through

1,"i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials , but there isn't  
george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant , special effects-bound flicks and he has done it again  
this is the first star wars film i've seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video  
what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story , but its amazing visuals  
basically , the film's plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets  
qui-gon ( liam neeson ) and his young apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) set out with the animated jar-jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war  
when their ship breaks down and they are stranded , they find a young boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his slave mother  
qui-gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing  
anakin participates in a heart-pounding podrace , one of the highlights of the film , to get the equipment needed to fix qui-gon's ship  
however , most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy  
meanwhile , queen amadala ( natalie portman ) is frustrated and at wit's end , being na ? ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders  
there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film- even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb  
this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made  
in all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not for uplifting purposes  
despite the fun of watching the movie , the phantom menace is not without flaws  
for starters , we have the ill-conceived , moronic character jar-jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience  
what a klutz ! 
george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as , say , yoda , r2-d2 , or c3-po , but , alas , his efforts were in vain  
secondly ( this may be good or bad , depending on your point of view ) , the movie's atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic-book feel of the previous three star wars installments  
this is due , perhaps , to the utter complexity to this movie's plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here  
the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions  
i can't say much about the acting , though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway  
however , there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances- they are straightforward and , at times , stale  
natalie portman has a great presence , but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic , unfeeling ? enigma  
there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance  
jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk  
despite the inevitable faults , there is so much to enjoy about the movie  
the heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn't quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes , but they are amazing and edge-of-your-seat fun in their own rite  
the film is a treasure to look at  
the visual effects are astonishing 99  8% of the time- the awe-inspiring , mouth-opening , eye-popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius  
not since 1997's the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one  
the production design is reminiscent of the fifth element , the previous star wars movies , kubrick's 2001 , maybe even of fritz lang's classic silent metropolis  
however , all the sets are so original  
the original star wars movies can't even match the grandeur of this film's visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer- it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode  
the costumes are remarkable and have jean-paul gaultier written all over them  
whether its queen amadala's gigantic wardrobe complete with gold-embroidery and feathers , or the jedis' simple brown uniforms , the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness  
the costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie  
as for john williams' score , i don't think he's done one as complex or powerful since ? i can't even remember  
it is as epic as his schindler's list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws "

1,"the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster 
the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman 
the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider  
when those observers are joel and ethan coen , the surreal becomes bizarre  
when the life is that of jeff "" the dude "" leboswki , the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of "" what'sgoingonaroundhere ""  
the marvelous sound of "" the stranger "" ( sam elliot ) 's voice-over introduces the film  
at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up  
the dude ( jeff bridges ) is described as the "" laziest man in los angeles , possibly the world "" , although he's not so much slothful as he is relaxed  
spending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doesn't have much of a life , but he's having a good time  
when asked what he does for fun , he responds "" bowl , drive around and the occasional acid flashback ""  
lebowski's passion is bowling  
when he's not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike , things just happen to him  
arriving home one night , he's beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them  
even worse , they urinate on his rug  
the problem is that the dude doesn't have a wife  
his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment  
the "" big "" lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionaire and his dudeness lives in two-room squalor  
the next day , our ragtag hero visits his namesake's mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug  
the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it's virtually the only object there  
when he's denied any money , he picks up a replacement rug off the floor  
on his way out , he runs into lebowski's trophy babe wife bunny ( tara reid ) who offers to perform a sexual act that , according to rumor , is one of bill clinton's favorites for a thousand bucks  
the penniless dude wisecracks that he's heading for the cash machine  
later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny's kidnappers  
this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes-gone-wrong sequences  
the kidnappers are impossibly inept  
the dude and his cronies are even worse  
every plan goes awry  
you can almost see lebowski's brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues  
that's the story , but to tell the truth it doesn't much matter  
there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining  
the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into  
the dude's bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you'd see on the street but , like everything else in this film , they're not quite what they seem  
walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties  
everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam  
when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won't admit it , walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet  
donny gets precious few words in between walter's screaming and the dude's rambling  
when he does , walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns  
donny is "" out of his league "" and doesn't "" have a frame of reference ""  
the film is peppered with people for whom the term "" character "" would be an understatement  
the big lebowski's daughter maude , an avant-garde "" vaginal "" artist , paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s&m mary martin  
the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers "

1,"titantic , writer and director james cameron's much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ? 
as a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful  
if you've already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again  
the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world's most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers  
in either case , it is filmmaking at its best  
when we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long  
he said no but that the time would go by so fast she'd never notice the length  
amazingly , he was right  
titanic is one of the few long films that doesn't suffer because of it  
the lush picture , filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm , opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean  
fortune hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) leads the expedition looking for the world's most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship , known back then as "" the ship of dreams  "" 
the necklace's hundred-year-old former owner , rose dewitt bukater ( gloria stuart ) , finds brock to tell him her story  
although almost all of the movie happens in flashback , one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk  
using a computer simulation , the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later , which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing  
after twenty minutes , the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage  
in a classic movie theme , the two parts of the ship , first class and steerage ( third-class ) exist in sharp contrast  
the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing  
entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance , cal hockley , played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane  
and thanks to a last minute winning poker hand , an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class  
even with her own promenade deck , rose feels trapped on the ship , what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes  
in contrast , jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board  
after jack saves rose from committing suicide , they start a brief but impassioned love affair  
never tawdry and rarely explicit , their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story  
leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma  
in so many ways , small and large , he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part  
when he confronts cal , for example , he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal's supercilious put-downs  
kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose  
the chemistry between these two academy award nominees , him for what's eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility , is nothing short of astonishing  
from the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship's bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude , they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances  
if the film breaks after an hour and a half , which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up , you will still get one of the best films of the year  
peter lamont's sets are more than authentic  
one scene , for example , starts with the planning-to-retire captain , played with insouciance by bernard hill , having his tea on deck  
it then shifts to the ship's massive gears and then to the bright-hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals  
the handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner  
easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest  
at first , since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull , not some big gaping hole , the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else  
what a lark  
we've struck an iceberg  
now let's get back to our brandy and cigars  
the ship's musicians play like troopers through it all , even after the panic sets in "
1,"are you tired of all the hot new releases being gone by the time you get to the video store ? 
wafflemovies  com is dedicated to finding those hidden gems that lie on the shelves  
everyweek , wafflemovies  com 
reviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video  
here is a sample review : 
welcome to sarajevo 
in light of america's recent intervention in kosovo , welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years  
set in sarajevo 1992 and based on actual events , this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war  
the picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding  
as they make their way down the street , a sniper shoots the mother of the bride  
yet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war  
in this scene , we meet joe flynn ( woody harrelson ) , an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church  
joe is cocky , but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesn't even know  
his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson ( stephen dillane )  
michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the world's lack of interest  
henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mother's death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread  
he decides to take action when a united nations' delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth  
henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines  
he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult  
during his visits , he befriends a pre-teen girl , emira ( emira nuseric ) who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner  
he promises to get emira out of harm's way if he gets the chance  
after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children , henderson loses hope  
however , his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina ( marisa tomei ) and her children's aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans  
unfortunately , only babies are wanted for adoption , so henderson pledges to take emira to england  
the group of children , nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy  
can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps ? 
the movie was beautifully and sensitively made  
director michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred  
they show the destroyed lives , families that have been split up , and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with  
this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson , his producer and flynn have befriended  
the group of twenty-somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life's simplest pleasures and amenities  
one of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth  
like the rest of those deeply effected by the war , this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live  
winterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room  
the picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the 1984 olympics  
winterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities  
this portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies  com 
selection mad city  
we watch them struggle to cover the horror , while trying to remain professionally detached  
however , they are human and question the reason behind it all , why no one cares , and how they can get out  
stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson  
he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events "
1,"mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence  ) 
with three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest "" hot properties "" in action adventure stardom , and it's just about time  
for over twenty-five years , jackie's been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy  
 "" drunken master "" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to "" make it big "" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong  
i'm not entirely sure why , exactly  
in many ways , "" drunken master "" is similar to most of jackie's other early films , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii , "" master with cracked fingers "" , "" half a loaf of kung fu "" , "" spiritual kung fu "" , and others  
in fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories  
to be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste  
they're quite different from action movies as we know them in america  
these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together  
 "" drunken master "" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception  
 ( as an aside , "" drunken master "" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen    in 
a movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival  
at the time , i didn't really think it was anything special    but 
after having seen more films like it , it's kind of grown on me  ) 
 "" drunken master "" 's storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii and "" master with cracked fingers "" --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been "" adapted , "" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid )  
more specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka "" naughty panther , "" a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough  
after embarrassing his instructor's assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can    and 
is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively  
his father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages  
kei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all  
while escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more  
this turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu  
he assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up  
then , when he's ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu  
unfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them    
 "" drunken master "" features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others  
it's been said before , but i'll say it again--these fights don't just _happen_ , they're as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows  
in his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways  
the fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films  
whether jackie wins or loses , it's really something to see "

1,"countries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously , had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally  
luckily , movie reviewers aren't burdened with such legislation  
otherwise , small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer  
in case of star wars , 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas , the consequences would be even more severe , because that film is very special for tens of millions , if not hundreds of millions of fans  
in any case , objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews , because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best , if not the best film of all times  
those who don't usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery  
the author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold , objective standards in reviewing this film  
like so many previous reviewers , i must note that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago , and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever since  
perhaps it was childlike fascination with , until then unimaginable , wonders that happened long time ago , in a galaxy far away  
or perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the opening shots , with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation i had read before  
anyway , watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life  
and it was also unmatched for many years to come , because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas' epic  
star wars wasn't just important movie for me ( or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment )  
it was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema  
until than , american motion picture industry was in a limbo ; social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood , and new authors filled the void , mostly by using hollywood's financial and technical resources to create serious , "" personal "" or "" artsy "" movies  
as a result , audience , traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate , didn't want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen  
george lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue  
the audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm , and huge financial success of the movie , later backed by supplement industry of toys , books , comics , role playing games and other merchandise , slowly began to change the face of hollywood  
serious , adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion , and were replaced by industrial products of "" blockbuster "" philosophy  
one of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre  
until 1977 , science fiction movies were mostly in b-production domain  
in late 1960s , bigger budgets for science fiction didn't look so strange anymore , thanks to the great success of 2001 : a space odyssey  
but the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism , and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production - mostly dark , dystopic movies  
however , in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies , even among the audience that usually doesn't like it  
as a result , seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away , although some good , dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s  
after that , science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment  
ironically , the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of "" new hollywood "" generation of young movie authors who made "" artsy "" and "" personal "" films in early 1970s  
george lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 , and nostalgic drama american graffiti  
both movies were considered "" personal "" in its time , despite latter one becoming very popular  
in a sense , star wars is an also very "" personal "" film , and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it , not for it  
but unlike many "" personal "" movies of the era , its "" personality "" was in line with the wishes of the general audience  
the plot , set "" a long time ago , in a galaxy far away "" , begins in a time of civil war  
the evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic  
in order to quash any opposition , the empire had built death star , superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets  
the information about death star , acquired by rebel intelligence , is being transported by princess leia organa ( carrie fisher ) when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser  
princess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader ( played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones ) , but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots - c3po ( anthony daniels ) and r2d2 ( kenny baker )  
those two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot  
his adventure begins when r2d2 escapes , because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi ( alec guiness )  
old man is actually the last surviving jedi knight , member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force "

1,"the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam  
 ( fitting , since the media-saturated gulf war became a pop entertainment  ) 
while driving through a long , flat iraqi desert ( in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament ) , one of the men under special forces sgt  
maj  archie gates' ( who's steering ) command requests a beach boys tune  
these men want their apocalypse now moment , only instead of surfing , they bop to the music and skeet shoot out the back of the vehicle , armed with automatic rifles  
our three kings ( okay , four ) are good fighters , but they don't necessarily take operation desert storm seriously-it's a reprieve from their hellish day jobs  
they are gates , new father sgt  
troy barlow ( wahlberg ) , sgt  
chief elgin ( cube ) , and pvt  
conrad vig ( music video director jonze )  
at story's start , president bush has declared a ceasefire , and american troops are tying up loose ends  
barlow , elgin , and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an "" ass-map "" that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion  
gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation ; he proposes-demands-that barlow , elgin , and vig join him on a treasure hunt  
ditching his escort , a relentless reporter named adriana cruz ( nora dunn ) , is easy  
so is finding the treasure , until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq : saddam's men are threatening the dictator's detractors ( citizens of his own country ) with violence  
when gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck , ready to loot , the unarmed rebels want help  
 ( bush encouraged them to rise up against the government , but provided no military support for such cause  ) 
gates convinces the vault's guards that this is a post-war mission , and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck  
the situation could go off without a hitch : the former enemies bear no grudges  
but the money hungry gates has a conscience , and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene , he orders barlow , elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces  
the result : barlow is kidnapped , and the filmmakers imply that these would-be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime  
barlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking device  
his interrogator lost his family to the bombs , and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child  
 ( he does , in chilling , lasting images  ) 
i liked these scenes best , because the political became personal  
it's one thing to champion the plight of thousands ; it's another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib  
russell has shocked us before : his first film , spanking the monkey , is about a young man's affair with his bedridden mother  
 ( it's great  ) 
his second , flirting with disaster , features a character who has an armpit fetish  
one could argue that it's easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions , though ; russell disturbs us in three kings by being no-nonsense about the violence  
when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home , russell mutes the sound-we're paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast  
three kings is russell's first visually arresting picture  
stylistically , it stands apart from other war dramas  
newton thomas sigel's cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy , which is , of course , entirely appropriate  
one practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen  
 ( a friend enthusiastically added , "" it's like having sand in your eyes  "" ) 
this also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade

1,"contrary to the title , "" the boxer "" is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics  
it's actually three movies in one : a political film , a boxing film , and a love story  
all of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story , but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal  
we've seen it all before , and we're just not blown away with it like we should be  
oh well  
it's still an excellent irish story  
 "" the boxer "" of the title is danny flynn ( jim sheridan staple daniel day-lewis ) , an ex-ira member who gets out of a belfast prison after 14 years , and finds out that his troubles are far from over  
first off , the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill ( brian cox ) , and one of its sub-leaders , harry ( gerard mcsorley ) , both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail  
while this is going on , danny and his old drunkard buddie , ike ( ken stott , who played the chief inspector in danny boyle's "" shallow grave "" ) , re-open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects , protestant and catholics , to work together  
danny not only begins teaching kids how to box , but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison , and is ready to start boxing real people again  
and danny runs into his ex-love , maggie ( "" breaking the waves "" 's emily watson ) , who hasn't seen him since he went in  
they don't easily start up their romance again because she's the wife of a prisoner whom she married during danny's tenure in prison , and also has a son , liam ( ciaran fitzgerald ) , from him , whom liam is hoping will get out soon  
but the two are slowly re-drawn to eachother again , and this begins to complicate things  
the political story is nothing really special but works in itself  
we've seen it many a time before , but it's at least interesting , sometimes emotional , and even riveting at times  
there's a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty  
the boxing story is very minor to the story , but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly , and even with good sportsmanship  
there are only a few boxing scenes , but they're never like "" raging bull "" /let's-strip-down-the-sport-to-its-bones brilliant  
they're more realistic , and instead of bone crunching , we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother , which is slightly unerving at times  
and i didn't know daniel day-lewis was in such good shape  
but the backbone of the story is the love one  
because these characters are given such horrible circumstances , and since the two leads have such great chemistry together , we really feel for their plight  
as the film goes on , and circumstances get worse and worse , the characters have to make real human decisions , and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters  
this is how you write a love story - take note , hollywood  
these elements are pretty much equally balanced , with each of the parts of the stories working hand-in-hand with eachother  
i loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered , and sometimes spilled over into the next  
it made sure that we didn't just care for one of them  
i'm not saying they're all equally great , because the love story really carries the film , but at least they all work out respectively  
the acting is amazing , with day-lewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry  
i'm not sure if they're oscar-nominee bound , but they're very good  
in the supporting roles , billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers  
but the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike , who is just a great scene stealer  
the direction and co-writing by jim sheridan ( with the other co-writing credit going to terry george ) is excellent , rounding out the characters well , but not pacing everything greatly  
i noticed that the first half was very leisurely ( yet fascinating ) , but the second half whirls by at a quick pace , and ends much too quickly  
more time could have been spent thinking up the ending , since it does seem quite sloppy  
though "" the boxer "" is a good film , it never achieves the greatness that it should  
sure , it's a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get , but on it's own , it just could have been better  
but it still works out , gives us a great love story combined with a political and boxing drama , and features great acting  
even if it could have been better , this'll do "
1,"capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii , life in a japanese prison camp  
to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity  
the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone's taste  
 , +3 ( -4 to +4 ) 
more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way  
this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law  
during world war ii , of course , the one goal was winning the war  
this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal  
when the japanese had captured prisoners , they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal  
minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output  
while the germans , not known for their kindness in those days , had a 6% mortality rate among captured prisoners of war , the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27%  
the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad  
that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do  
the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day  
and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll  
in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany  
filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story , perhaps for fear of offending the japanese  
there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps  
certainly there was david lean's the bridge on the river kwai  
there were some low-budget british exploitation films and that was about it  
then there were tv series "" a town like alice "" and "" tenko  "" 
lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa  
it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university  
the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them  
the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad  
it turns out to be a grim joke , one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves  
beating and torture are commonplace events  
men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable  
however , unlike as in kwai , the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital , called by the prisoners the death house  
so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail-laying machine  
this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies  
the japanese believe that the individual is nothing , that conformity to group's norms is all that gives a life meaning  
conformity is purpose  
before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp  
if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story  
if the british ( with one american , by the way ) and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story  
it is neither  
it is a stirring and believable account of camp life  
the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow  
this serves a double purpose for cunningham "

1,"the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible  
people may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized , methodical hatred  
five concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days , the first documentary from steven spielberg's survivors of the shoah visual history foundation  
the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry  
as the introduction explains , even as germany started to lose the war , the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe  
in 1944 , hungary had the last big population of jews within germany's reach , and they became the last target of hitler's "" final solution  "" 
each of the five tells his or her story  
their stories are intercut chronologically , starting from normal life in pre-war hungary  
they recall the nazi invasion of hungary , being sent to "" work "" camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps  
they recall their horrible , precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald ; the deaths of their family and friends ; their loss of hope  
each recalls his or her unfathomable , eventual liberation  
and finally , the last days shows their cathartic , pained , modern-day return to their old homes and the camps  
needless to say , their stories are horrifying , amazing , and emotionally draining  
by themselves , the stories would be forceful testaments , but by cutting them in parallel , their impact is multiplied by five  
the last days is a talking-heads style documentary -- it's mostly pictures of people telling their stories , intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage  
in this kind of movie it's almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on-screen , but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific , or at least relevant , images to go with his subjects' narration  
the liner notes ( one of the many nice features of this dvd ) indicate that there is some never-before-seen historical footage in the last days  
it's not clear which scene it is  
it could be one of two that i hadn't seen before , both powerful  
one is rare color footage , shot by an american , of piles of victims in cattle cars  
there is something jarring , something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color , when so much of the footage from world war ii is in black and white  
another segment shows walking skeletons ; survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore  
there has been a glut of holocaust movies and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say  
but by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war , moll told a specific part of the story in a new way , in greater detail  
and i'm glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject  
the transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful  
x-mozilla-status : 0009f words for a holocaust documentary , but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring , when skies are blue and trees are green  
also , the movie was shot on 35mm film ( and not video ! ) , 
so the richness and detail are impeccable  
the dvd's features are plentiful and well-chosen  
there is a theatrical trailer for the movie , which is a great introduction to the subject matter  
there are about fifty still photos , both from the production crew and from the private collections of the survivors  
also , the disc has two complete versions of the movie ( widescreen and full screen ) , both on the same side  
one of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors ( plus one for the crew )  
you'd think outtakes would be inappropriate in a holocaust documentary , but they're not bloopers  
instead , they are solid , moving segments that were probably cut from the film only for length  
one of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film  
renee firestone ( one of the five ) spoke on camera with dr  hans m ? nch , a german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz  
firestone was aggressive , questioning the doctor about what his children thought "

1,"historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s  
for many critics , scholars and , most importantly , film producers , it was a thing of the past - something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black-and-white television and non-cgi special effects  
but in 1995 , same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago , there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor , producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre  
and , same as in the case of dances with wolves , he was awarded for his effort with "" oscars ""  
the name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson  
the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 )  
in his time , english king edward i "" longshanks "" ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by "" ius primae noctis "" and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights  
although english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn't care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack )  
murron's death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country  
through time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace's rag-tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge  
but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn't like to have a simple commoner as a national leader  
braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it wouldn't be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann  
however , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre  
the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism  
while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish  
this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand-to-hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven's ultra-naturalistic flesh & blood  
compared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays  
braveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down-to-earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics  
what makes braveheart "" larger than life "" is his protagonist  
mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero  
wallace is more than superior to his enemies , both physically and mentally , yet he is able to show his sensitive , more vulnerable side  
naturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s )  
however , even those who don't particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child  
because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes aren't as effective as they should be  
mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors  
most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema  
brendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman's general ) is also very good as wallace's trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy-stricken king john balliol  
david o'harra is very entertaining as wallace's irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken character of robert the bruce  
women in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one-dimensional french princess  
catherine mccormack as wallace's wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on  
from the technical point of view , the film is also very good  
photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen  
on the other hand , the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern-day instruments for period piece set in medieval times  
although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike , braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism  
the main reason for that was the fact that gibson , among many historical facts , chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of "" longshank "" 's son prince edward ( played by peter hanly )  
he is not only presented as a villain , but also as one of the less competent in villain's camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in "" politically correct "" hollywood  
to make things even more obvious , good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives' common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals  
however , although the message of this film might look right-wing , it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century  
according to that ideology , oppressed classes ( workers , peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and , as such , they are more radical , less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand , privileged classes ( aristocracy , bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges "

1,"if this keeps up , jane austen ( sense and sensibility , pride and prejudice ) may have to apply for posthumous membership to the screen writers guild  
yet another novel of hers has made the transition to the silver screen  
mansfield park is a turn of the century ( 18th century going on 19th ) story about love among the classes as well as an examination into proper society and family ties  
ten year old fanny price ( hannah taylor-gordon , jakob the liar ) , taken from her mother and father and the poverty in which they dwell , is sent to live with her aunt and the privileged class at mansfield park , under the stern patriarchal hand of her uncle , sir thomas bertram ( harold pinter , mojo ) 
spending her days reminded of her lower status , she also invents and writes fanciful stories during her private times  
fanny eventually grows to become a beautiful , intelligent , and engaging heroine ( quite unlike the original character which ms  austen originally penned in her novel  ) 
writer/director patricia rozema ( when night is falling ) is responsible for the textual changes  
from a purely dramatic perspective , the revision makes perfect sense and improves the film's audience appeal  
what ms  rozema has done is to infuse the main character with much of ms  austen's own personality by including excerpts from the author's journals , giving that dialogue to fanny  
the result is a central character that is immediately appealing  
as the grown fanny , australian actress frances o'connor ( all about adam ) does wonderfully textured work  
at times , ms  rozema has fanny address the camera directly to communicate many of the novel's more introspective observations  
this is a difficult device to work seamlessly into a period film and it is to ms  o'connor's credit that it works as well as it does  
the central theme which gives the story its legs in an old one    
whether it is better to marry for love or for social standing ? 
fanny has fallen in love with her cousin edmund ( jonny lee miller , plunkett & macleane ) who appears fond of her as well  
his attentions are soon divided as the stylish and socially acceptable mary crawford ( embeth davidtz , bicentennial man ) enters the picture along with her equally acceptable brother henry ( alessandro nivola , inventing the abbotts ) who eventually sets his romantic sights upon fanny  
while mary and henry are evidently less than sincere in their affections , their presence does provide the movie and the main characters with the necessary conflict that keeps our interest until the film's appropriately austen-like ending  
other thematic devices include a awkwardly inserted reference to the source of the wealth of mansfield park    
the slave trade  
there is also a hint of both lesbianism and incest but neither is carried very far and is soon forgotten  
the motivation for marriage remains the primary thematic thrust  
fanny's cousin , maria bertram ( victoria hamilton , persuasion ) is an example of one making a poor match , marrying a well-to-do fool who is able to make her comfortable , but never happy  
fanny's own mother , trapped in her chosen life of squalor warns fanny by admitting that her situation is due to the fact that she "" married for love  "" 
fanny , given those two terrible examples , and faced with the same choice is understandably indecisive as to which way to lean  
the spiritual answer , of course , lies in the middle of those two extremes  
marriage is not a cold , calculating decision based upon self-preservation  
neither is it a senseless decision made in the warm afterglow of a passionate embrace  
in the purest sense , marriage forms an insoluble union whereby two people agree to function as one  
 "" and said , for this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife : and they twain shall be one flesh ? "" 
matthew 19 : 5 [kjv] 
love and logic can be combined  
god's word contains both  
so does a marriage based upon his truth "
1,"alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters  
i saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i didn't like it  
of course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault  
in order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor  
james cameron's aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series  
i am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality  
many thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action  
both are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well-written  
as for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion  
perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped  
on the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn't see  
it was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh  
i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities  
don't get me wrong--i'm not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting  
however , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters  
as a result , alien 3's only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters  
we never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie  
there were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt  ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films  
the other character was dr  clemens ( charles dance ) , but because we like him , the inevitable occurs  
alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off  
the prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry  
without using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film  
an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card  
we see lt  ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments

1,"if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it's their predictable endings  
the devil's advocate has the atypical hollywood ending , when everything that should happen does  
unfortunately for the devil's advocate , this ending nearly collapses in on itself , and ruins the entire film  
nevertheless , the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment ( note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film )  
i don't think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan  
well , it does contain this element , but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that )  
the devil's advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session  
kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl  
he ends up with a not-guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo )  
he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury  
he accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife  
after proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer  
he graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god  
he is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck  
his life seems to be on the rise  
and of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline  
he is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment  
mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted  
meanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t  nelson ) who apparently murdered three people  
he spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane  
all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself  
after a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin's wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends  
a fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin's real father  
is it all just a big nightmare ? 
or is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin's life ? 
the devil's advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don't expect  
is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ? 
if so , the devil's advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early  
i went into the devil's advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got  
i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got  
but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn't like the ending ? )  
the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you  
films like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less  
we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way  
the devil's advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all  
if that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again  
as for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study  
the film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that )  
and then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur  
it was at this point that i felt cheated  
taking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film "

1,"there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have , but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason  
 "" good will hunting "" is about one of those people  
the will hunting of the ( horrible ) title ( let's face it , this film would be a bitch to title ) , played by co-writer matt damon , is a mathematical genius  
he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino  
and he works at mit    as the janitor  
one day , the professor of one of the most challenging courses , proffessor lambeau ( "" breaking the waves "" 's stellan skarsg ? rd ) , puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete  
the next day , it's already done on the board , but no one in his class claims to have done it  
so lambeau puts another problem on the board , this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove  
and , duh , it's done again  
of course , they catch the guy who did it red handed - will  
before lambeau can find will again ( he ran away when he caught him ) , will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court , and struck a police officer , so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements : a ) he work with him on math , and b ) he get some therapy  
after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another ( for a hypnotist , he fakes being under his spell , then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic , "" afternoon delight "" )  
finally , lambeau's old college roomate , sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , a psych professor , agrees to treat him , and the two begin a rocky relationship , as sean tries to get will to open up  
turns out will had a rough childhood , being abandoned , and placed in foster homes and what not  
it also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life ; he wants a challenge  
and that is to hang out with his buds ( including the other co-writer , ben affleck ) , and do honorable jobs , like construction  
is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky ? 
should this guy be forced to do something he doesn't want to do ? 
this appears to be one of the million questions in this film , which is jam-packed with greatness , but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should  
i'm not saying "" good will hunting "" is a bad film at all  
it's a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments , and lots of great things about it  
the acting is amazing , with two oscar-nomination-worthy performances from damon and williams , who have amazing chemistry together  
we also get some great support from stellan skarsg ? rd ( great name ) , ben affleck , and from minnie driver , who plays will's love interest , skylar  
there are tons of individual moments that i adored  
i loved all the comedy in the film , especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks , his various attempts at therapy , and of course , my favorite scene in the entire film , the one where he delivers a long , exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them  
i liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends  
there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch  
and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable  
like the break-up scene between will and skylar , will and sean's first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn't regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter  
however , the main flaw of the film is there's too much of everything , and not enough of it either  
the film tries for deeper relations between the characters , but they're sometimes either overwritten or underwritten  
take for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father/son as well as doctor/patient relationship going with out any problems , but when it tries to show them as equals , it falls on its face  
we hear how they went to the same town , and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times  
but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do  
also , will's relationship with his best friend , chuckie ( affleck ) , has a nice climax , but not enough rising action  
we see them joking around , but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them , it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one  
their relationship never goes beyond "" just best friends , "" and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more  "
1," "" if there's a beast in men , it meets its match in women , too  "" 
starring sarah patterson , angela lansbury , tusse silberg , david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter , from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus 
in recent years , there has been a trend in the field of fantasy : writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world , investing it with new life and energy  
in modern times , fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased ; they have become trite adventures involving leering witches , friendly dwarves , and cuddly talking animals  
but in their original forms , fairy tales have a dark , wicked edge  
crows tear out the eyes of cinderella's sisters , a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version  
hansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven  
writers have become fascinated by the bloodier , morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales , and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots  
before this trend was in vogue , angela carter--whose stories always have a dark , wicked , subversive edge--had been reinventing fairy tales for years  
in the company of wolves , she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood , enlivening it with werewolves , rolls royces , and a visit from satan  
the story is structured as a dream , occurring in the mind of rosaleen ( sarah patterson ) , an adolescent girl about whose 'real' life we learn very little  
within the dream , there are a number of inset stories , most told by dream-rosaleen's grandmother ( angela lansbury ) , and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing , suggestive ways  
the result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister , contemporary fairy tale  
i say "" surprisingly "" because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong  
and there are ways in which it does  
the performances are mediocre , except for lansbury's--she finds the right note for the prim , apple-cheeked granny , the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales  
the soundtrack , synth-heavy , reminded me of bad 80s horror movies , as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes  
probably state-of-the-art at the time , they are now laughable  
but jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film : he transcends the poor acting/music/effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic , of otherness  
one of the problems in adapting full-blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader , rather than being subjected to the 'realism' of the screen  
part of me would love to see an adaptation of 'the lord of the rings , ' but , on the other hand , i know that any filmmaker's recreation of ents , hobbits , and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind  
this makes jordan's accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me : he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sense of magic and mystery  
the somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur-reality  
the sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant  
the nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly  
the peasant village is rustic and cozy , the woods old and hoary  
this archetypal realm is the setting for a smart , subtle , literate script , a script which is as good as you'd expect from jordan ( himself an accomplished fiction writer ) and carter  
for carter , the cauldron of story is a witches' brew , bubbling over with primal ingredients : mist-shrouded forests , ancient graveyards , virginal girls and wise women , wolves with glowing eyes  
she adeptly blends them all together  
there is a symbolic richness to the film ; everything is permeated with a sense of significance  
the point of it all , i think , is to represent a girl's rites-of-passage on an unconscious , primordial level  
a night-journey through the forest , from the village to the grandmother's home , is the crux of the company of wolves  
 "" don't stray from the path , "" rosaleen is told , again and again , and the path is both literal and figurative : the path through the forest and the path of life  
staying on the path is the conventional approach suggested by rosaleen's elders  
carter and jordan , never conventional , explore what goes on when you leave the path  
those who stray will supposedly meet with a dark fate  
this fate is literalized in the dream as werewolves , but the werewolves connote many things : death , sex , knowledge  
if straying from the path leads to death , then it's not a good idea--but if that's what you have to risk to get sex and knowledge ( and therefore power ) , then maybe it's worth the risk  
when you leave the path , the world becomes a dangerous , ambiguous place , but it's full of potential  
and it's certainly more interesting than the disney version "

1,"why do so many children's films treat their target audience with utter contempt ? 
too many of those who write or direct for children's movies assume that the kids just can't handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues  
 "" the iron giant , "" which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as "" the simpsons "" and "" king of the hill , "" assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time  
 "" the iron giant "" holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that's enjoyable for both children and adults alike  
hogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine  
after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception  
he comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food  
after saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts  
because of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy  
realizing he can't just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr  ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time  
it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can't keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security  
he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth's house as a lodger  
meanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind  
 "" the iron giant "" is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn' t talk down to its audience  
the story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy  
it's very similar to the spielberg classic "" e  t  , ' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of "" the iron giant  "" 
the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg's film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy  
the film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one's ability to choose one's own fate  
hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero  
the final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won't give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed  
the animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after "" tarzan "" ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you're watching a cartoon  
the giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way  
the characters' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief  
fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother  
harry connick jr  does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv's "" frasier "" ) as an army general called in by agent mansley  
unlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn't ditched )  
dean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations  
even the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia  
a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won't mind , but "" the iron giant "" has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off  
the film isn't only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though  
it's also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy  
the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on "" the simpsons "" for many years  
a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to "" outlast "" one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever  
the film even takes some jabs at america's nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to "" duck and cover "" in the event of a nuclear attack  
 "" the iron giant "" has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing  
instead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with "

1," "" say , any of you know how to madison ? "" 
--- brad "" asshole "" majors ( barry bostwick ) shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show  
the story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend  
in the early 70's , stage actor turned first-time playwright richard o'brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b-movies he had grown up with as a child , set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design  
the result was the stage play the rocky horror show , which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england  
the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later , in october of 1974  
the film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975    
and immediately tanked at the box office  
whether it was because fox wasn't quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn't quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop  
it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters  
a year later , something entirely strange and magical happened  
prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film  
this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time  
word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show's life as the ultimate cult film was born  
for the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton  
brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed  
they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr  everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home  
remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance  
the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet-stocking wearing mad scientist dr  frank-n-furter ( tim curry )  
frank-n-furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood )  
as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank-n-furter's mad schemes  
little do any of them know that the doctor's handyman , riff-raff ( original author richard o'brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth  
going back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has  
if i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i don't think i would have known what to make of it either  
for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film  
by the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o'brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b-movies his film is based on  
when i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity  
it goes without saying that the "" time warp "" is the most popular song in the film  
even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song  
what those who haven't seen the movie don't know though , is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment  
my personal favorite is "" over at the frankenstein place "" , but "" dammit janet "" is also maddeningly catchy  
tim curry's vocals on the rocking tune "" sweet transvestite "" need to be heard to be believed  
the finale of the film , a big floor show staged by frank-n-furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets ( including barry bostwick    
frightening ! ) , features no less than four songs ( "" rose tint my world "" , "" don't dream it "" , "" wild and untamed thing "" , and "" i'm going home "" ) , all of which are immensely singable "

1,"i know that "" funnest "" isn't a word  
 "" fun "" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective  
but that's the word that came to me right after viewing "" chicken run  "" 
no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like "" that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! "" 
so to hell with webster's -- "" chicken run "" is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while  
i can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner  
the chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something  
living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box  
one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer  
rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs  tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan  
she orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , "" chickens go in ; pies come out  "" 
what sort of pies ? 
chicken pies , of course  
co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : "" creature comforts , "" "" the wrong trousers , "" and "" a close shave  "" 
the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures  
part of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new  
 "" the wrong trousers , "" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and "" a close shave "" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories  
but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived  
now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in "" chicken run  "" 
the plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement  
thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done  
part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? 
park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is  
but they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us  
another thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing  
there are references to "" the great escape , "" obviously , and "" stalag 17  "" 
the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both "" raiders of the lost ark "" and "" indiana jones and the temple of doom  "" 
there's even a nod to "" the blues brothers , "" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history  
the "" braveheart "" reference is a hoot if you catch it  
when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , "" chicken run "" is downright brilliant in its execution  
consider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of "" blair witch project "" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online  
out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome  
why ? 
because once you got past the thought that "" they're parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch' movie , "" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose  
they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing  
conversely , "" chicken run "" doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene  
if you've never seen "" indiana jones , "" the chase sequence is still fun  
even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character  
park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , "" chicken run "" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either  
enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , "" chicken run "" is that much richer  
the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them  
ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on "" absolutely fabulous "" ) nails it "

1,"the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber , the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse , and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest , little caper adventure entitled `where the money is  ' 
the elderly bank robber is henry ( paul newman ) , a famous criminal that was only recently caught  
he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune  
always the shrewd thinker , he begins working on a plan to get out of jail  
this involves years of studying buddhism and self-hypnosis  
when he is prepared to execute his plan , he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke  
now a seemingly twitching vegetable , he is temporarily transferred to a state-run home  
carol ( linda fiorentino ) is the nurse that cares for him  
she's a very bright person with a good heart  
yet , her life is a miserable waste of time  
the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars  
her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics  
worse , she's in a dead-end relationship with high-school sweetheart wayne ( dylan mcdermott )  
they became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom  
to her , this made sense long ago  
but now , it's a different story  
wayne seems equally bored with his life , but is content enough to stay put  
wayne's greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman  
carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients , but she's never been anywhere else and doesn't see many other opportunities in life  
however , when henry falls under her care , her outlook begins to change  
the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke  
carol , however , begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all  
maybe she can get through to him , and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away  
the opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry ? back to life  ' 
and what are some of carol's resuscitation techniques ? 
perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses  
if that fails , maybe she'll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20-foot high pier into the cold lake below  
when he finally comes out of his state of self-trance , the movie's direction changes , though it remains equally if not more entertaining  
carol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness  
she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy  
this , of course , puts wayne in an odd situation  
henry and carol's bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car  
henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash  
meanwhile , this is carol's ticket to a better life  
wayne is uncomfortable with the situation , but helps out nonetheless  
however , his lack of commitment threatens their success  
the heist sequence is suspenseful , well paced , and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong  
`where the money is' does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist  
newman is the real joy of the film , adroitly showing that at age 75 , he's still really hot stuff  
he possesses a sly smile , displays a dominating attitude , and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive "
1,"written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes ) 
directed by robert altman 
some time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel  
the novel was a summer smash , topping best-seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads  
the only problem : the novel wasn't very good  
it was far more pulp than pulitzer  
but the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller  
so he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen  
the director ? 
francis ford coppola  
the book , of course , was mario puzo's the godfather  
the rest , as they say in showbiz , was history  
by bringing up the godfather , i don't mean to suggest that robert altman's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness  
but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material  
can you get any more questionable than john grisham ? 
depends on whom you ask  
but there's no question that grisham's work grabs people  
like puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can of spam  
so something in grisham's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america's greatest living filmmakers  
the result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon  
>from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe  
this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch  
witness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear  
we roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone  
right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises  
pay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman  
this is what a great director can do for questionable source material  
the sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases  
magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office  
outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen  
driven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home  
there he learns more about mallory's life than he bargained for  
her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski-style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter  
magruder , perhaps influenced by mallory's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed - right after he sleeps with her , of course  
this simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end  
he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well  
but then dixon's crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger  
the cops won't lift a finger to help a liberal attorney  
his only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private-eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr )  
if this predicament wasn't bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos  
altman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh's performance holds the gingerbread man together  
an accomplished actor when he isn't directing himself in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives  
is his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness , or of egotism ? 
magruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it's too late "

1,"there must be some unwritten rule that states , one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom , even if it is a foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere  
in the exotic morocco of 1972 , a 25-year-old english hippie mother , julia ( winslet ) , of two sweet young girls , the 6-year-old lucy ( carrie ) and the 8-year-old bea ( bella ) , has arrived for a year's stay , with the self-absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband ( she is not officially married to him ) and her cold one-room london flat , and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech  
at least she says she is , as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers  
she has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn't seem like it's much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in  
drugs , a world-wide youthful phenomena during this period , where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the 'good life' cheaply , and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities , even though drugs are illegal there  
but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here  
in this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken  
even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons , to follow the mystical sufis , seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from  
the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud's grand-daughter , esther freud , who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister  
it is written by the director's brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie  
the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls  
with julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her , she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria ; so instead , she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar , bilal ( said taghmaoui )  
he becomes her lover , taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls  
the girls readily accept him , and there is no big-to-do made about their openly sexual relationship , but the girls really don't know what to make of the relationship  
it especially bothers bea , who is embarrassed by her mother's loose attitude and wants to go home  
things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village  
it seems only that bilal's charm is matched by his shiftlessness , as he has a wife who still lives there  
this scene didn't make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also  
but i doubt that  
the family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next , as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel  
lucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel , while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a 'normal' girl  
the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets  
kate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner , living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences , as many a drop-out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose  
the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film  
the only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn , a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves  
the family's travel , which is on the edge , has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting ; but , when she gets up , all there is , is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her  
that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her , is starting to wear thin in her thoughts  
it will dawn on her , when bea takes ill , as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her , whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence  
he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him  
the new guru is grounded in reality , something she is not grounded in , and seems to tell her what she couldn't comprehend from anyone else , even comforting her , by telling her that her tears are memories- a gift from god  
the film's weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia  
the storyline about a helpless single parent , detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby-boom generation had during their trip to morocco , who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism , a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers , contrary to the impression the film might give , seemed to pass her by  
her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep , at best  
she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn't have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey  
after all , the mystical trip is the journey  
the film's strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings  
bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity  
the little girls are precocious but they are lovable  
julia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn't know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them "
1,"look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future  
some sort of decision had to be made , and , for better or worse , it irrevocably altered the course of your existence  
>from time-to-time , everyone thinks about the roads not taken , and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different  
perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train , for example -- could have an equally profound , yet less obvious , impact  
maybe that's where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ? 
film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that's why there's no shortage of movies about this subject  
the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance  
these themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red  
however , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life  
in his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : "" [the idea is] rich and interesting ? that every day we're faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we're completely unaware  "" 
while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra's it's a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths  
the "" road not taken "" approach isn't just a plot device , either  
writer/director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses/catches a train  
the audience watches , with ever-growing fascination , how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family  
as her separate destinies diverge and then re-converge , she becomes two completely different individuals  
that woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit  
one day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day  
the scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform  
in scenario #1 , she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station  
on board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty  
minutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn )  
in scenario #2 , she misses the train and , shortly thereafter , is the victim of an attempted mugging  
she doesn't meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry's infidelity  
juxtaposed one against the other , while sharing many places , cues , and characters , the two stories proceed in parallel from there  
on one level , for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate , sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience  
but , for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting , a script with a few twists , and a great deal of genuinely funny material , sliding doors still fits the bill  
one of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences -- those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures , and those who could care less  
it shouldn't come as any surprise that the acting , at least from three of the four leads , is solid  
paltrow , who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same , yet gradually become much different , is the standout  
she plays both of her roles effectively and believably -- the shy , insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated , platinum-blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man  
john hannah , known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral , is instantly likable  
john lynch , taking a break from movies about ireland's troubles , does a good job presenting gerry as a inept , selfish philanderer  
only jeanne tripplehorn , who plays an over-the-top vixen , seems out of place  
her attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring , and it's occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element  
one member of the supporting cast deserves special notice  
douglas mcferran , who plays gerry's best friend , russell , is an absolute delight , stealing every scene that he's in  
part of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie  
on one occasion , he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy  
on another occasion , while laughing at gerry's plight with the women in his life , he comments , "" being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable  "" 
but it's not all in the dialogue "

1,"luckily , some people got starship troopers  
some people knew it was supposed to be silly  
for those of you who didn't , how could you miss it ? 
from the very beginning , when we see an interactive internet-like promotional video for the armed forces of the future , it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly  
i guess without blatant one-liners and home alone style slapstick , some people just don't recognize such goofy humor  
such a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned  
first thing to do before seeing this movie - lighten up  
meet the equivalent of "" beverly hills 90210 "" meets "" mighty morphin power rangers ""  
four close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces , which , in the future , means fighting for the whole galaxy and not just your country  
johnny rico ( casper van dien ) is ready to join the infantry , mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) has enlisted to be a pilot  
dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) has enlisted as a trooper , and it's possible she's joining merely to follow rico , whom she's always had eyes for  
if you saw these three on the street , you'd automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers , for never has a movie's cast looked so much like the cut-out cover of "" seventeen "" magazine  
the lone non-supermodel , carl jenkins ( played by doogie howser himself , neil patrick harris ) is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division , the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie - er , carl out of the picture  
 ( good call - now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters )  
right off the bat , rico becomes the star of the show , far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in a short period of time  
but a horrific accident during a standard training exercise ( which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen ) leaves rico ready to call it quits  
with his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on , johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home  
well sorry , rico suave , but there's no place like home , especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it  
that's right , the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnid-like alien beings that a can of raid just isn't going to destroy  
with a sudden change of heart ( and clothes ) , rico is back in the game , following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs  
what starship troopers really is , is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on - the soap opera like love affairs of high school , the love for sci-fi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group , etc  nothing is taken seriously  
it's almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless , but with its sly and futuristic approach , it's not as recognizably so  
it's a spoof so subtle that many won't recognize the spoofery  
if you deem this as sci-fi/action , you're wrong  
it's sci-fi/action/comedy , with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead 2  starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well  
gore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film , but the gore , too , is meant to be cheesy  
yes , it's graphic , but it's also brutally phony , and that's what makes it such great fun to watch  
not since the old "" mr  bill "" skits on "" saturday night live "" has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch  
people were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated  
perhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters' barbie dolls as young children  
with the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely , it's a good chance this is the case , whether we're fully aware of it or not  
starship troopers has it's slow parts , but it's truly an alternative to your typical sci-fi/action flick or lame juvenile comedy  
aside from the intentionally cheesy gore , the special effects are quite astounding  
when the spaceship passes a meteor , it's quite an awesome spectacle , visually crisp and captivating  
if you're looking for brainless fun , this is the epitome of your search  
a beautiful cast , awesome special effects , fast-paced action , campy acting , and a whole lot of gore  
this is brainless heaven "

1,"i was born in 1970 , which makes me barely old enough to remember bell buttons , 8 tracks and disco  
however , since i was 17 years old i've seen more than my share of adult films  
i mention this only because i thinks its important to state up front that i'm not against pornogrpahy  
i've seen enough of these films to know the range of content and quality available  
director paul thomas anderson's boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema , the mid to late 70s  
this was the period when x-rated movies were real movies , shot on film , shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics  
this was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films , films that attempted to tell a real story  
one of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how , like in an any other billion dollar industry , the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete  
in this case , the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette  
burt reynold's manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur , known as jack horner  
horner's has a steady "" family "" of performers , some of whom live in his plush l  a  home  
but in the world of porn , performers are a commodity - the fresher , the better  
when horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque , he decides to add him to his stable  
it is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his  
as directed by anderson , the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door  
boogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l  a  's hardcore film scene  
but the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends  
the downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut  
by the film's final image , what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams  
boogie nights is not about sex  
it does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers  
in fact , the film isn't really about pornography at all  
pornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own sub-culture to find acceptance of who they are  
the film goes to brilliant , often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world  
yet , like in the lauded tarantino films , these people still have their own moral code , their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively  
the characters we meet are like a road map of dysfuntion  
first stop , the den mother ( julianne moore ) in denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody of her son  
second stop , the cuckold crewman ( william h  macy ) who keeps discovering his wife having sex with anyone and everyone ( the wife is played in hilarious cameos by real-life porn star nina hartley )  
but the driving force behind the plot is 17 year old eddie adams  
eddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it  
with no real ambition of his own , he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame  
his alcoholic mother , clearly dissatisfied with her own lot , abuses him verbally and drives him out of the house  
horner introduces him to amber waves ( moore ) who immediately adopts him , a nuclear family is born  
the surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her "" babies "" provides some of the films most poignant scenes "

1,"playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task : they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare's works  
they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare : i mean , really , who doesn't think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate , introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter ? 
stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare , and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare  
and , despite the difficulty of their task , they have succeeded  
shakespeare in love is one of the smartest , funniest , most touching films of the year  
it's so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors , but here we have a movie that defines success : it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written  
it could have been a smug , self-important movie that panders to die-hard shakespeare fans , but the appeal of this film is almost universal : if you've ever read a play by shakespeare , or know anything about his life , it's likely that you'll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love  
joseph fiennes , brother of ralph , stars as shakespeare himself ; he's a delightful , irresistible lad , concerned mostly with women and detached from life's more serious problems ( debt , plague , etc  )  
he's commissioned to write plays for various people : queen elizabeth ( judi dench ) wants comedies , while local slimeball philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann ( tom wilkinson )  
shakespeare , however , has trouble focusing on his work  
he begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo and a girl named ethel  
this all changes , however , when he meets viola de lesseps ( a radiant gwyneth paltrow ) , a young heiress set to marry the financially-oriented lord wessex ( colin firth )  
shakespeare instantly falls in love with her ; he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo  
he discovers her identity and confronts her later ; she , of course , falls in love with him , although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex  
but she continues to act because she loves shakespeare's writing so much , and soon the production ( which later becomes romeo and juliet ) is set to be performed  
shakespeare in love is an amazingly good film , not because it works as great entertainment , but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter  
i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role : he has such searing optimism and energy ; he's clearly a man who admires shakespeare , and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character ( inability to turn away from women , attention deficit disorder ) , we sense a great deal of affection and care  
he practically overflows with passion in every scene  
fiennes is matched by paltrow ( whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from ) ; she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i've seen her in  
the two performers work perfectly together , taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic , and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh  
of course , it doesn't hurt that they have a masterful script to work with  
stoppard , whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film , is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor ( all of his plays have similarly dry humor )  
the first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet  
one of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play ; in the movie , shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid  
director john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor -- scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director  
i'm going to have to see the movie again ; i'm certain there are numerous references that i missed  
in fact , i doubt it's possible to gather everything with just one viewing  
stoppard is a master of detail : you'll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film , not as lines of a play , but as dialogue , suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time  
there's also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe ( and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly-homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself ) , proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe's mysterious death in a pub  
there's also a scene featuring a wide-eyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing  
 "" there's no dog in this play ? "" 
 "" no ! 
no dog ! "" 
the ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year  
geoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe ; wilkinson is also hard to recognize , but has a great role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously  
ben affleck , playing one of the actors in the company , shows great range , both in his accent ( his is almost as good as paltrow's ) and in humor ( he has some of the best one-liners in the movie )  
colin firth , always stuck playing the sap , does a good job being hateful  
judi dench , however , has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth : rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words  
my single , minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end  
the story is moving , but there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes  
but my quibbling is not important  
what is important is that i acknowledge the quality of this picture , the sheer skill with which it has been written , acted , and produced "
1,"it was with great trepidation that i approached +mary+ , the farrelly brothers+ latest film  
i knew the film would be funny--the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see  
but i also knew the film would be an equal-opportunity offender , attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon  
i figured the film would be raunchy , maybe another lucky escapee from nc-17 hell  
i may laugh , but would i feel better in the morning ? 
i needn+t have worried  
+mary+ is the sweetest , warmest , all-out laugh-and-grossfest this side of _animal house_  
surprisingly , the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side , and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers  
they make laughter , the toughest job for a filmmaker to do , look easy  
the plot is typical  
thirteen years ago , geeky ted ( ben stiller ) lucked out in having dazzling mary ( cameron diaz ) go with him to the senior prom  
as luck would have it , on that very day , he was hospitalized  
why , i shall not tell , but i assure you , it isn+t pretty  
he hires a private investigator to find her : pat healy ( matt dillon )  
he becomes one of the great comic villains  
upon finding her , he too is lovestruck , and so pursues her , lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped  
it is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double-crossed , and goes to get her for himself  
would the geek get the girl ? 
puh-lease  
the ending is pure hollywood ; no surprises there  
but the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers , hair gel , the mentally disabled , the physically handicapped , interracial marriages , homosexuals , skin conditions , serial killers , tanning , and drugged-up dogs  
the dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission , and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame  
and yet , for all the targets that are hit , the film maintains its sweet tone  
mary , playing the straight role , is as sweet and caring as she is beautiful  
she is totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother , warren ( w  
earl brown--miles away from the cameraman in _scream_ )  
mary+s sunniness carries the film here--it compliments the below-belt gags that come at you  
cameron diaz makes her totally charming , and the audience respects her , even though women in general do not usually undress before an open window  
ben stiller also fares very well , totally changing his image from his _reality bites_ and _flirting with disaster_ straight men to being a , ( how to say it ? ) , a complete loser  
braces , greasy long hair , not too bright , and very very funny  
dillon is exceptionally creepy , especially with his capped teeth  
and rounding out the cast is ted+s friend dom ( chris elliot ) , tanning addict magda ( lin shaye ) , modern troubador/greek chorus ron lichman , and mary+s sweet mom , markie post ( where has she been ? ! )  
not everything works  
chris elliot+s role , skin blemishes and all , becomes merely tasteless and boring  
there+s lousy dialogue about eight-minute vs  seven minute exercise tapes  
and there are long stretches without much going on  
but the wait is worth it  
when those extraordinary sequences hit , the entire theater erupted with howls , tears  
belly-aches , that in some sequences carried over to the following scene  
the farrelly brothers have finally done it "

1,"call me crazy , but i don't see saving private ryan as the film of the summer  
a good movie , yes , with chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion to spare  
an utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielberg's best work , no  
personally , if i was spielberg , i wouldn't go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindler's list and the indiana jones movies  
i'm guessing steve has a thing for nazis ; i really wouldn't be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swastika-wearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie  
all lofty pretenses aside , saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of a 1980s slasher flick  
the difference is , it's easy during friday the 13th to laugh off a spear sticking out of kevin bacon's chest while blood spurts like crazy , but it's damn hard to sit and eat reese's pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield  
and believe me , there's plenty of it  
a 30-minute sequence at the beginning of the movie has an army captain ( tom hanks ) and his soldiers landing at omaha beach to join countless other americans who are already under fire  
lives are lost in seconds as the purposefully confusing and jarring scene goes on and on , and all the young men in the audience find themselves never , ever wanting to be drafted  
cut to some bureaucratic defense office , where a hundred women pound out sympathy form letters to the families of the casualties  
one woman happens upon an interesting detail -- three brothers in different platoons were killed in combat , and their mother is getting the telegram today  
i guess it's an interesting conversation piece to everyone but the mother , so the army chief ( harve presnell ) sends hanks on what is essentially a public relations mission , to find the fourth ryan brother and send him home  
that way , the army saves the postage on yet another telegram to mrs  ryan  
one good thing about saving private ryan is that the soldiers who are headed to rescue ryan know it's a mission designed to make the army look good  
they question the worth of risking eight soldiers' lives to save one , and hanks' character admits he doesn't give a damn about ryan ; he's just following orders  
if this was a john wayne movie , things would be different  
there'd be a phony , "" let's go get that boy , gosh darn it ! "" 
attitude that would sugarcoat the reality of war  
by doing things this way , spielberg admits the instincts of self- preservation and complacency that every normal person has  
it makes saving private ryan a lot more powerful than an testosterone-driven stallone movie mission  
the movie's pattern is to have long battle scenes followed by quiet scenes of semi-introspective conversation among the soldiers  
hanks is painted first as a nails-tough army man careful to hide his true self from the other men  
it's not that way for long  
edward burns , the guy you get for your movie when ben affleck isn't available , is the impulsive one  
jeremy davies plays the translator who is seeing combat for the first time , and so on  
none of the characters are fascinating or natural born heroes , but was spielberg's obvious intention  
i wondered when i heard saving private ryan was three hours long , how were they going to fill three hours' time searching for one person and still make it interesting ? 
there are a few false starts ; hanks finds one private ryan in ted danson's company ( apparently , danson joined the army after "" ink "" was canceled  ) and breaks the bad news before learning it's the wrong ryan  
and of course the movie's far from over when hanks does locate ryan ( matt damon , the other guy you get when affleck isn't available )  
that's when the movie turns into more of a conventional war flick , although body parts and limbs still fly like never before  
saving private ryan is worth your time , but it's definitely no schindler's list  
the battle scenes are intense and realistic , but some of the attempts at sincere emotion aren't  
the movie's bookends are particularly cheesy and out of place , when an old private ryan goes to the cemetary with his family and bawls his eyes out , whining , "" tell me i've led a good life  
tell me i'm a good man  "" 
spielberg was apparently following the james cameron line of thought that any three-hour movie about the past should be framed by a self-contained prologue and epilogue that takes place in the present  
much more effective are subtler scenes , like the one where several of hanks' men are rifling thrugh a bag of dogtags from dead soldiers , and they make light of what they're doing by pretending they're playing poker  
this while an airborne division marches by , their eyes full of that mound of dogtags  
by not explicitly pointing out that it symbolizes the random poker game that life and death can be in war , the audience gets the message "

what can we do ?

so far america has been the leading nation , opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world  
it is the land of opportunities  
it is the land of freedom  
but what if it became the new target ? 
this dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding in reality  
when a special branch of the united states military , under the command of general william devereaux ( bruce willis ) , takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal , islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice  
the only warning the fbi receives is a single , cryptic message : "" release him  ""

devereaux argues against that eventuality , but is nevertheless ready to lead 10 , 000 men into action on american soil  
another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities  
his staff is comprised of smart , energetic , intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group o !

edward zwick has created a clever , well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season  
the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously  
and so his film plays on several levels , never loosing focus on its main objective  
he is exploring the abuse of power , the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u  s  government ( the army , the fbi , and the cia )  
he takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved  
the palestinian community in 1998 new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii  
there are concentration camps and unlawful interments , all in the name of the "" greater good  "" 
in the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul -- freedom  
was that what the terror ! 
ists really wanted ? 
this film has evoked protests and objections from the arab-american population in the u  s  and n  y "

1,"quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers  
after his pulp fiction , many actors began receiving many offers for jobs  
john travolta made his come-back and is now one of today's most bankable stars  
bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor  
jackie brown , on the other hand , boasts quite a well known cast , except for the main lead : pam grier  
most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films , but she's never really had a breakthrough performance ( her first film was in the roger ebert-written beyond the valley of the dolls )  
that is , until now  
jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino , whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction  
after mediocre acting jobs , tarantino returns to what made his name a household one : directing and writing  
jackie brown is the result , and it is fantastic entertainment  
despite excellent direction from tarantino , the cast steals the film , giving one good performance after another  
pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown , and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent--samuel l  jackson , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , and robert forster  
more than likely , you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations  
describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult , as you really can't say much or you spoil it for everyone else  
i will tread lightly  
jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport  
the camera tracks along with her , and ends up revealing her occupation  
we are also introduced to ordell robbie ( jackson ) , who sells illegal guns to interested buyers    
for a hefty price  
ms  brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away  
however , an fbi agent ( keaton ) and a local l  a  cop ( michael bowen ) are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money  
they try to reach him through beaumont livingston ( chris tucker ) , one of ordell's buyers , but he mysteriously ends up dead  
they try again through brown , but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong-doing  
but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell's friends ( fonda ) , she is caught and sent to jail  
ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent , max cherry ( forster ) , and then wants to find out what she told the cops  
after she claims to have said nothing , she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison  
ordell doesn't like this , but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track  
this scheme seems to be going as planned , but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal  
revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown , and that's the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film  
tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments ( and slang terms ) , but they are always done very well and believably  
his hitmen are normally cruel , but pleasant , in that nasty sort of way  
they talk like normal people , except for when doing business , and they are rude to their girlfriends  
of course , this is a tarantino film , and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise "
1,"the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and "" real "" movies  
consider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved -- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste  
top-flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety  
based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks , the movie represents a rethinking of the story's structure , not merely a literal adaptation of the novel  
told in linear form by four narrators in the book , egoyan's version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator  
the author is even on record as applauding egoyan's changes  
in the press notes the book's author describes the story as "" a parable of lost children  "" 
he says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children  
picking up on this , egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter , nicole burnell , played with grace by sarah polley , reads parts of "" the pied piper "" from an old , illustrated book to her two charges  
periodically throughout the picture , nicole's readings are heard in voice-over  
you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment  
they and the rest of the town's children come into harm's way -- some live and others are seriously injured  
and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again  
although the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children , the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss  
ian holm , in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career , plays mitchell stephens , an intense man of quiet misery  
mitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small , snow-encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness  
his mission there is a singular one , to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone , anyone , on their behalf  
if this seems crass , well it is , but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot  
the story unfolds slowly and always believably  
each little aspect has its own fascination  
as mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker , played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson , he has a simple task  
he wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit  
wendell ticks off one town member after another and then , as one can in a small town , enumerates each person's numerous faults  
although the town is no peyton place , people there do have their foibles  
one of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good-bye to his kids  
well , single parent billy's fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita  
his confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story  
the accident itself , a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice , isn't shown until the middle of the picture , but , nevertheless , the mystery about it builds throughout the film  
although the picture is no detective story , finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy  
as the injured bus driver , gabrielle rose , dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning  
to round out the story , mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear  
his daughter zoe ( caerthan banks ) is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half-way house and recovery center after another  
fond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help , she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk  
 ( "" i can help you , "" mitchell tries to reassure billy  
 "" not unless you can raise the dead , "" billy snaps back  
mitchell's pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder  ) 
mychael danna's haunting music sets the stage for tragedy  
the cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur , but it is in the warm , shadowy , intimate moments indoors where it works best  
the show , which is ripe for emotional manipulation , never plays with its audience "

1,"the premise of the new teen-targeted horror film `final destination' causes a recollection of a memorable `simpsons' halloween episode  
after attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster , lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable time-machine  
after a trek into the cretaceous period , homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world  
again and again , homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it  
the characters of `final destination' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence - their `design'  
someone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake  
that someone is death  
you see , alex browning ( devon sawa ) and six others have cheated the grim reaper     
but the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve  
for a high school excursion , alex's french class is traveling to paris by airline transport  
alex , tense and neurotic , has a shocking premonition after boarding : he sees the plane , and every passenger on it , spontaneously explode in mid-air  
in a panic of sheer lunacy , alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft  
after a handful of others ( including one teacher ) follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane , the unwitting ? survivors' watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky  
the loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize  
but death won't be cheated so easily , and one by one , the survivors of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances  
the grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi  
before i delve into the meat of the review , i'd just like to confer     
is that one helluva premise , or what ? 
`final destination' , creepy beyond rational comprehension , probably reads more like an unsettling `x-files' episode than `the simpsons' - therefore , the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong  
on familiar turf , the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong , and the opening 20 minutes of `final destination' reflects that  
unlike most thrillers , the set-up is crisp and cool  
you just deeply , sincerely hope that the momentum won't unspool , leaving us with a second-string effort with nothing but cheap , derivative shocks  
young viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration , what with `i know what you did last summer' and sequel , `idle hands' and -- a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil -- `urban legend'  
after the set-up , when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair , i started to really have fun with `final destination'  
low and behold , a teen thriller that is actually unsettling , actually suspenseful and -- yes -- actually intelligent  
some splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside , this film is among the most refreshing and all-out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting-edge `scream' in 1996  
`final destination' stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood-spattered slasher crap we've endured throughout the past few years  
not that the characters are that good  
sawa is game as alex , a connect-the-dots personality that we never fully comprehend  
in addition , the survivors are endearing geek tod ( chad e  donella ) , jocky control-freak carter ( kerr smith of `dawson's creek' ) , carter's ditzy girlfriend terry ( amanda detmer ) , the none-too-subtly named billy hitchcock ( seann william scott , supplier of lukewarm comic relief ) and a lone teacher - the emotionally delicate ms  lewton ( kristin cloke )  
aside from alex , the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter ( `varsity blues' ) , playing an abstract character named clear rivers ( what were her parents thinking ? ! ? )  
the personality of clear is written with such a vague , nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flash-card saying `hello , i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main character's plight ! '

1,"i hate to burst your bubble , but after all the star power , mega bucks , screenwriters , directors , and cool trailers , men in black is not the best movie of the summer  
it's pretty good in it's own right , yes , but i would probably split the "" best movie "" honors among face/off , spawn , con air , and maybe event horizon  
it's main problem is that it's quickly forgettable , and i can't remember one truly good scene from it  
from con air , it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt  
in spawn , it was the "" living room hell "" conclusion at the end  
in event horizon , it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell's forces  
and all of face/off was pretty dang good  
but as for men in black , the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches  
i remember it not for it's humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted  
and yes , i did see mimic , which is something i'll touch on in a later review  
back to men in black ( is it just me , or does that sound funny ? ) 
i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade and read magazines like wizard , etc  ( for those of you who aren't comic-geeks , wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars , what the new yorker is to high society , what boy's life is to boy scots  
okay , that one was pretty pathetic  ) 
few people know this , but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was , while not honest-politician-rare , very hard to find  
this was after the release of the high-grossing batman forever , and it said that tommy lee jones and chris o'donnell were being considered for the roles ( in the comic book , there were no black men in black  
kind of weird , huh ? ) 
all i can say is , thank god they didn't cast chris o'donnell  
i know i can't be the only person on the planet who thinks he's an annoying , preppie little snot    
sorry  
my apologies to o'donnell fans  
i actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him , anticipating rather craftily that , if the movie was a big hit , it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely  
he decided not to sell them to me , because they were "" innappropriate ""  
hmm     
so now you're probably wondering why i've wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years  
good question  
i'll move on to the movie now  
as you probably already know , will smith and tommy lee jones ( agents k and j , respectively ) belong to a top secret agency known as divison 5 , or it's nickname mib ( men in black  ) 
men in black is a reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear , and they're mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while they're here on earth  
not to get too technical or spoil the plot for the 6 people in the world who haven't seen this movie , but a basically-big-roach-type-bug lands in a redneck farmer's yard , inhabits his body , and attempts to destroy the entire universe  
not bad , eh ? ( i have no idea why i just typed that  
i'm not even really paying attention anymore  ) 
the special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black  
i found their main headquarters to be boring , as were the "" cool weapons "" they had  
the noisy cricket just plain sucked , no matter what anyone said  
and the movie definitely surprised me in tone , although it probably shoudln't have "

1,"it was easy to fear the worst  
begin with a classic 1960's television series , add a big budget and an a-list star in the lead role , and stir  
script , you ask ? 
who needs one , kid    
we've got ourselves a formula  
that was my fear : a bloated monster without any sense of direction  
then , much to my amazement , everything that could possibly go wrong    
didn't  
the fugitive is as lean , taut and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last several years  
under the direction of andrew davis ( 1992's under siege ) , the fugitive grips you by the throat from the outset and never lets go  
expect box office to go through the roof , deservedly , and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones  
the premise is a simple one  
dr  richard kimble ( harrison ford ) is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer , a man with an artificial arm  
after an escape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry , kimble finds himself on the run  
his one goal : to find the one-armed man ( andreas katsulas ) before u  s  marshall sam gerard ( tommy lee jones ) finds him  
where the fugitive surprises the most is the script , by jeb stuart and david twohy  
in a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic , the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence , its attention to detail and its respect for the audience  
in an early sequence , kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard , slick back his hair and change into a lab coat  
on his way out , a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesn't know is kimble to zip up his pants  
it's a small moment , but it punches home the urgency of kimble's situation , and exactly what a man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget  
later , while trying to lose himself in a parade , kimble thinks to drop his overcoat , the most likely way he'd be recognized from behind  
it's these details which convince us that when a colleague of kimble's tells gerard that he's too smart to be caught , he may just be right  
credit must also be given to the special effects and stunt coordinators  
the bus crash which allows kimble's escape is a spectacular sequence , as is a leap from a dam into the water below  
the action is crisp and brutal , and never romanticized  
special kudos go to director davis for maintaining a relentless pace which underscores the single-mindedness of the two leads  
and what a pair of performances those leads are  
tommy lee jones is nothing short of brilliant as gerard , because he manages an incredibly challenging feat  
for the first third of the film , there is really no * villain * per se ; kimble is on the run , and gerard is out to find him  
it would have been very easy to turn gerard into a malevolent , vindictive inspector javert , but that never happens  
instead jones plays him as a sharp , committed man who's just doing his job , so that when he responds to kimble's comment , "" i didn't kill my wife , "" with a matter-of-fact , "" i don't care , "" we know exactly what he means  
it's not his job to determine guilt or innocence  
it's his job to bring in a fugitive "

1,"it's been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller , where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters , but it's been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually * shock * cared for the characters , not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles , flaws , and strengths to emerge so radiantly  
i'd saw that it's been at least a couple decades , even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers , though i'm hardly comparing "" a simple plan "" to , say , "" rear window "" or "" strangers on a train  "" 
yet it's almost as good  
it's simple , yet strangely complex , and astonishingly rewarding , because instead of moving from plot point to plot point , and merely laying out they-might-be-caught overtones , it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to , all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral  
elegantly directed by sam raimi ( yes , the same ) , "" a simple plan "" concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright , moderately financially stable working man ( bill paxton ) , his dim-witted brother ( billy bob thornton ) , and his drinking buddy ( brent briscoe )  
without anyone around , and the possibility that no one would come looking for it , the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes , they will keep it , but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking , and so they generally don't flaunt anything they don't want to flaunt , they'll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton  
the possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners , who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves  
 "" a simple plan , "" though borrows a little from each of these  
a little tiff with the cops here , a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there ) , and a bit of inside feuding over here  
but , as austin powers would say , that's not necessarily its bag ( baby )  
what i most admired about this film , and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it's successfully able to have its cake and eat it too  
it effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches , like the ones mentioned above , but at the same time , it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag  
so while steps are taken to neatly cover things up , and these subsequent steps go miserably awry , the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to , they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity  
in one early scene , paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn't look like it was all stolen ( not a bad idea ) , when thornton screws up ( as he does continuously throughout the movie ) , and paxton has to do some major covering-up ( read : homicide )  
instead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands-washing , raimi shows a lengthy , painful shot from a low-angle onto paxton's face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion  
there's a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he's committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective , but the previous shot is even better : more morally complex and more gut-wrenching  
in short , probably the best piece of direction raimi's ever done , demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results ( for further proof , watch "" persona "" 's "" sex scene "" and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman's ever done )  
but the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof  
yet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story  
when the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife , played by bridget fonda , a pal to raimi ) , he does , and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights  
there's at least two grand shootouts , and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history , and when they arrive , they don't come with masochistic delight but with cringe-inducing horror  
during the one , i was actually sinking into my chair , with the mantra "" they can't do this , can they ? "" 
streeming through my head  
in fact , this film , which is getting many comparisons to the coen's [superior , but forget about it] "" fargo , "" has many similar moments of manic insanity , attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what , in other hands , would be over-the-top distractedness ( imagine , i suppose , robert rodriguez directing this    then 
again , after seeing the "" evil dead "" films , i'd hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off , although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed "" raimi "" moments , a rifle-shot notwithstanding )  
instead , raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch , easily letting the story and characters co-exist , while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out , like some offbeat comic touches  
most particularly , billy bob thornton's character , jacob , is a brilliant creation  
his dim-wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film , every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter ) , but there's authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we're not totally laughing at him  
the chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full-condescension because thornton is so damn real  
jacob's a multi-dimensional character , and while being stupid , we see that as not so much a flaw , but a strength to his character : his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system , primarily towards the middle where his bud and co-conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money  
the final third of the film spends much time with him , and many of the touches upon his character , not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b  smith ( adapting his own book , by the way ) are just great  
i particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend , told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near-sweetness and further strength of his saddened character  
thornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance , by far the best performance he's ever given and further proof that he's the best character actor in contemporary cinema ( if you don't believe me , go back and watch his wonderful performance in "" primary colors , "" a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn't been in the same year ) because he's easily able to slip into a character , and make him completely and utterly believable  
he brings so much weight to the film that , as it is with most character actors , it's difficult picturing anyone else in the role  
the rest of the cast is great too , from paxton's declining working man to chelcie ross' amiable town sheriff  
even fonda shows off her talents nicely  
and if i had any complaints about the film , it's that the plot is almost too simplistic , and that at times , it seems too much like an exercise , like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved "
1,"it's an interesting premise  
our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real  
in truth , our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains  
what we see , what we do , everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence  
our bodies , severely atrophied , are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet  
the sci-fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along  
the matrix isn't it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network , a sham world , the ability to plug one's brain into a computer , has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator , dark city , and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation )  
what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking  
keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo , who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer-generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines  
the group's leader , morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) , has chosen neo because he believes neo is "" the one "" who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence  
>from the beginning of the film , we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out  
this , in a lesser movie would be annoying , but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun  
what is reality ? 
what is a sham ? 
the film turns our very perception of life on its side  
more than once , we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality , or live a life of relative bliss , oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings  
as viewers , this is intriguing enough , so imagine what it would be like for neo  
and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ? 
reeves , whom i've never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety  
he was good in speed , for example , but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds  
neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely , so much of my expectation was happily for naught  
in a couple of places , the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature , and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski  
i mean , since bill and ted's excellent adventure , what movie could you say really "" utilized "" keanu reeves ? 
more interesting than reeves is fishburne , who's morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions , and convincingly so  
very surprising for a sci-fi movie  
fishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout , as if he always knows what to expect  
this helps to further the aura of his character's proficiency and extensive knowledge  
hugo weaving as agent smith , one of the artificial intelligence's anti-intruder programs , is also good playing his deadpan , no-nonsense , kick ass role , which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time  
unfortunately , when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row , the nature of his character's speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive  
carrie-anne moss plays trinity , morpheus's number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo  
although her character is somewhat inconsistent , moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn't in the picture  
there were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects  
many methods of imagery are employed , from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics  
of special note is the use of the "" freeze and turn "" effect where the entire scene is frozen , turned , then continued from a new angle  
this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi-circle , with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends  
the motion cameras film the action , and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once  
place each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second  
pretty slick  
the matrix drips with style  
from the clothing to the music to the action , we're watching an exaggerated version of what we're used to  
much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there's a lot of kung fu , there's a lot of gunplay  
when a character is letting go with an automatic weapon , much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion  
there's also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados ) , especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects "

the birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy  
then along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released  
it's also noticeable that this "" alternative lifestyle "" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort  
while it's a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety  
but the way we're using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically  
while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy  
it doesn't poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it's comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been  
the idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids-afflicted gay man in philadelphia  
if you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life  
it's a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick  
it's true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set  
kevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana  
after a three-year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar  
the small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other  
when cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr  brackett  
everyone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , "" and he's gay  "" 
the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop  
the thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf  
naturally the questions pour from howard's fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school's principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand  
the frenzy isn't helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and "" entertainment tonight "" wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning  
one particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of "" inside entertainment "" , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding  
the intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute  
it seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees  
the dominoes begin to tumble as howard's closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay  
it all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it weren't presented with near-perfection by one of this year's most delightful ensemble casts  
kline seems only to improve with age , and he is downright perfect here  
the great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine , and they use it wonderfully  
every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever  
dillon has never been so likeable , cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role , and brimley , reynolds , and newhart all provide huge laughs when they're up to bat  
rudnick's script is heavily laced with wit and humor , and you'll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes  
while in & out doesn't carry enough to give it four stars , it remains one of the best done films of the year , all-around  
the script is exuberant , the actors are absolutely top- notch , and we're allowed just the perfect blend of heart-tugging so as not to bog down the laughs  
it remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety , yet we're still allowed a sappily touching ending  
despite it's subject matter , and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex , this is a movie that everyone could , and should , enjoy  
frank oz , best known as a voice talent for muppets , directs this film quite delightfully , using all the potential rudnick's script has to offer , which turns out to be quite a bit  
check this one out  
you'll have a gay old time "

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
 "" all the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts "" - excerpt from as you like it , act ii , scene 7 
when william shakespeare penned this passage , he could not have possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent , or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash  
this is the world of today , and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical high-concept project like the truman show  
truman burbank ( jim carrey ) seems to have the perfect life  
he has a pretty , doting wife meryl ( laura linney ) , a comfortable insurance sales position , an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven , a reliable childhood buddy marlon ( noah emmerich ) -- except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia , this is paradise  
or so it would seem  
bizarre , inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in truman's life  
a lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky  
a rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term 'isolated' follows him around  
a radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move  
for the first time in his life , it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be  
the truman show , directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol , is a remarkably well-constructed film , paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next  
balancing drama with humour , thoughtfulness with abandon , this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy  
in many ways , mr  niccol's screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca -- both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity , with pivotal , character-defining moments occurring at sea  
although the film's rather conventional climax doesn't sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two-thirds , and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch , there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception  
despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film , it remains foremost a finely-crafted piece of entertainment , constantly light and accessible  
the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude , and as the carefully-stacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down , the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false  
the end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable , crowdpleasing underdog vs  
the system formula  
while the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept , some elements are lacking  
the device of mysterious lauren/sylvia ( natascha mcelhone ) as a contributing impetus to truman's growing awareness isn't exactly convincing  
there's not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves , and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ( ed harris ) with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience , thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film  
in fact , although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside truman's artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers , it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even * more * deeply in the insulatory seahaven world , with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling  
still , the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target , and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti-voyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city  
i've always believed that the versatile ms  linney possesses a tremendous comic gift -- she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes -- and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character , mischievously flashing a glazed , insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans  
cheerfully going over the top , it's hilarious to watch her -- who would have ever guessed that she'd have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film ? 
ms  linney is a delight in the film  
but it is mr  carrey who rules the show here  
he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank -- the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts -- but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal : it's difficult not to root for truman  
in a commanding performance , mr  carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence , and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn , demonstrating admirable restraint -- there's an early scene where he's down on his knees gardening , and given his past track record , one almost instinctively anticipates mr  carrey to pull one of more infamous , and in this case , wholly inappropriate sight gags  
it's almost poetic how this notorious look-at-me actor successfully tones it down to play a character who's constantly the centre of attention  
in addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast -- mr  emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness -- the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman's antiseptic , white picket-fenced smalltown utopia , and by burkhard dallwitz's original score "
1,"star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) 
review by matt pusateri 
few movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas' 1977 classic , star wars  
the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture  
arguably , more americans today can explain what "" the force "" or a "" jedi "" is than a budget deficit or a serb  
so 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? 
can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? 
against this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week  
and despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment  
while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking  
it is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films  
the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films  
as the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson )  
the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation  
the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo's young queen amidala ( natalie portman )  
later , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice  
on tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts  
qui-gon senses the child is "" unusually strong "" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be "" the one "" prophesized to "" bring balance to the force  "" 
as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader  
complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala  
while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul  
if the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is  
the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin's turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy  
but the complexity is not overwhelming  
the story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode  
one of the reasons the film's story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused  
it's unclear whose story phantom menace is  
in the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke's story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight  
but it's unclear whether this new film is anakin's story or obi-wan's  
if this trilogy is centered on anakin , it's a shaky foundation  
lloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive  
on screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is "" the one  "" 
the rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas  
neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight  
mcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility  
portman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality  
the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them  
individually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series  
but unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn't do as good of a job playing the characters off one another  
in star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke  
the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities  
in the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other  
there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other "

1,"true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head-on , which is probably why so few of them do it  
even the most religious directors - like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman - usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms  
so it's not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get "" the apostle "" onto the big-screen  
as a matter of fact , even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing , and he ended up paying for it with $5 million of his own money  
he also wrote the script , directed the film , and starred as the central character , a fiery texas preacher named euliss "" sonny "" dewey  
few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial , technical , and creative responsibility single-handedly , and it's testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall  
and , thankfully , every bit of that personal investment translates on-screen into power and honest emotion  
sonny is an energetic , pentecostal preacher who has been speaking ( actually shouting ) from behind the pulpit since he was twelve  
he spends much of his time traveling about the country , evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals  
unlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers , sonny is not a phony or a swindler , and the film's purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church  
duvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says , although like all humans , he has weaknesses  
one of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that , not only does his long-suffering wife , jessie ( farrah fawcett ) , want to leave him for another man in the congregation , but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher  
faced with the loss of two things he loves passionately- his church and his family - that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper  
at his son's baseball game , sonny snaps and smashes his wife's lover in the face with a baseball bat , inflicting a wound that may be fatal  
not knowing what else to do , sonny disappears  
he throws away his identification , drives his car into a lake , and takes a bus to louisiana , hoping to start over again  
in the tiny , mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte , sonny once again finds his calling  
after befriending a simple auto mechanic ( walt goggins ) and tracking down the town's ex-minister ( john beasley ) , sonny sets up his own church , the one way to heaven temple  
re-christening himself as "" the apostle e  f  , "" he quickly draws together an eager congregation , and together they realize real change in each other's lives  
but , always , sonny's past is lurking a step behind him , waiting to swallow his progress  
duvall has made his intentions in making "" the apostle "" clear  
in a recent article in "" newsweek , "" he wrote : "" filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit , and when they do , it tends to be patronizing - full of charlatans and snake handlers    
but what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe , and to portray it in an accurate way  "" 
the strength of duvall's convictions turn out to be the strength of his film - "" the apostle "" always rings true , even in the most painful moments , because we know he's being sincere with the subject matter  
after fifteen years of traveling the country , listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said , duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual  
his sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to  
 "" i've always called you jesus and you've always called me sonny , "" he says  
when neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs , sonny's mother ( june carter cash ) just hangs up on them because she knows there's no sense trying to interrupt him  
the main theme to emerge from "" the apostle "" is the fact that good can come from any situation  
sonny's act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing , and duvall never shrinks from that fact  
however , that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte , where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him  
in his short time in louisiana , he does a world of good , and when the police finally show up to take him away , he goes quietly , knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him  
and , as a scene during the final credits shows , he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment  
it is that strength in sonny's character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others - he is flawed , but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws  
weak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves "

1,"natural born killers is really a very simple story that , in essence , has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis , mood and degree  
both films glamorize "" outlaws , "" in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers  
both relate the story of a couple liberated by love  
but where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle , natural born killers is total and blatant  
where bonnie & clyde was social , natural born killers is psychological  
what bonnie & clyde hinted at , natural born killers confronts and explores  
what bonnie and clyde stole , mickey and mallory kill  
to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them , expressed metaphorically as killing , subdues the mysterious power this film wields  
for the most part , when mickey and mallory kill , they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily , they kill what is trying to kill them , they kill what dissembles and cowers from life , they kill what needs to be killed  
this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity  
brahma created  
vishnu preserved  
and siva destroyed , but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma  
the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate , i'm forced to say it for clarity's sake : a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes , that is , destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics  
your plumber , bonnie and clyde , mickey and mallory , and siva are all productive destroyers  
i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death , presently and historically , than any other phenomena  
muslims kill christians  
hindus kill muslims  
christians kill pagans  
jews kill christians , etc  you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged  
religion is an orgy of killing  
the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn't been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable  
 "" the state is the divine idea upon earth , "" hegel said , meaning it is absolute , all-powerful , ineffable , unassailable , infallible , authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh , allah , god , etc  
well , what does all this have to do with natural born killers ? 
let me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex  
consider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever  
god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc  they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other  
during the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power  
 ( parenthetically , witness plato as well  
in the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime  
not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions  ) 
catholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil  
it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure  
masturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution  
this is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence  
as further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters  
our culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years  
we can't help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self "

1,"it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship , a green ovular pin , and the birth of oscar wilde , but if one really strains , they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off  
wilde's philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature , and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned , loosing his family and his career  
the glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise  
the main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life ( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality ) , they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else  
and that's why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began  
it's been said that todd haynes' "" velvet goldmine , "" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement , not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it , steals a lot from "" citizen kane , "" and that's true  
in the film , a british journalist in the 80s , arthur stuart ( christian bale ) , is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade , a fictitious rock star , who faked his own death on stage , bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement  
structure-wise , this totally steals from "" kane , "" not only from the set-up ( he interviews three people , and the story is a result of their flashbacks ) , but in other things , like the beginning ( death , then newsreel ) , and smaller details , like the bitter ex-friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex-wife as a washed-up lounge singer , found in a bar after hours  
this is no "" kane , "" and it really doesn't aspire to be : it doesn't attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like "" kane "" did , and it doesn't really uncover anything poignant about humanity  
instead , it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants  
the 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy , equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging  
but the 70s scenes are engaging , though , not to mention addictively campy  
they radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era , and a feel that's so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then-footage , they become not only a symbol of decadence , but of times when everything seemed so simple  
instead of creating the world the way it was , haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale : the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you've experienced it , everything else seems so mundane  
there's no outside world to speak of , secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack  
haynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero , curt wild , and their relationship that created , molded , and then brought down the movement , reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that - contributors  
blade - played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers - and wild - played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor - are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop , respectively , complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one-time partners in music , but also partners in bed  
through discussions with slade's ex-manager cecil ( michael feast ) , ex-wife mandy ( toni collette , reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade ) , and finally ex-partner wild , journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era , like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity , including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality ( when he opens up his first slade record , he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket ) , and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene , finally resulting in leading a boring job in america  
haynes demonstrates that he's quite the visual auteur , molding scenes that are like long heald breaths , such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade/wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover , "" baby's on fire , "" with scenes from a decadent drug party ; and the film's most wow-inspiring sequence , the first concert scene of wild with his band , the ratttz , where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy-esuqe movements ( including stripping naked ) and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent , and another ( slade ) discovers his idle  
even the brief music videos , spoofs of bowie's , have a rare visual flair that's pure camp , and which would cause ken russell to drool  
the best sequence , though , may be the beginning , following the prelude , a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the post-movement era  
in it , stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death , where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination , which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet  
with brian eno's famous "" needle in the camel's eye "" playing in the background , the scene has a detached exhileration - the song doesn't seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are  
it has a distance that's hard to put a finger on , and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending , and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show , docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair , depressingly staring into the mirror , it comes off as a none-too-obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film  
this movie's not so much about plot , but more about the way it is presented , making this one of those films which is classified as being "" style over substance , "" a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack  
however , for the most part , the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world , by using his sets , costumes , cinematography , and especially the music to play as characters in his film  
the music is especially notable  
the soundtrack , which is wall to wall , consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno , t-rex , and roxy music , as well as covers by slade's band ( with vocals by thom yorke , and occasionally rhys meyers himself ) , and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie-like  
the cast is rather impressive , but no one really walks away with the film , and no performances are extremely good  
although eddie izzard , as slade's manager ( who challenges slade's first manager to an arm-wrestling match to see who gets control of his career ) and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly , and collette and mcgregor have their moments , rhys meyers and bale are noticably sub-par , neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles  
some of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes  
rhys meyers' brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era , dying when he turned into a retro-garbo , resorting to a life of salinger-ism , and found in the mid-70s to be lying around , sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl  
in fact , no one in this film is really seen as a person , rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era  
bale's character is an especially tough sell : bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood , he's not an extremely personal character , and his cliched experiences ( being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a "" poof "" ) never help us communicate with him  
nevertheless , rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them , and others , bitter , part of which helps the film work , since this is a major piece of eye candy  
at the prime of the movie , they at least look the role of fashionable leaders - slade with his perpetually-changing , androgonys persona , and wild with his topless and unpredictable image , which clash and fuse into an unstable union  
their story - of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who-cares attitude crossed with camp - is engaging , without the personal background  
the story of stuart , though , is a tougher sell because he's the everyman , and when you can't totally identify with the everyman , your story's in slight trouble  
as a cultural rock piece , "" velvet goldmine "" is rather good , but it is merely good "
1,"hilarious , ultra-low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers ( brian o'halloran and jeff anderson )  
they spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to self-fulfillment  
the premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all get-out , but you could spend ten times the film's budget ( a reported $27 , 000 ) and still not get dialogue half as good as this  
originally rated nc-17 for language  
not recommended for viewers with sensitive ears  
killing zoe =========== 
remake reservoir dogs as a french art film and you're halfway to killing zoe , writer/director roger avary's slow-moving story of a failed bastille day bank robbery  
eric stoltz stars as an american in paris who gets in * way * over his head when hooks up with a band of nihilistic bank robbers  
he's the safecracker who's blissful unaware that the bank job is a botch job from the word go  
though intriguing on all fronts , the film is paced at half the speed of pulp fiction , which avary co-wrote with quentin tarantino  
in english and french  
the road to wellville ===================== 
based on the novel by t  coraghessan boyle , the road to wellville doesn't go very far  
bowels , bowels , and more bowels are explored by dr  john harvey kellogg ( a buck-toothed and bespectacled anthony hopkins ) , who , in the early 1900's , advocated abstinence , vegetarianism , and frequent defecation  
he also invented the cornflake  
really  
checking-in to kellogg's battle creek sanitarium are matthew broderick and bridget fonda , just two of the many well-known faces in this failed comedy  
leave your laughter at the door and you can marvel at the unfunny antics of john cusack , michael lerner , lara flynn boyle , john neville , and dana carvey  
the art direction is impeccable and some of the early sequences are amusing , but the novelty quickly wears off as writer/director alan parkers tries his darnedness to turn doo-doo into drama  
what he ends up with is something that i can't print here  
phew ! 
stargate ======== 
lawrence of arabia meets star wars  
this epic sci-fi film is more sheer spectacle than anything else  
director roland emmerich ( universal solider ) shamelessly rips off lucas and spielberg and just about any other cosmic cliche that he can lay his hands on  
the film is overlong , the characters are cardboard , and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in modern sci-fi history  
that said , there's still plenty to watch here  
sci-fi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands , the morphing headdresses , and a surprisingly spunky james spader  
he plays the egyptologist who gets to prove his theory that that "" somebody else "" built the pyramids  
less interesting are co-stars kurt russell and jaye davidson of crying game fame  
star trek generations ===================== 
trek fans may be more forgiving , but , for the rest of us , the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best  
the story is interesting , but each scene goes too long  
the cast is earnest , but the direction lacks punch  
and so on  
 ( the best example of the latter is a klingon comeuppance that delivers none of the impact of a similar scene in star trek ii  ) 
original enterprise captain james t  kirk appears on both ends of the story , though they cut the scene where shatner turns to the screen to plead "" get a life  "" 
remarkably unremarkable  
miracle on 34th street ====================== 
in a season of the specialist and pulp fiction et al , maybe a remake of miracle on 34th street * is * necessary  
john hughes certainly believes in santa claus and his les mayfield-directed production does nothing to tarnish the memory of the 1947 original  
the romance between costars dylan mcdermott and elizabeth perkins doesn't work too well , but the film makes a strong case that richard attenborough is the definitive kriss kringle "

1,"you've got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk  
the title is generic  
it's meaningless  
and i can't believe it's good business  
when you pick up the phone and dial 777-film , how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jean-claude van damme movie , the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot , is called , geez , maximum risk ? 
yuck  
the movie itself deserves your attention  
for sweet bloody thrills , this one beats the summer blockbuster competition hands-down  
only mission : impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller , and i'll give maximum risk the edge simply because it's not as slick as the tom cruise picture , and therefore more gratifying in its execution  
much to my surprise , van damme continues to develop as a pleasant , unpretentious action hero  
his track record isn't as solid as schwarzenegger's , but he's a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold  
in 1993 , van damme worked with hong kong's premier hardcore action director , john woo , on a fairly lame movie called hard target  
 ( if you can find a bootleg copy , woo's radically different director's cut is much better than what was eventually released  ) 
this follow-up is directed by ringo lam ( city on fire , full contact ) , whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo's more operatic offerings  
the surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo's subsequent broken arrow  
here's the rundown  
van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend ( jean-hugues anglade ) finds a corpse that's alain's exact double  
turns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother , michael , who has been killed by some russian heavies ( and some strangely american looking cops )  
alain does some investigating  
he finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city , and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia  
assuming michael's identity , alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michael's girlfriend ( natasha henstridge ) , the fbi , and the russian mob in little odessa  
that's as much as you need to know  
the story is adequate , but not overly involving -- and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice , just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment  
there's a love story , too , but i didn't find it terribly convincing , partly because ex-model henstridge is too high-strung in her high-profile debut ( she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species )  
she's great to look at , and she can certainly read a line , but what she does here can't really be described as "" acting  "" 
of course , "" acting "" isn't really what she was hired for ( i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme's )  
the movie is exceptionally violent , bordering on gratuity  
 ( keep that in mind when planning your date  ) 
the stunts are spectacular , and the fact that you can spot van damme's stand-in makes his work no less impressive  
there's only so much you can do with a car wreck , but this movie makes crisp , effective use of pile-ups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies  
and lam has a surprising , innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action  
the main difference between lam and woo , i believe , is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces , lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and double-barreled points of view to make things run  
don't get me wrong -- when chow yun-fat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woo's hard-boiled , it's an amazing moment  
but it's a moment that's hard to reproduce in hollywood  
 ( for one thing , hollywood doesn't yet have chow yun-fat ! ) 
while woo's hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart , maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture  
the very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city , but lam's use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on  
the film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lam's shooting style , accentuating rather than amplifying the action  
the performances could have used some fine tuning ( in particular , there's an annoying , overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely ) , and the movie doesn't always overcome the limitations of its genre  
the story is a little mundane , although there are some effective moments involving van damme's unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had  
but it's not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture , and it's doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity "

1,"this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueff's play "" hospitality suite  ''its 
about three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention , whose chicago company has sent them to wichita , where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent a hospitality suite on the 16th floor of the hotel , where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna , someone named dick fuller , who is the head of a big industrial corporation  
he is someone they have never met before , but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account , it is their only reason for coming to the convention  
 "" the big kahuna "" revels in salesmen-talk among the three white christian males , two of them , larry ( spacey ) and phil ( devito ) , who are veteran salesmen , having teamed together for the last twelve years , while bob ( facinelli ) is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department  
these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna , as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite  
the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job , and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life  
the outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why  
what comes into question is their opinions on life and death , on god and morality , and on how they make a living  
these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch  
their dialogue is acerbic , witty , and analytical  
following in the long tradition of salesmen films -- from death of a salesman , the tin men , and glengarry glen ross , as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high  
in this case , it is landing the big kahuna  
they each are trying to see why he's on top and why they are chasing after him  
what makes this film different than the others , is its blatant religious message , comparing orthodox religion to what they do , as both must sell their product  
and how after each one's psyche is stripped clean by the other , there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each  
the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna , but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen  
larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life  
bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ  
his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in  
bob is a baptist , who takes a very non-questioning and literal attitude about religion  
to just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin , according to the way he reads the bible  
when asked by larry why he married his wife , he seems puzzled and can't even say because he loves her , only that marriage is something sacred to him  
the contrast in their personalities is stark  
larry is all business , he simply wants to close the sale  
he comes into the room pumped for the convention , using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman  
he criticizes phil for being so placid , for getting such a small suite , for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp , and for being burned-out  
he tells him to go on a vacation  
get a woman  
while phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change , now that he is 52 and is painfully divorcing his wife , after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long  
he now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in  
he has always been a charmer , shaking everyone's hand , trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale  
larry is more aggressive as a salesman , he is always a heart attack away from every big sale  
in contrast , bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him  
this is his first time for him on the road  
when dick fuller doesn't arrive at the party the salesmen throw , larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering  
when told that he spoke to the secretary , larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account  
but when they start talking to bob , whom they forced to act as the bartender , they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another man's name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus  
bob then tells the boys about a private party fuller is attending afterwards , and that he invited bob to attend  
larry and phil can't fathom how bob didn't make a sales pitch "

1,"there is a scene early in soul food , george tillman's comedy-drama about a large african-american family and the ordeals they go through during a crisis , that caught me completely off guard  
during a wedding , the groom is flirting with some tramp , and in an attempt to to prevent a scene , his mother in law , played by irma p  hall , comes to the rescue  
the way in which she does this makes me think irma p  hall is one of the greatest actresses around right now  
however , this is just one magical moment in a movie filled with them  
vanessa williams , vivica fox , and nia long star as three sisters who have each gone their own way in life  
williams is teri , a successful lawyer , who is frustrated by her husband miles attempts at a music career  
fox is maxine , the strongest of the sisters , which can be confirmed by the stability of her marriage and the wisdom of her son ahmad , who narrates the film  
long is bird , a hairdresser who is the last of the three to get married  
her husband lem is an intense passionate individual whose temper gets the best of him sometime but never stops loving  
at the center of everything is irma p  hall , as big mama jo  
every sunday , the family gathers together for dinner at mama jo's house  
there is lots of conversation , lots of laughs , and the occasional controversy  
mama jo presides over the family like all mothers should  
she is stern and disciplined , but also caring and forgiving  
everything is going fine , until a tragedy befalls mama jo  
all of a sudden , a chain reaction of events begin to destroy the family  
it gets so bad , sunday dinner is even cancelled  
without mama jo's guidance , there is noone to keep the family together , which frustrates ahmad  
miles and maxine's marriage begins to fall apart , as he focuses on his music and flirts with the troublesome faith  
lem's temper gets the best of him when his convict past starts to catch up to him  
and teri tries to prevent maxine's efforts to sell mama jo's house  
the third act of the film deals with ahmad's attempts to patch things up  
he decides to take over where mama jo left off , and tries to get the family back together for one more sunday dinner  
the acting by everyone in the ensemble is outstanding , with special notices to irma p  hall and brandon hammond  
hall gives a performance that deserves to be recognized by the academy  
her mama jo is one of the most memorable characters i have ever encountered in a movie  
brandon hammond is an actor with a bright future  
he is wise enough not to play cutesy and shows an admirable range and depth , and speaks the final lines of the movie on the perfect note  
tillman obviously based this movie on his own memories of growing up  
every scene in the movie is purposeful and convincing ( except maybe an odd flashback sequence )  
the dialogue is beleiveable and funny  
and then there's the food  
tillman gives us several close ups of the soul food , and it indeed looks very tasty  
i can see why sunday dinners became such a tradition for this family  
soul food is one of the most purely entertaining movies of the year "

1,"bruce willis and sixth sense director m  night shyamalan re-team to tell the story of david dunne ( willis ) , a stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child  
on a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job , dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of  
to make things even stranger , dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed  
a comic book art dealer named elijah price ( samuel l  jackson ) , who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly , has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life  
price felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him    
someone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break  
price contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child  
dunne doesn't believe him at first , but price assists him in discovering his "" powers "" and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is  
writer/director m  night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense  
how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years ? 
for shyamalan , the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners  
does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash , though ? 
the answer to that question is not a very easy one , either  
as far as pacing goes , the sixth sense seemed almost interminable  
it wasn't until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re-connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached  
for unbreakable , shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which , in many ways , blows away the film that had come before  
the story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan's direction is excellent , with the camera almost constantly moving  
there are tons of great shots in the film , not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis' character and another train passenger  
the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak  
also very impressive is the film's score by james newton howard ( who also scored shyamalan's sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes , as well as this year's dinosaur )  
several of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film  
one of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to "" exercise "" his powers  
the music , in combination with the stellar visuals , really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie  
if there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year , this one would be it  
the film also boasts some great performances , including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment  
willis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne , who just can't seem to figure out why he's been depressed for the last few years  
his character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him , but he eventually grows into his own under elijah's tutelage  
jackson is one of the better actors of our time , and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah  
though his hairstyle is absurd , jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked  
robin wright penn's role seems slightly underwritten , but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character's need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again  
spencer treat clark , as the dunne's young son jeremy , shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors , and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film  
out of all the characters , jeremy's is perhaps the most emotional , and clark does a great job with the role  
where the film does lose points though , is during its "" surprise "" ending  
shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense , but i found myself saying "" that was it ? ! "" 
when unbreakable revealed its own ending  
it's not that the ending is bad , it's just that the ending doesn't quite have the emotional punch that the other film's did  
plus , it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels ( and i won't reveal the ending here , but you'll understand what i mean when you see it ) "

1,"earth is a harsh , unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent  
people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict , as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee  
the story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves  
the action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but it is really about her nanny , shanta  
shanta has a small circle of male admirers  
two of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim  
the others--sikh , hindu , muslim--are older ; some are married ; but all appreciate shanta , who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das  
 ( she also starred in deepa mehta's previous film , fire , the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water  ) 
in an early scene , the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny ; political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears  
one of the men remarks , jokingly , that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along  
he is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism  
the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses  
it is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter  
the group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together  
but the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state  
a sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees  
another man is murdered  
the group of friends will not meet again  
the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child , and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles  
it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully  
the crux of earth's plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz  
his sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , because they are muslim  
dil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that she marry him  
but she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz's offer  
the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him , and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality : the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate  
despite the things he later does , it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things  
the conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz's transformation--is rather abrupt  
the story earth tells does not end  
it just stops  
it is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction  
but there was no resolution for india and pakistan--they have been at war , on a small or large scale , for decades  
since the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation , it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus  
there is no healing to be had , no closure , on any level ( despite the needless , tacked-on ending , with voice-over narration from lenny as an adult , framing the story )  
earth is , in some ways , an unexceptional movie  
it does not reinvent the wheel , following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas  
but deepa mehta's directon is assured , and the issues she addresses run deep  
earth does for india what movies like zhang yimou's to live and tian zhuangzhuang's the blue kite did for china : they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history  
such films strike me as inherently valuable , even when flawed  
they may be biased or inaccurate , but they bear the weight of human hardship , and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other , more inventive films , often lack "

1,"synopsis : captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of 600 , the ba'ku , from the evil admiral dougherty and ru'afro  
the enterprise crew , in the meantime , experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba'ku homeworld : lt  worf grows a pimple , data sings opera pieces , picard scores with a ba'ku chick , riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi , and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts  
comments : "" star trek : the next generation "" was a hugely successful sequel tv series to "" star trek , "" a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s  
even though it still enjoyed high ratings , "" star trek : the next generation "" ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original "" star trek "" 's cast in paramount's film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise  
star trek : insurrection is the ninth "" star trek "" movie and the third to focus on the "" star trek : the next generation "" crew  
star trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans , such as myself , would rate somewhere between "" okay "" and "" good  "" 
after star trek v : the final frontier , a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant "" star trek : voyager "" tv series , "" star trek "" fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise  
i don't wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies  
most people reading this probably haven't followed "" star trek "" anyway , so a comparison would seem tedious at best  
let me , thus , make my comparisons briefly so that it's out of my system : star trek : insurrection is not as good as the previous installment , star trek : first contact ; star trek : insurrection's comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv : the voyage home ; star trek ii : the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie  
okay  let's move to the movie itself  
star trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise , humanity's exploration and colonization of space , with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners  
this combination works well more often than it fails , but when it does fail , the humor really seems cheesy  
much of this film appeals to trek fans' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise's crew  
audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times  
star trek : insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba'ku homeworld  
forget the actors and special effects , the beautiful setting of this movie , with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys , steals the show  
this tranquility , however , is broken by data , an android , who reveals to the ba'ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies , the son'a  
it seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth , sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young , healthy state  
the enterprise crew , led by captain picard , investigates data's actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the son'a and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba'ku and plunder the planet's youth-restoring properties  
sound pretty heavy ? 
it is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film's constant barrage of humor  
when going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous )  
in a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba'ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , cannot avoid looking at  
the acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good  
since they've been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough  
the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean-luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard's trademark , with his usual aplomb  
brent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android-wishing-to-be-human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series )  
the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good  
despite many other critics' negative opinions , f  murray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru'afro well enough  
ru'afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune  
like the baron , ru'afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants  
in one particularly memorable scene , ru'afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds  
ru'afro is no khan from star trek ii--the best trek villain ever--but he is much better than the forgettable dr  soran from star trek : generations

1,"america has finally gotten what it's needed for years : a compassionate sincere president with impressive ethics and charisma  
regretfully it's only a movie  
president james marshall ( harrison ford ) is fed up with terrorist activities  
teaming up with the russian government , he orders a strike force capture of alexander radek , a reactionary general ready to re-unite the soviet union under his fascist reign  
during a celebration dinner , marshall announces to the world that he will send troops to fight oppression wherever it exists  
 "" it's your turn to be afraid , "" he declares  
returning home on air force one , he gets the chance to demonstrate his words personally  
ultra-nationalist militants loyal to radek and lead by ivan korshunov ( gary oldman ) hijack the plane threatening to kill a hostage every half hour until the general is released  
marshall has a chance to escape in a jettisoned capsule ( which clinton says doesn't exist in real life ) but refuses , preferring to stay and fight  
director wolfgang peterson ( "" das boot "" , "" in the line of fire "" , "" outbreak "" takes the over-used "" die hard "" theme and gives us something new in a film that combines brilliant acting with hold-your-breath intensity  
if you can take your eyes off the screen , steal a look at the audience  
everyone is totally engrossed  
the two actors do what they do best and they are probably the best there are at it  
oldman has become typecast as a psychotic sadist and no wonder -- he does it so well  
when he engages the teenage first daughter in sensitive conversation about his family and the next minute threatens to blow a hole in her forehead , you know that he's over the edge in the manner that people with a cause can become  
you are convinced that young alice could end up terminated at any time  
when korshonov executes passengers , there is a frightening reality to it  
the guns in this film are deadly weapons , not cartoons  
harrison ford has done one role for several years  
his mastery of the man in the suit propelled into desperate action is in top form here  
marshall is a medal of honor recipient who now has a desk job  
realistically , he's a man afraid , but not afraid to act  
ford is one of the few actors that could make us believe that the president of the united states could be an action hero  
indiana jones in the oval office  
he and oldman's archetypes match up perfectly  
the other roles also go to accomplished actors  
glenn close as the determined but unsure vice-president is the picture of an executive forced into a position that she's not quite ready for  
dean stockwell as defense secretary eager for the authority ( "" i'm in charge here ! "" ) 
is her political nemesis and turns in a good alexander haig performance  
of course the politics are all wrong  
a cowboy president ( even down to his name ) with big guns shoots his way through problems  
much like the american collective memory of jfk's camelot , the image is wondrous if you don't look too deep  
the pulls on the patriotic heartstrings would be too much in any other film , but they work here  
no matter what political spin you put on the story , the movie is an outstanding one  
i left the theater feeling that there is hope for the country's future : not a common belief nowadays  
now if we only can get ford to run for president  
just because one actor didn't work out as chief executive doesn't mean that a different one couldn't

1,"when i first heard that disney's next animated feature was going to be tarzan , i was almost horrified  
i was worried that disney was going to make another hercules ( sorry , jerk-ules )  
that effort was too overloaded with comedy ( and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero ) , and , after viewing it to this day , i find it a disgrace for disney animation  
when i saw the trailers , i was thinking "" hmm    
this isn't bad at all  
this just might have potential  "" 
when i bought the soundtrack , i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features  
i have never really heard of phil collins , nor have i heard of mark mancina , so i was wondering , how would these two make this disney flick spin ? 
i was pleasantly surprised : the music is top-notch  
phil collins' songs are terrific , percussion-heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs  
the score from mark mancina was also neat ; it reminded me a bit of the lion king , but it was more original  
so , the soundtrack wasn't bad at all , considering it was by two people i am not familiar with  
this film could be good    
but will it be ? 
when i finally went to see it ( on opening day , as i tend to do with most disney animated features ) , my question was answered , in a complete turnabout of expectations for me : disney's tarzan is surprisingly decent  
the story starts out with tarzan's parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace  
however , one day , a vicious leopard , sabor , attacks and kills tarzan's parents , leaving him ( at this time , a baby ) alone-until kala of the apes rescues him  
kala wants to raise the child as her own ( she lost hers previously to sabor ) , but her mate , kerchak is not too sure  
 "" it's not our kind , "" he says  
he agrees , though , to let her take care of little tarzan , but "" that doesn't make him my son  "" 
tarzan grows up , vowing to be "" the best ape ever "" , but no matter how hard he tries or what he does ( at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend , terk ) , he just can't convince kerchak that he is one of the apes , even when he defeats sabor in a battle  
one day , a new animal shows up : humans  
this is where jane comes into the picture  
she is on an expedition with her father ( professor porter ) , and a despicable hunter ( clayton ) searching for gorillas  
tarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons , and soon they get to know each other  
even though tarzan falls in love with jane , this causes things to go wrong  
clayton tricks tarzan into taking him , jane , and porter to see the apes , who are convinced that he has betrayed them  
worse , clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money  
will tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes ? 
i'm not gonna tell you , sorry  
you're gonna have to see for yourself  
and see it you should ; the animation is , as always , top notch , particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees ( read that , skateboarding )  
the deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in  
in fact , it seems similar to the computer imagery/cel animation combination in rival disney animted films , such as fox's anastasia and dreamworks' prince of egypt  
could it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals ? 
the casting is fairly good  
tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan ( and to my relief , the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules  
nicely done ) , and glenn close is wonderful as kala ( she has a beautiful singing voice , too , by the way )  
lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson's beast voice , which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping "
1,"on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements ( in case you missed it , warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail  
he says to a black congregation ""    if you can't cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife , you're never gonna get rid of me  "" ) 
well , there is such a plot , and it works very well in this comedy  
beatty plays jay billington bulworth , a long-time democratic senator from california  
the movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth's latest commercials condemning affirmative action  
the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy  
when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv , having gone without food or sleep for days  
his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care  
first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe - a $10 million life insurance policy in his daughter's name  
then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination  
his assistant murphy ( oliver platt ) is oblivious to bulworth's suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements  
bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african-american church , then takes questions from the audience  
he is hit hard with questions about his voting record  
he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots , and it hasn't shown up  
since he's a dead man anyway , he figures he'll answer truthfully : he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l  a  for the photo opportunity  
they made some promises that improved their public image for a while , and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made  
the shock and outrage from the congregation grows , the questions keep coming , and he keeps shooting back honest , if ugly , answers  
 ( before i go further , i'd like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make , and that is that characterizing african-americans as malt-liquor drinking o  j  
fans is not part of bulworth's "" truth  "" 
that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie  
when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics , this line is not what they're talking about  ) 
the experience is liberating  
with nothing left to lose , bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth  
he can say whatever he wants because he's going to be dead anyway  
why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician - that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists , and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism ? 
bulworth's candor wins him three volunteers from the church , one of whom , nikki ( halle barry ) , he gets a crush on  
he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something  
chicken wings , appropriately enough  
bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives  
when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings , bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment  
with so much money and so many talented people working so hard , he wonders , why can't hollywood make a quality product  
 ( you go , warren ! ) 
when they become indignant and ask why he's talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product , he callously admits that it's because they are rich jews  
that night he drops the three african-american volunteers at their nightclub , and he decides to go in with them  
he stays up all night drinking , smoking pot , dancing , falling in love with nikki , and learning to scratch turntables and rap "

rated r , stars ) 
had "" hedwig and the angry inch "" came out in the '70s , right after david bowie's "" ziggy stardust , "" it likely would now be regarded as one of the most popular rock musicals of all time  
released in the 500 channel , sensory overload world of 2001 , however , the big screen adaptation of the acclaimed off-broadway musical must do battle with countless other productions clamoring for attention  
i almost missed it  
every august , the major studios try to squeeze the last few dollars out of summer moviegoers by dumping all of their shakier offerings on the marketplace at once  
i was so busy trying to keep up with national releases like "" summer catch "" and "" bubble boy "" that i passed over any independent film that looked like it would only have a short local run  
but an e-mail from a reader asking why i hadn't reviewed the movie prompted me to make a late evening trip to the theater  
thank goodness for readers like him  
 "" hedwig and the angry inch "" is a gender-bending glam-rock spectacular packed with great songs  
stylistically , the hook-laden tunes are reminiscent of bowie , "" bat out of hell "" era meatloaf and "" the rocky horror show , "" without ever seeming like imitations  
as with "" tommy , "" "" hedwig "" tells a story of isolation , pain and defiance , but without the bloated feel of that beloved , but overrated rock opera  
writer-director-star john cameron mitchell and composer-lyricist stephen trask have cooked up a real winner  
mitchell stars as hedwig , a singer from east berlin touring a chain of u  s  coffee shops with her pan-slavic band , the angry inch  
while the patrons of the run-down restaurants look on in shock , and sometimes horror , hedwig boldly tells the sad story of her life in song  
she was once a boy named hansel ( ben mayer-goodman ) , living with his mother ( alberta watson ) and listening to rock and roll on american armed forces radio  
life is an exercise in duality for hansel  
a wall splits his hometown into two parts  
mother describes love as the emotion that comes when you find your other half  
as hansel grows up , the duality becomes more pronounced  
after initially mistaking him for a girl , a gi from the states ( maurice dean wint ) falls in love with hansel and wants to marry him  
alas , hansel will never pass the mandatory physical  
mother helpfully suggests a sex change , but the operation goes bad , hence the references to "" the angry inch "" ( yes , i know this part is squirm-inducing , but stick with me - it's worth it )  
several years later , mr  right is long gone and hansel becomes hedwig , decked out in a farrah fawcett-style wig and fronting a band made up of korean women  
hedwig finds a new love in tommy ( michael pitt ) , a beatific lad with a unique take on christianity  
but tommy does hedwig wrong , stealing her songs and becoming a superstar  
cut to the present  
tommy gnosis' stadium tour is thriving and hedwig is suing him  
despite warnings from her manager ( andrea martin ) that she could easily be labeled a stalker , hegwig and her new band , the angry inch , continue their coffee shop tour , shadowing the thief by playing whatever city he is in  
if this sounds like a bizarre premise for a rock musical , take a few seconds and consider the plotlines of "" tommy "" and "" rocky horror  "" 
as hedwig , john cameron mitchell does a magnificent job taking a character that could have simply been a caricature or an icon and turning her into a compelling human being  
mitchell has world-class style and vocal chords to match "

1,"imagine this  
you're given a sword and a shield and very basic , minimal training  
a man you don't know tells you that this will be the last day that you will live  
you are thrown into an arena with thousands of spectators wanting to see you die  
you frantically monitor several closed doors which , in seconds , will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you  
you watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few days are murdered in cold blood  
if you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you , you know you're going to have to do it all over again tomorrow  
eventually know matter how strong or skilled you are , you're going to die  
this is the life of a gladiator  
you'll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing ridley scott's powerful gladiator , you'll be thankful for that  
with his new film , scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire  
and like those preceding it , spartacus and ben hur , gladiator has nearly everything going for it - a strong lead actor , a wonderful supporting cast , eye-catching special effects , and a great script  
since the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator ( teenagers to thirty-year-old males ) were around , a whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited  
>from a weak beginning , the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious  
rome's best general maximus ( russell crowe ) , who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted , is currently ( in the year 180 a  d  that is ) waging a war against germania  
scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style , similar to that of saving private ryan but much less effective  
it's blurry , in slow motion , and the sound is muted  
as soon as this artistic method began , it was hard to tell what was what and who was who  
it's a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch  
instead , the general swears he will get out after this battle  
he wants to go back to his family and his crops , he wants a quiet life  
but , unexpectedly , he gets anything but that  
the dying emperor of rome , marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies  
he asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more power to the senators  
all of this does not go well for aurelius' son , commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor  
jealous and upset , commodus kills his own father , names himself emperor , kills maximus' wife and son , and attempts to kill maximus  
but maximus is able to escape his own death and vows to kill commodus and fulfill marcus aurelius' wishes  
now a slave , the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator , who eventually are released for their success  
a story of betrayal and promises , gladiator is more than just a mindless action flick  
you actually care about the characters , sometimes even the evil villain commodus , who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way  
phoenix plays his character brilliantly  
think of commodus as the percy wetmore ( of pant-wetter the green mile ) of the roman empire - a whiny , sleazy , "" respect-me-because-my-father-was-a-good-man "" brat who hates when he's not the center of attention  
every scene we see commodus , he's either crying or he looks like he has just been crying  
phoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die for , and gladiator shows he's more than just river's little brother  
crowe is also excellent as the film's grisly-faced hero  
maximus is one of the few characters in recent cinema who actually has emotions  
this guy actually acts like a anyone in his situation would act , he's no invincible superhero who only blurts out one-liners , he ( believe it or not ) acts like a human being ! 
the rest of the cast , including richard harris , djimon hounsou , walter hill , derek jacobi , and connie nielsen are also first rate "

1,"john sayles' "" men with guns "" is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power  
the film takes place in an unnamed central american country , where the men with guns are the rulers  
most of the country is divided into tiny segments - some are controlled by guerrillas with guns , some are controlled by army soldiers with guns , and all the spaces in-between are controlled by thieves , bandits , and terrorists  
all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness  
however , like so many central american countries , this one also features modernity  
there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization : skyscrapers , hospitals , televisions , highways , etc  but , it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land , or else they are simply ignorant of it  
the film's main character , dr  fuentes ( federico luppi ) falls into the latter category  
one of his patients , an army general , describes him as the most educated man he has ever met , and also the most naive  
fuentes is a true liberal , a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians  
with government assistance , he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate  
this program was to be his legacy , and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea  
however , when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot ? g ? s , he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned  
as he travels deeper into the forest , going from village to village , the story is always the same : the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers , usually for helping the other  
when dr  fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors , she replies simply , "" because they had guns , and we didn't  "" 
rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns , because others' sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power  
dr  fuentes picks up several companions during his journey , all of whom are characterized by their loss  
first , there is a young boy named conejo ( dan rivera gonz ? lez ) , who has neither a mother nor a father  
next , fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo ( dami ? n delgado ) , who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities  
through his ordeal in the army , domingo has lost most of his self-respect , and defines himself only by his pistol  
along the way , the group also picks up padre portillo ( dami ? n alc ? zar ) , a priest who has lost his faith  
as domingo is running from the army , so is portillo - he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer , and ran away from the village in which he was preaching  
last , the group takes on a mute girl named graciela ( tania cruz ) , who hasn't spoken since she was raped two years earlier , her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her  
sayles two major strengths as a director - characters and setting - are abundantly evident in "" men with guns  "" 
 ( like many of his films , sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room , but a longer-than-necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor  ) 
he creates fascinating , complex characters , especially dr  fuentes and domingo  
their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film's overarching theme of violence as power - domingo's attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes' belief that the revolver is unloaded ( at first it is , but later is isn't )  
the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself  
sayles knows how to bring a location to life , whether it be an early twentieth-century coal mining town in "" matewan "" ( 1987 ) or a contemporary texas/mexico bordertown in "" lone star "" ( 1996 )  
sayles is not a particularly inventive director - he likes to let his actors do most of the work - but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak ( "" gattaca "" ) successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain  
sayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico , using all latin american actors , and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects  
the one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief , but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border  
it would not be a stretch to say that "" men with guns "" is a depressing film  
in fact , the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure  
in addition to loss , the main characters are also failures at something , whether that be dr "

1,"confession time : i have never , ever seen gone with the wind  
i don't know why , really  
haven't wanted to check it out on video , haven't been at home the nights it was on network tv , and it was too far to drive the last time it was on the big-screen  
so right up front , i'll admit that i don't know what the heck i'm talking about , but here goes    
is titanic the gone with the wind of the 1990's ? 
maybe that's going a little bit too far  
as good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie , they're no clark gable and vivien leigh  
but    
the parallels are there  
gwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available -- technicolor  
titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors  
gwtw places america's greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story , titanic does the same with the atlantic's most legendary tragedy  
they both have strong-willed redheaded heroines , they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slaves/steerage bums , they were both incredibly expensive and popular    
ok , maybe that's not enough parallels  
so titanic's not in gwtw's league  
no matter  
titanic is a great movie in its own right , complete with spills , thrills and ( especially ) chills  
much has been made of the humongous cost of the production , and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again  
the money was obviously well-spent  
the costumes look great , the sets look great , the cgi graphics look great  
i especially liked the expensive little touches , like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks  
but writer/director/producer james cameron's real challenge in writing/directing/ producing titanic wasn't just costuming and set design and special effects  
cameron's major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in  
he succeeds masterfully  
cameron does two things that work incredibly well  
first , he shows us modern-day salvage operations on titanic ( that's just "" titanic "" , not "" the titanic "" , mind you )  
the first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state , corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic , from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton )  
television coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues 101-year-old rose calvert ( gloria stuart ) , who survived the wreck in 1912  
stuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role , narrating the story of her experience to a stunned paxton and his roughneck crew  
secondly , cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character , and the romantic triangle between rose ( winslet ) , her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley ( billy zane ) and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon ( dicaprio )  
the way that big-budget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an all-star cast , so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people  
cameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack , while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board  
the supporting cast is professional , but mostly anonymous -- other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown , there's no moment when you stop and say , oh , yeah , i know him , what's he been in  
 ( although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform , or even as the ill-fated engineer "

1,"jake kasdan , son of one of the best screenwriters around , breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hard-to-categorize detective story : part mystery , part comedy , part character study and part romance  
for the most part , kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film  
daryl zero ( bill pullman ) is a modern day sherlock holmes  
the parallel is present down to his love of music ( though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin ) , and his addiction to drugs ( amphetamines , rather than morphine )  
he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces , the case about the man who lied about his age , or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes  
however zero's observance of the fine art of detachment , though it makes him a brilliant private investigator , makes him somewhat of a self-imposed outcast in society  
he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr  watson , i mean steve arlo ( ben stiller )  
arlo is not happy with his job  
he is thrilled to be around zero's brilliance , but his bizarre behavior , and strange requests , are frustrating to the former lawyer  
and they're even more so to his girlfriend , jess ( angela featherstone ) , who is fed up that her boyfriend's boss means more to arlo than her  
this is the situation when a new case comes knocking  
gregory stark ( ryan o'neill ) hires zero to find his lost keys  
it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring , and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence  
now , stark is being blackmailed , and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end  
to solve this case , zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell  
however , this is when he is vulnerable    and 
this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic , gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) , who may be involved in the blackmail scheme  
for the first time , zero has to question his own objectivity , as he finds his client less and less sympathetic  
zero effect is weakest in its obviously "" wacky "" scenes depicting daryl zero's odd behavior  
such scenes might be appropriate in an out-and-out satire , making zero an ace ventura-ish character  
however , there's a much meatier movie in here    it just takes a while to get out  
that's not to say that there's not a place for humor in this film  
in fact , some of the best scenes are ben stiller's wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer  
however , the over-the-top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film , and they aren't funny enough to stand on their own  
once the investigation is underway , however , zero's brilliance really begins to shine  
his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlock's own  
as the mystery begins to unfold , zero's deductions lead the plot in interesting directions , but never lose the viewer  
zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well  
zero's relationship with gloria is low-key , but it hits all the right notes  
however , we are always kept distant from gloria's character  
she's given plenty of development , but we never understand what she is thinking  
perhaps that may be intentional : to place the audience in zero's zone of detachment  
but , on the whole , it is frustrating "

in a desert settlement , hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town , there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals and the handful of white settlers who live nearby  
the local police officer has the task of enforcing "" white man's justice "" to the aboriginals  
these are people with a proud 40 , 000 year heritage behind them  
naturally , this includes their own system of justice ; key to which is "" payback ""  
an eye for an eye  
revenge  
usually extracted by the spearing through of the recipient's thigh  
brown , as the officer , manages quite well to keep the balance  
he admits that he has to 'bend the rules' a bit , including actively encouraging at least one brutal "" payback ""  
 ( be warned that this scene , near the start , is not for the squeamish )  
the local priest - an aboriginal , but in the "" white fellas "" church - has a foot on either side of the line  
he is , figuratively and literally , in both camps  
ernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as the man in the middle  
he is part churchman and part politician  
however the tension , like the heat , flies and dust , is always there  
whilst her husband - the local teacher - is in church , white lady kate ( milliken ) and her aborginal friend tony , ( pedersen ) have gone off into the hills  
he takes her to a sacred site , even today strictly men-only  
she appears to not know this  
tony tells her that this is a special place , an initiation place  
he then makes love to her , surrounded by ancient rock art  
the community finds out about this sacrilegious act and it's payback time  
the fuse is lit and the brittle inter-racial peace is shattered  
everyone is affected in the fall out  
to say more is to give away the details of this finely crafted film  
suffice to say it's a rewarding experience  
bryan brown , acting and co-producing , is the pivotal character  
his officer is real , human and therefore flawed  
brown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards the man , then suddenly feel angry about him  
it wasn't long ago that i visited central australia - ayers rock ( uluru ) and alice springs - for the first time  
the wide-screen cinematography shows the dead heart of australia in a way that captures it's vicious beauty , but never deteriorates into a moving slide show , in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground "
1,"rated : r for strong language , sexual dialogue , drug use , crude humor , violence and brief nudity  
starring : ben affleck , matt damon , linda fiorentino , salma hayek , alan rickman , chris rock , kevin smith , jason mewes , jason lee , george carlin , alanis morissette  
running time : 130 minutes 
being a huge fan of kevin smith , i was expecting a lot out of his newest project 'dogma'  
it might just be kevin's best work to date  
it's very funny with smart and foul-mouthed dialogue while unexpectedly it has a serious undertone to it and besides going against god and jesus christ , it actually tries to tell people that there is such a thing rather than that there isn't  
in 1994 a little $27 , 000 movie premiered at sundance  
this little film was called 'clerks' and this little film went on to become a huge video sensation  
you really can't meet a person on this green earth who has not seen 'clerks'  
it was hailed by critics as one of the best movies of the year and soon a sequel is coming  
in 1995 kevin made another movie 'mallrats' that flopped horribly , thought it was not the best movie ever made it was a pretty good little flick  
it was panned by critics but hailed by audiences and in 1997 'chasing amy' came out and was kevin's biggest success to date  
now in 1999 we get a great little movie by the name of 'dogma'  
wow ! what a cast  
ok here is the plot in this movie : linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic  
one day at her house metatron ( the voice of god ) appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels ( matt damon and ben affleck ) from getting back into heaven by ways of a church  
ok now get this , she is told to find two prophets : one who talks a lot and one who doesn't , however she gets jay and silent bob instead ( who give us great performances )  
now on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls out of the sky ( chris rock ) and helps guide her to find these angels  
salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way  
azrael ( jason lee ) who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win  
bethany ( linda fiorentino ) has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith  
what a movie , it is everything rolled into one : an offensive , offbeat , smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end , and ends up being a feel-good movie  
who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself  
now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart  
yes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot , but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven , it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god  
this review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie  
kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie  
of course the best ( and funniest ) of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob  
probably the best characters in movies that i like  
the star-studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin , jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while  
the script was written by kevin smith with many f'words in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what isn't and makes us laugh at the same time as we think  
chris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well , with some classic lines  
linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is  
of course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay ( as well as silent bob )  
alan rickman , jason lee , salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles  
being oscar winners for the classic 'good will hunting' they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could  
ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story  
the movie's only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it  
however the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members , 'dogma' stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to 'clerks'  
while being funny at times , in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but can't deny it "
1,"seen september 13 , 1998 at 4 p  m at rotterdam square mall cinema 6 , theater #2 , with chris wessell for free using my sony/loews critic's pass  
[theater rating : * * 1/2 : good seats , average sound , picture unstable] 
 "" rounders "" is exactly the kind of movie parents don't want their kids to see  
it's not that it's a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it's a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling  
and to take make things "" worse "" it proves this through its original , fascinating story  
there have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the "" noir "" mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life  
this film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing  
matt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20-something law student in present-day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played  
damon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting  
mike's about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer  
but then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally )  
damon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together  
he never sounds like he's reading from a script , nor that he's trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him  
the screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite  
immediately we get the sense that poker isn't for gamblers , but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel  
the game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers  
the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man  
the film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act  
it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit  
we learn only a little about mike , both past and present  
presently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling  
they go through a few break-up/make-up cycles until mike's childhood pal and fellow rounder "" worm "" ( norton ) is released from prison  
it's not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does  
technically , the plot isn't unlike many children's sitcoms in which the "" good "" kid's "" bad "" friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid  
what this film does is use a different medium to tell that story  
mike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out-thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them  
where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he's dealt and works with them  
sometimes they pay off ( i  e  
his ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they don't ( i  e  
the fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $30 , 000 on a single hand )  
once things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood  
mike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places , from socialites' mansions , to taking the tourists at atlantic city , to outwitting the gangsters that control it all  
everything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything's a battle against the cards destiny deals  
one scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge ( martin landou , in a perfectly cast and performed role ) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time  
matt's good at gambling but he's also got potential to be a great lawyer  
he could go professional as either , but with one he could lose everything or win big , but with the other there's stability but not much risk involved  
can someone who's gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave ? 
if the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker-playing , then the ending is our test "

[theater rating : * * 1/2 : okay seats , sound , and picture] 
modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes  
the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it  
 "" your friends and neighbors "" takes a different approach as it's a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends  
one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute's basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story  
firstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras  
everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full-circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative  
but to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult  
labute's ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what's specifically impressive is the fact the characters' names are never revealed until the end credits roll  
for the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic  
another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus  
we're always able to tell where the characters are ( someone's home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc  ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc  is relatively unknown  
the film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater  
no one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background  
we're simply dropped in on the characters' lives and are expected to figure out the rest  
the characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they're only concern right now seems to be their sex lives  
first there's barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don't know what they're problem is  
barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn't have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else  
mary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn't hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something  
labute's script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two  
obviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow  
another couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything  
their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship  
if only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area  
it's natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ? 
what did they ever see in the other person to begin with ? 
labute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it's fascinating  
two other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski )  
cary is an arrogant , hostile sex-maniac who defines the word "" bastard  "" 
somehow he is able to bend women to his will , either through charm or just attitude , into getting his way  
he's the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he's secretly perverted , but somehow barry finds comfort in his company , although jerry is always nervous around him  
patric gives an outstanding performance , so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is  
cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her  
she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another  
she's a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable  
i will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others' action , as that's the hook of the film  
the first two acts begin to set up the characters and each's scenarios , but it's often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom "
1,"so here is the second of 1999's remakes of classic horror movies  
the first was the dumb , pathetic but ok remake of the classic 'the haunting'  
now comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill  
the classic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people 100 , 000 to stay in his house  
if they survive the night they get the money  
if not well you get the jurisdiction  
having not yet seen the film ( dvd on its way ) i wasn't sure if i would really like the remake  
but sure enough it comes through and has a great storyline to fall back on  
geoffrey rush ( in a fantastic role with an incredible performance ) is steven price , the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people  
his wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends  
steven dismays at the idea and makes his own list  
somehow someone , or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party  
eddie ( taye diggs ) an ex-baseball player , sarah ( ali carter ) an ex-assistant who can re-wire anything , melissa ( brigette wilson ) a talk-show host in sorts , dr  blackburn ( peter ghallager ) , and watson ( chris kattan ) a smart-mouthed humorist in ways  
what he is gonna do is pay these five people 1 , 000 , 000 dollars if they can survive through the night  
if they can they get the money , if not well they don't  
the house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum  
years before mental patients broke out and killed the dr  there , forcing him to lock the place up because if he died , so did they  
everyone who was in there burned to death  
now it is steven price's home and he is throwing this party for these five people  
what starts out as a seemingly normal night , turns into a horrifying , blood splattering night  
the deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed  
one-by-one the people start to disappear  
conspiracies start to turn up , and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all  
the people find rooms , which once held mental patients  
rooms which once had people dying  
rooms which may still contain these people  
now these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house , and they must survive each other with terrorfying results  
since i officially haven't seen the original i can't say which is better  
i can say however i liked this movie  
geoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as the rich steven price , and does a great job doing a vincent price role  
famke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times  
ali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs  
chris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines  
peter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims  
the plot was well conceived and was very absorbing  
the movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy , and even sometimes downright scary  
i found even the opening credits to me a little ominous "

1,"capsule : this is a 1950s or 1960s style heist film , set in the present  
robert deniro stars as a risk-adverse safecracker who wants to retire form crime but takes one last job at the request of a personal friend ( played by marlon brando )  
edward norton plays a hotshot young sharpster who is also in on the crime  
the plot is mostly straightforward suspense with little nonsense  
 , +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
i am sure i must have seen almost the identical plot before  
this is a heist film made for an adult audience who probably wanted a crime film like they had seen in theaters when they were teens  
there are no superhuman acrobats taking nosedives off of buildings like in entrapment  
there is no rock score  
there are no ballet- like martial arts  
this is just a basic heist film with a decent and distinctly credible and un-flashy script  
nick ( played by robert deniro ) is a safecracker who has managed to be successful by never taking risks  
if a job is not a safe bet ( pun intended ) , he backs out  
sometimes even the safe bets turn out not to be so safe  
when one job very nearly goes wrong nick is unnerved enough to decide that it is nature telling him that it is time to get out of the game  
he returns to his home in montreal where he owns a jazz club , and decides to manage it full time  
he proposes to his girl friend diane ( angela bassett )  
she has one condition  
he must stay retired from crime  
but before the deal can be cemented , max , a montreal kingpin and personal friend , has one last supposedly easy job for nick  
nick wants no part particularly because the heist will be right in his hometown of montreal  
more and more details seem to complicate the job  
nick's partner in the crime is to be a smart , but uncontrollable young crook , jack ( edward norton )  
jack treats a locked front door like a welcome mat , even at his associates' homes  
the young crook is a know-it-all who seems good at everything he does but at avoiding rubbing people the wrong way  
together they plan to steal a priceless historic artifact from the montreal customs house  
the script by kario salem , lem dobbs , and scott marshall smith works like an episode of the old "" mission impossible "" television series  
we see pieces of the heist being put together , last minute changes , and things that go wrong , much like a good episode of "" mission impossible  "" 
this team might not be bad choices to write scripts for the tom cruise "" mission impossible "" films  
the complications are , however no more and no fewer than are needed to make the story believable  
the telling is cold and noirish , which is just what it is supposed to be  
director frank oz , the voices of yoda and miss piggy proves surprisingly good at directing a serious crime film  
the score has a more than adequate cast with little flashy or scene-stealing acting  
edward norton probably has the flashiest role and even that is low-key by today's standards  
he plays what is nearly a double role  
jack pretends to be a brain damage victim to be hired for a job in the customs house  
one nice ( ? ) 
character i have not mentioned is stephen ( jamie harrold )  
stephen is a master hacker who lives in his mother's basement in a house with a lot of screaming in both directions  
he seems like the last person the risk adverse nick would want to depend upon  
the film itself remains low-key up until the time of the climactic heist "

based on the 1934 film death takes a holiday , meet joe black is a well acted romantic drama which explores the meanings of life and love  
william parrish ( anthony hopkins ) is a billionaire businessman on the brink of his 65th birthday  
he has built a huge media empire , and raised two beautiful daughters , allison ( marcia gay harden ) and susan ( claire forlani )  
william has been able to negotiate his way out of many tough spots    but he has suddenly begun fearing his own mortality , the one situation he won't be able to talk his way out of  
and he has good reason to fear , for death himself is stalking him  
however , death has a deal to make  
death has taken possession of a man who has recently died ( brad pitt ) , and wants william to be his guide in a holiday among the living  
in return , william gets to live a few extra days  
of course , he agrees  
death , under the human name of "" joe black "" , gets to experience life as a complete innocent  
he never before has experienced the simple pleasures of a springy matters or peanut butter  
and he's not quite compared for the more complex pleasures when he and susan fall in love  
but , is their affair doomed to an early demise ? 
at nearly three hours in length , meet joe black is a little bit on the leisurely side , though it never gets boringly lengthy  
instead , the film gets a chance to develop some nicely textured characters and situations  
you get to soak in and enjoy the atmosphere , rather than being hurriedly rushed through it  
the romantic angle works well , though , surprisingly , the interactions between joe black and william parrish are more interesting than those with his daughter  
this is most likely due to anthony hopkins , who once again displays his superb acting skills  
william is a desperate man who has had a seemingly ideal life , and doesn't want to let it go  
by contrast , claire forlani is merely the romantic interest  
she gets to show joe the ropes of love , but is hardly as interesting a character  
as joe black , brad pitt seems a bit stilted  
granted , he's supposed to be out-of-place , but the overly formal technique used by pitt begins to distract from the role  
still , he is able to hold his own , and over the course of the three hours , his character begins to grow on you  
the main character who seems out of place here is drew ( jake weber ) , an ambitious executive in williams' company who is joe black's main rival for susan's affections  
weber plays the character with a hammy relish reminiscent of snidley whiplash  
this cartoonish foil an aberration in a film filled many more dimensional characters  
the supernatural elements of the film are handled murkily , but never distractingly so  
we never learn what is the exact nature of death , or why he's never done something like this before  
it actually gets a bit creepy when death talks to the dying in their own voices/accents  
 ( his initial conversations with hopkins sound shockingly like hannibal lecter    ) 
and the ultimate resolution to one of the film's supernatural problems seems , well , somewhat superficial  
still , even with the film's length , it was a pleasant time at the movies , something you wouldn't necessarily expect from a film about death  "

1,"glory--starring matthew broderick , denzel washington , and morgan freeman--is the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts , the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war  
broderick plays robert gould shaw , the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle  
shaw , the son of well-to-do abolitionists , hailed from boston high society  
the letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard , and were , evidently , the inspiration for glory  
as the film begins in 1862 , shaw is a captain in the northern forces  
like private eriksson ( michael j  fox ) in casualties of war , shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war--that is , until his company is attacked by enemy forces  
shaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle , witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck  
soon after his recovery , shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort  
glory is the story not only of colonel shaw , but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery  
the film periodically jumps between shaw's point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers  
the movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits , and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action  
the large black cast is uniformly outstanding , especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth  
he is brash and pushy , always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight  
his bitter , tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability  
washington provides much of the film's intensity and emotional power  
in one heartbreaking scene , he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army  
when he removes his shirt to receive the punishment , you cringe at the sight of his back , which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave  
it makes your blood boil  
the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings ; a tear rolls down washington's cheek--and will probably run down your cheek as well  
the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn't deserting the army at all ; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores  
freeman is , as usual , a strong presence , even in a small supporting role  
he plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember  
he quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers , holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers  
colonel shaw recognizes freeman's leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major , making him the first black officer in the army  
andre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles , a free black who is one of shaw's close childhood friends  
searles is educated and refined , like a white man , prompting washington to nickname him "" snow flake  "" 
the burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat  
the road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment  
the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships , but somehow they never lose their morale  
the army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens , subjecting them to racism and discrimination  
they are paid only $10 a month , whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen , and , for a long time , they have to go without shoes , guns , or uniforms  
to make matters worse , the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action , preferring instead to use them for manual labor  
eventually , however , the regiment receives its boots , uniforms , rifles , and right to fight , thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw  
shaw has absolute faith in his soldiers , and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve , even if it means threatening a general with blackmail  
broderick , in fact , is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment  
unfortunately , however , broderick's uneven performance is , in many respects , the weak link in the movie

mamoru oshii is a name that probably isn't very well-known to most american audiences , but perhaps it should be  
oshii was the director of last year's best-known japanese animated film import , _ghost in the shell_ , and is known among fans of japanese animation , or anime , for making films with a deep philosophical bent  
one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series  
in its many incarnations--graphic novels ( "" manga "" ) , two different runs of made-for-video episodes ( original animation videos , or oavs for short ) , and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes--patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan  
set in the very near future ( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived ) , this atypical giant robot anime features the characters , rather than the machinery , as the primary focus  
as a whole , patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan  
as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains , giant industrial robots , known as "" labors "" ( an interesting play on words , considering that "" robot "" is derived from the czech word for labor ) , have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century  
with the rise of labors , however , has come a new menace--labor crime  
this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions , using patrol labors to fight labor crime  
the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division , sv2 , who , through no fault of their own , have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness  
sometimes utterly hilarious , sometimes almost deadly serious , the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers , and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life  
those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie , although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers  
the story , as has much of patlabor before , centers around the controversial babylon project , a gigantic seawall that will , on its completion , allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay  
this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists , most notably the house of sea organization  
however , the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist , but from someone who is already dead    
shinohara heavy industries , the premier labor manufacturer in japan ( if not the whole world ) , has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors' movement speed and efficiency by 30%  
this hyper operating system , hos for short , has very quickly been installed into well over 90% of the nation's labors    including the patrol labors of sv2  
since that installation , dozens of labors , including a heavily-armed military model , have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason    and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos  
 ( some wags have compared this to windows 95  ) 
it's up to asuma shinohara , labor command officer with sv2 and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries , to find the source of these problems before more labors--including sv2's own--fall victim to them , and before hos drags his father's company down with it  
as was the case with _ghost in the shell_ , if you just want a no-brainer actionfest , this might not be the movie for you  
_patlabor : the movie_ is more of a psychological thriller , a technological suspense drama  
it is closer , perhaps , to a chrichton novel than to an action movie ( crichton novels that have been made _into_ action movies notwithstanding )  
there are long , thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo , similar to sequences from _ghost in the shell_  
this movie is fraught with symbolism--in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism  
patlabor's near-future setting is , aside from the giant robots tromping around , very similar to our own present day  
the film uses this setting to make its central point : is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up ? 
are history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new ? 
this is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor's alternate-1999 setting  
as far as the technical aspects of the film go ( referring to the subtitled version , as that's the only one i've seen ) , the film transfer is clear , almost phenomenally so  
the animation quality is incredible , though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to  
the oavs and tv series were more cheerful , better-suited to humor ; the movie , however , makes everyone look a great deal less cute , and emphasizes that this is going to be , for the most part , a deadly serious storyline  
as far as cinematography goes , there are many interesting moments in _patlabor : the movie_ "

[theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats , sound and picture] 
 ( critic's note : this review is the longest i've ever written and still only scratches the surface  
i'd recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis  ) 
as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ? 
never mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old  
never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released  
never mind that there's so much going on in this movie in terms of plot , action , special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn't cover everything  
and also like ted does in all of his reviews , i'll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader  
before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film , many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film , skip this and the next four paragraphs )  
as has been made obvious for the last several years , another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars' series ( the first of the films was actually episode four , not one )  
george lucas , the creator of the series , has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , ' `the empire strikes back' and `return of the jedi' ) is actually the second trilogy , chronologically  
in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can't recall his reasons  
with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err    
second trilogy    
well you know what i mean )  
and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which , unfortunately , may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution  
[critic's note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed , but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule  
critic's note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics' law of reviewing movies , which as roger ebert coined , `it's not what a movie is about , but how it is about it  ' 
because so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story  ] 
first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it  
we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire  
we know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side  ' 
we also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi )  
what we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth  
to me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity  
also , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended  
most notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine  
for those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least )  
with `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights  
unfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained  
i didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness "
1,"i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video  
it really scared me , and i didn't want to go see it  
however , after i heard about how wonderful it was , i wanted to see it  
i didn't get a chance to do so , until now  
the film , disney's 25th animated feature , opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale : a long time ago in the land of prydain , there was a king so evil , that his spirit was captured in the cauldron  
it has been hidden for centuries , and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors , and with them rule the world ? and destroy it  
then , we meet a farmer-wizard , dallben , and his young apprentice , taran  
taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a `pig-keeper' ( they have a pig named hen-wen )  
one day , as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath , the pig goes crazy , and dallben then realizes , after watching hen wen's thoughts through a bucket of water , that taran must hide hen wen in the forest  
an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron , and only hen wen has the power to show its location  
taran leads hen wen into the forest , but of course , he loses her , and tries to go find her  
along the way , he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi , who desires `munchings and crunchings' , much to his dismay ( besides , he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen )  
when he hears hen wen's squeal from far away , though , he races to her rescue ? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants  
taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king's castle from far away  
taran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen  
he manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon  
there , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls  
along the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie  
the three manage to escape the horned king's castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic  
as they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen's trail  
he leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of `pig tracks' , to a whirlpool  
suddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy-like fairfolk  
taran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva  
he then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world  
with the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage  
it turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place  
when taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ? in exchange for his sword  
taran agrees , much to eilonwy's horror , but at least they get the black cauldron  
but ? the cauldron can't be destroyed , only its evil powers can be stopped  
the only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive  
things take a turn for the worse when the horned king's henchmen capture taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr , along with the black cauldron , and lead them back to the castle  
taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors ( this is the most horrifying scene in the film , because here , a dead army comes alive ? )  
just when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr  
taran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away  
gurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay  
taran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king  
he kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely  
taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king's castle just as it self-destructs  
the witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they `never give anything away , they bargain' "

1,"who would have thought ? 
jim carrey does drama  
when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show , i thought , "" what a hilarious idea for a movie ! "" 
however , it was an even better premise for a drama  
the truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man  
that man is truman burbank ( jim carrey )  
truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly , cristof wants to keep it that way  
christof is the "" god "" of this made-up world  
he keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles  
there were a few attempts to tell truman about his world , but they failed and life went on as normal  
the opening parts of the film introduce to truman's world  
we see what he is doing at his current age , then we get a flashback at his past  
it may seem a tad boring , but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start  
the film can be described in one word : weird  
it seems like such a simple idea , yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of , but andrew niccol did  
it seems like a warped idea , but it is andrew's idea and he did wonders with it  
jim carrey actually lived up to the hype  
the hype , whether good or bad , always focused on carrey's ability to do drama  
no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be , the only thing they doubted was carrey  
and he showed them all up  
jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars  
i do not think he was the best actor , but he deserved the nomination  
he plays truman burbank , the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world  
he has lived a normal life for almost thirty years , but then strange things start happening  
he ventures into the wrong elevator  
a light crashes in front of him  
his father comes back and is then pulled away  
we are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show , but truman does not  
and it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish  
carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama  
laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife  
she plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point  
peter weir does not make the cast perfect , and their flaws eventually lead to truman's escape  
the story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down  
despite carrey's greatness , the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris , who plays the "" god "" of truman's world  
he displays the pressure he is under , the world he has created  
he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life  
the action moves at a good pace , and rarely gets sluggish  
but , the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show  
it really makes you think  
maybe your brother is an actor , maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show "

1,"magnolia left me relling from the theatre , staggering from the relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft  
at nearly three and a half hours , magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film  
it not only demands your attention , but challenges you to grasp the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden intentions  
it is delirious , depressing , heady , pretentious , surreal filmmaking  
it's also a movie that will polarize its viewers  
director paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast , wraps them in a net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in a symphony of despair whose song doesn't let up until an oddly exhilerating , biblically influenced pseudo-climax  
the character's make up a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives  
there is frank mackey ( tom cruise ) , a slithery snake charmer of men whose "" search and destroy "" seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her pants  
there is earl partridge ( jason robards ) , a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son  
there is game show host jimmy gator ( phillip baker hall ) , a self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than a few secrets from his public  
and there is police officer jim kurring ( john c  reilly ) , who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal system , perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision making process  
given equal weight are stories involving a coke-addled emotional cripple ( melora walters ) , a former tv quiz show champion ( william h  macy )  
a materialistic , adulterous wife ( julianne moore ) , a child ( jeremy blackman ) victimized by a mentally abusive parent , and a caring , empathetic nurse ( philip seymour hoffman )  
hovering over all these characters is a cloud of death , lies and despair  
it is not a pleasant movie  
there is not one bad note in the acting  
it is affecting and layered and wonderful  
there is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films  
then he tops himself with a mesmerizing deathbed scene  
walters plays her character with red-eyed rawness and a fierce self-destructiveness that is anxiety inducing  
robards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man , who still hears a lion's roar when he speaks  
director anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude to emote  
the problem is that he stays on them too long  
julianne moore's character , linda , quickly escalates to a frenzied pitch of guilt , tears , screaming and remorse and never backs off from it  
after a few hours , it turns from interesting to chinese water torture  
quite a few scenes , such as the game show , go on just a bit too long and will be off-putting for those used to a pat 90 minute film where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed it the first go around  
and just what is the theme ? 
alienation ? 
hopelessness ? 
anderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions and he doesn't make it easy  
the film starts by showing three , strange and seemingly unrelated events  
it's a harbinger of the synchronicity to come  
at times , different stories reach reach key moments at the same time  
other times , stories seem to veer off into uncharted territory , regardless of what else is happening  
anderson is audacious enough to even have a group sing in the middle of the film ! 
what's surprising is that it mostly works  
if you have doubts about anderson's intentions , i'll ask you to pay attention to the final frame  
despite all the sturm und drang , magnolia ultimately speaks to man's capacity for hope and attempts at redemption  
despite magnolia's needlessly long running time and its propensity for uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur , showing off fro the masses , i have to admire his guts  
this is truly adventurous filmmaking that spits in the face of conventional storytelling  
my rating : a bulleye "

1,"big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america  
o  j  
simpson , tom capano , the menendez brothers  
all these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms  
and , of course , courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood  
whether it be john grisham's thrilling novels or television's famous dramas , the courtroom has always provided big bucks  
so when i rented a civil action , i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker , a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat  
however , what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected , a major surprise , but fortunately , a pleasant one  
john travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it  
no one expected him to light up the screen in grease , nor in saturday night fever  
but , whenever he gets knocked down , he always seems to come back fighting  
a civil action is not john's best performance , but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998  
travolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations  
his performance is not flashy , nor memorable , just solid  
if he delivered the only solid performance , this film would still be average  
luckily , he has a strong supporting cast  
william h  macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood  
he continues to deliver great performances one after the other , but he is still regarded as a secondary actor  
in a civil action , he delivers yet another great performance as travolta's paranoid and greedy accountant  
he is not a lovable character , but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film  
he is not one of the big time lawyers , just a measly accountant  
but , he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998 , but there is actually someone better in a civil action  
robert duvall is also an underrated actor  
he gets many leading roles , but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks , brad pitt and jim carrey  
duvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the co-defendant  
duvall is magical in this role  
he is the wise teacher , who not only battles it out in the courtroom , but also manages to teach every major player a lesson , in his own twisted way  
in many non-comedic films , directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy , to keep the audience on their toes  
unfortunately , they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny ( jar-jar binks , anyone ? )  
however , this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed  
this is not the case in a civil action  
they have comedy coming from all sides  
whether it be duvall's inane questions or macy's sharp anger , the laughs come in a steady pace  
granted , it's not roll in the aisle funny , but it provides a nice addition to the film  
the plot is terrific- somewhat  
the setup is nice with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom  
then the case that will make or break jan ( travolta ) 's career rears its ugly head "

1,"set in the late 80's at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis ( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie , less than zero ) , american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie "" genre "" that ellis helped to create  
christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman , a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc ? e and his colleagues  
it seems that bateman is a serial killer and , unfortunately for his contemporaries , his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip  
as he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co-workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies , his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel  
i was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school  
i read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it  
as usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out , but i soon forgot about the novel and didn't end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore  
i picked it up and read it , but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers  
the movie has a similar effect , but at least it's less cryptic than ellis' novel  
for once , a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on  
both the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations ( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses ) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout  
the movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman's impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does  
as a result , the film is immensely more entertaining  
lions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films ( having picked up kevin smith's catholic-rattling dogma ) and here with american psycho there is no difference  
screenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it  
some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc-17 , mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women , and initial reports said the film was unwatchable  
thankfully , it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park : bigger , longer & uncut  
side note #1 : co-writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill-fated acquaintance of bateman's who , after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute , proclaims that she's not a lesbian nor has any interest in it  
the ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner ( the writer/director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy ) is a lesbian  
it's a subtle in-joke and it's one i found to be pretty humorous  
despite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up-and-comers ( including reese witherspoon ) , most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos  
the real draw here is christian bale and his over-the-top performance as patrick bateman  
whenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters  
i always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman , but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being  
to say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he's as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger  
one sequence in particular , involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news' song "" hip to be square "" right before burying an axe in a co-worker's head , features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film  
side note #2 : despite the fact that huey lewis' "" hip to be square "" and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film , don't expect to see them on the soundtrack release  
huey lewis expressly requested that his song , featured in a rather large set piece in the film ( much akin to the use of "" stuck in the middle with you "" in reservoir dogs ) , not be included on any soundtrack release  
i'm assuming that collins requested the same  
on a similar note , whitney houston's cover of "" the greatest love of all "" is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn't the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source  
apparently , houston wasn't as open about the use of her song as the others were  
a bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film's release : that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film  
don't look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more  
several web sites have been dedicated to the subject but i'm still undecided  
there is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops , old ladies , and cleaning staff with equal gusto  
the scene seemed very dream-like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying ( as an example , bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car )  
i kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there , but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence , though comic , throws the film off-balance ( which i suppose was the intention )  
other than the few flaws i have mentioned , american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film ( although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman's reality )  
i think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such "

he's proud of , and amazed by , will's accomplishments in mathematics  
he encourages will and tries to give him structure , knowing that , with a little discipline , he could be bigger than einstein  
will isn't really interested in academia  
he knows he would be the best in his field , and therefore spend all of his time in an office , explaining math to people like lambeau  
he would rather work construction , which breaks lambeau's heart  
meanwhile , will attends his mandated therapy sessions  
it's not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau's "" a "" list  
will has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade , and how to keep them from affecting him  
shrink after shrink refuses to return after will's mockery  
lambeau's last hope is his old college roommate , now a psychology teacher at a small-time community college  
knowing that will is going to try to shred him too , sean ( robin williams ) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein  
true to form , will finds sean's emotional weakness and attacks  
but unlike the other shrinks , sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions  
like a foster mother with a fussy child , sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride  
like the foster mother , sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach  
robin williams is excellent in this role  
he's not an actor with a great range , but in the right roles he has great depth  
in this movie , as in awakenings , there comes a point when the quiet , shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance , and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes  
williams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling  
i have compared will to a foster child and that's not entirely fair  
emotionally , he has a lot to learn , but he is not a child "
1,"an energetic , visually stunning , but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne d'arc  
in history jeanne d'arc is lost in an ocean of mystery and controversy , which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and creative directors , who can basically alter the story as they wish  
she came in a time where people desperately needed a saint  
a hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and happiness  
director/writer luc besson ( 'nikita' , 'leon' ) portrays his version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france and was burned at the stake for witchcraft  
besson tries to recreate the person behind the legend  
he tries not to show her as a saint or a villain  
he shows her as a human being  
in a time where blood was almost pouring from the sky , and the air smelled of rotten flesh , it is hard to keep your sanity  
the only support and hope is in god  
at the age of 13 , jeanne ( milla jovovich ) watches her own sister murdered and raped by the english soldiers  
this terrible event makes a lasting impact on jeanne's mind  
god is no longer her support  
he has become her obsession  
she starts seeing visions and signs that command her to raise an army and free france from the siege of the english tyranny  
with the help of the wise yolande d'aragon ( faye dunaway ) and charles vii ( john malcovich ) , whose grand royal ambitions and life are at stake , jeanne raises an army and marches towards the english walls  
after this the film stays mostly on the battlefield , where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing action sequences , only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo  
the movie is filled with dreamy , symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship , that create a surreal and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere  
the film is lost in time and space , hysterically jumping back and forth in jeanne's thoughts , imagination and conscience  
besson's visual style permits the audience to enter the medieval age , feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle  
but the film is far from being flawless  
the script needs a lot of polishing  
except for jeanne , there are no real characters  
and although a grand star cast is assembled , their characters are nothing more than props , not more alive than the costumes that they are wearing  
as for the maiden of lorraine herself , she is portrayed as a simple girl , too small for her divine task  
in the latter part of the film , we see her as hysterical , confused and on the brink of madness , with her past purity and innocence for ever lost  
jovovich handles the part with more panache than one might expect  
but though her screen time is incredible excessive , both malcovich ( 'being john malcovich' ) and dunaway ( 'titus' ) surpass her rather overacted and simply unprofessional performance  
and even hoffman manages to breathe some life into his dreadfully small part  
besides casting jovovich , besson's only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting  
there are some viscously evil englishmen that murder , pillage and betray with a smile on their faces  
and some incredibly brave and noble frenchmen , represented by the "" three musketeers "" of this story -- the brave gilles de rais ( vincent cassel ) , the wise aulon ( desmond harrington ) and the strong la hire ( richard ridings )  
though all those actor perform well , their characters are nothing more than symbols -- banners that proclaim the glory of france  
and thus , there is no sense of realism in this film  
'the messenger' has muscles instead of brains  
there is some relief in the end , where besson lays down his armor and starts thinking  
dustin hoffman's appearance helps and the film ends elegantly and surprisingly effective with a climax worthy of praise  
jeanne's character is unlocked , but whether god was in the picture or not , is never quite explained  
was she a confused peasant girl driven by her own hunger for revenge ? 
or was she truly a messenger of god ? 
the film poses as many questions as answers and nothing is completely obvious "

1,"john von neumann , progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project , pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos , even without recourse to faster-than light travel  
you send out self-replicating robot ships which explore and radio back information  
it may take decades , centuries , or millennia , but it can be done with achievable technology , and doesn't require a magical faster-than-light drive  
in the fifties , british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it ; any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer , which would then engage in a real-time dialog with the aliens , exchanging information and technologies , and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned  
about thirty-five years ago , the bbc contracted with astronomer/writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini-series called a for andromeda  
afa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission , the construction of a huge computer , the computer's analysis of life on earth , and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication  
she was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then-unknown julie christie  
audience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel , andromeda breakthrough , which played to equally high ratings  
dennis feldman , whose previous credits include the golden child , has never been noted for coherent , well-structured movie scripts ; they start out great , and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action , mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl  
feldman writes good scenes , but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie , even with a previous version to use as a model  
now , in species , we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline , derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter , gore , and chases  
species features ben kingsley , who is completely wasted in a badly-written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist  
forest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script  
the species story is relatively simple ; we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since 1971 , and have been receiving answers for two years  
 ( note that , in the 1970's , we really didn't know diddly about the human genome structure , and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings  
even today , all we can do is give information about dna and how it works , not a copy of human dna , because we don't have it analyzed yet  ) 
the answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race , and doctor xavier finch , played by ben kingsley , is placed in charge of the attempt  
the script begins to go off the deep end at this point , when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shape-shift into any of several ugly alien life forms  
the first half of the film has something to offer , as "" sil , "" the alien girl , struggles with her multi-form existence , changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again , all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos  
she seems oddly knowledgeable about human society , with glaring gaps where her social skills should be  
her instincts are to mate and procreate , and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area  
escaping from her birth laboratory in utah , sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her  
she goes on an eating binge , spins herself a cocoon , and emerges as an adult , played by natasha henstridge , who goes a long way toward re-creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960  
the pursuers : michael madsen is an assassin/exterminator ; forrest whitaker is a convenient empath/psychic , just as though the u  s  government actually had such people on call  
neither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided  
whitaker's role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek : the next generation's "" counselor cleavage  "" 
the other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina  
kingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals , too good to not work to the best of their abilities ; but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland , and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak  
h  r  giger's design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it , although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly  
the main fault of species is lack of originality ; it starts out with a wonderful , albeit borrowed , premise , and then doesn't live up to it  
all we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes , with a few monsters tossed in  
there is no buildup of tension and suspense , no climax worthy of the name ; species is just a sequence of "" scare "" scenes stuck together  
the movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes , but not rescued by them  
on the other hand , as an exercise in sci-fi action/ adventure , it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd  
species earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board , but by and large , it's fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing "

1,"for example , in happy gilmore , sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self-confident jerk of a pro  
if the star were any other comic , that would be enough motivation to drive the movie , but with sandler , the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house  
that extra motive doesn't make happy gilmore a funnier movie  
it doesn't really add any genuine emotional depth , either  
in fact , the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie  
but sandler's philosophy seems to be , if it's a token gesture , why not make it a nice gesture ? 
that is endlessly refreshing  
in the wedding singer , sandler is right on track  
the fact that he's a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story  
what kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important  
david spade could have filled the role with cynicism and sarcasm  
he could make fun of the fat , ugly , or embarrassing people he meets at weddings , and the story would be intact  
but sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character  
he seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family  
robbie hart ( sandler ) doesn't just sing at weddings ; he also gets the loners to join in and have fun , and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing  
he is exactly the man you would want at your wedding  
the day comes when robbie has his own wedding , and he is stood up by his heavy-metal bride ( the movie is set in 1985 )  
robbie takes it hard  
he doesn't sleep , he doesn't eat , and he gets punched out at work when he sings "" love stinks "" at a wedding  
julia ( drew barrymore ) , who waitresses all the weddings in town , gives him a shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to  
eventually , robbie starts rebounding toward julia  
he really likes her , but she's engaged  
her fianc ? is a self-confident jerk ( do i see a trend - nope , just a formula ) who doesn't deserve her , but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand  
julia seems to like robbie too , but she can't leave her seemingly safe and stable fianc ? for the off-chance that robbie might be serious about her  
you know the story  
you've seen it a million times before  
there's always a new way to tell it , with new lovers , new chemistry , and new details , but it's the same story  
and sometimes , it works  
the wedding singer works  
first of all , the chemistry between sandler and barrymore is effective  
actually , it's not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each one's own romantic tension  
sandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man , struck with an unattainable love  
barrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with  
sparks don't fly when they kiss , but they both seem right for each other  
second , their love is mature  
they are not driven by passionate sexual attraction - they're a cute couple , but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material  
instead , they are both looking for someone meaningful , someone to settle down with , someone to grow old with  
at a wedding , robbie comforts a kid throwing up in a dumpster while julia sits by  
the repulsing situation is taken in stride , as if the two were already parents , caring for their sick child

1,"truman ( "" true-man "" ) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey's character in this film  
president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide , in spite of ( or was it because of ) his stature  
 "" truman "" also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war , an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans  
and burbank , california , brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc  
if hollywood is the center of the film world , burbank is , or was , the center of tv's world , the world where our protagonist lives  
combine all these names and concepts into "" truman burbank , "" and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world  
truman leads the perfect life  
his town , his car , and his wife are picture perfect  
his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky  
the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart  
  
  
but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light ? 
the next day during the drive to work , the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements  
he is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian  
when the radio comes back to normal , the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully  
his suspicion aroused , he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities  
the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator  
the elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks  
a grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door , made to look like the back of an elevator , into place  
two security guards grab him and throw him out  
truman is really suspicious now  
it gets even worse the next day when his wife , a nurse , describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge  
 "" it's best not to think about it , "" she says , trying vainly to change truman's memory  
truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense  
at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town  
his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world  
you know by now that truman's life is the subject of a television program  
his actions are "" real "" but everything else is carefully scripted , from the death of his father to the choice of his wife  
truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is  
meanwhile , christof , the all-seeing creator of truman's world does his best to keep him unaware and happy  
it's sort of like westworld told from the robots' point of view , or jurassic park from the dinosaurs' point of view  
we root for the captive of the cage-world  
our protagonist is counting on "" chaos theory "" to help him escape his elaborate trap  
the story , written by andrew niccol ( writer/director of gattaca ) , introduces some interesting questions , such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life , or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake  
although these questions came to mind , i don't think the film itself asked them  
it certainly didn't address them or try to answer them  
i was particularly disappointed that the film didn't deal more with the trauma of learning one's life is a tv show  
carrey's performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman's pain , but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film's pacing  
earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well "
1,"it is with hesitance that i call "" apocalypse now "" a masterpiece  
certainly , it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made , with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease , and some of the finest actors of the 1970's  
the plot , an adaptation of joseph conrad's "" heart of darkness "" , was set in vietnam , and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant , coming on the heels of the end of the war  
 "" apocalypse "" certainly has its moments , some of which are the finest in film history  
the plot is fairly simple  
captain willard ( sheen ) , is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty  
his mission is simple : take a boat up to cambodian territory , and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz ( brando ) "" with extreme prejudice ""  
along the way , willard runs into a series of adventures , including one with lt  col  kilgore ( duvall ) , and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies  
willard' s four person crew finally make it to kurtz' compound , where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives  
willard's experiences with kurtz take up the last half-hour , with a confrontation and eventual ending  
the movie is visually breathtaking  
the battle scenes are exquisitely done , and the score is brilliant , setting a murky mood of darkness that is first-rate  
the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening  
the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning , and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie  
the journey to kurtz' camp is quite a ride , with psychosis setting in on almost every character  
the most interesting one is kilgore , the lt  col  who cares more about the surf than about the mission  
it is at times revolting , psychotic , and incredible , and it is one hell of a movie  
the scenes are bold , inventive , and powerful , and the acting is stunning , especially be sheen , duvall , and fishburne  
the narration is exquisite , as is the mystery of kurtz  
coppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam , kind of like "" saving private ryan "" on lsd  
the film is jarring in its implications , and psychotic in its execution  
the problems come when the film slows down  
one of the major scenes in the film , where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz , is a colossal mess  
the dialogue is confusing , the lighting is atrocious , and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film  
the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound  
the film slows down to a drag  
sheen seems forever captured by a madman , played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received  
brando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes , but is bathed in shadows the entire time , making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic  
the scenes are poorly done , the dialogue is muffled , and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief  
sheen seems to adore this man , but why the viewers are never told  
the entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god-like kurtz , but the scenes fall way short of expectations  
granted , it has its moments , which are brutally horrific , but the general feeling is one of confusion  
brando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir , and my feeling was that this could never be a great man , this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him , so why do they do it ? 
there are moments of brilliance , but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene  
there are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending  
the finest scene at the end is sheen's escape , and his entrace into the temple "

1,"slavery is bad  
after hundreds of years , we've finally figured that one out  
this almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg's latest "" serious "" film  
during the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa's west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery  
fifty-three of them are stuffed into the "" la amistad "" ( from a spanish word for "" friendship "" ) by their new spanish owners  
freeing himself from his chains , senge pieh ( djimon hounsou ) , renamed cinque by his masters , leads a bloody revolt  
after killing most of the crew , the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home - or so they think  
instead the ship heads up the coast to the united states  
the amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy  
the legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property  
if they are property , who do they belong to ? 
their masters ? 
the spanish government ? 
salvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ? 
the us government ? 
the defendants are pawns in several games  
abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause  
their lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees  
south carolina senator john c  calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states  
president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends  
when the verdict looks to free the africans , van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes  
even that doesn't work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims  
at the urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave-owners  
this little-known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america's past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court  
the slavery issue is easy pickin's for spielberg  
much like his "" shindler's list "" ( which followed "" jurassic park "" as this follows "" lost world "" ) , the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose  
nazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human  
it's not hard to see who the bad guys are  
without that question to ponder , the director's job is more difficult  
he has to make the story interesting  
spielberg succeeds for the most part  
the visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach  
where the movie falls down is a bit more subtle  
there are very few _people_ in the tale  
in fact , cinque is the only character who is fleshed out  
tappan and joadson are "" abolitionists "" : symbols but not humans  
van buren is a weak politician but nothing else  
the rest of the "" slaves "" barely exist other than dressing for the set  
like many other films about people of color , almost all the major players are white  
the film's salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou  
the former model's first major role is a winner  
without speaking more than five words of english , he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog  
the other stand-out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents ( he also played the title role in "" nixon "" ) "

1,"the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do  
lives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice  
the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower  
most of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants  
it takes a pretty smart person to do that  
but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? 
what if he's also able to think on his feet ? 
in fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? 
it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f  gary gray's the negotiator  
in this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l  jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force  
when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder  
faced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office  
i don't quite remember if the captain actually said , "" i hate to do this , but    "" , 
although it wouldn't surprise me if he did  
luckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above  
after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j  t  
walsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed  
although roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue  
jackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman  
the actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats  
the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence  
how can we believe he's going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? 
unfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson's acting ability  
almost every time he's in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back  
when spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course  
his is an interesting character  
made out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation  
 "" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , "" he says  
when he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be  
soon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail  
this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor  
as the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely  
gray really lucked out with this cast  
david morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey  
the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d  a

1,"tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently  
the dalai lama has made speaking tours , tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops , the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months  
 "" kundun "" ( "" presence "" , a name the monks call the young dalai lama ) opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader  
a group of monks enters a village and a two-year-old child catches their attention  
the young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as "" mine ""  
he and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country  
he is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in 1950  
the peaceful and isolated country is ill-equipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results  
eventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india  
comparisons to "" seven years in tibet "" are inevitable  
both films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerner's point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt  
 "" kundun "" features only native actors and is more of an insider's story  
in some ways , this makes this film a superior concept , but it lacks the movement and spark that made "" seven years "" such an audience-pleaser  
the actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie ( filmed in morocco for obvious reasons )  
the only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computer-generated character  
on an intellectual level , it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts  
some events are depicted differently and pitt's austrian mountain-climber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lama's life isn't even mentioned here  
glossed over in "" seven years "" , the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses "" we were just about to change things "" after the chinese attack  
the film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins  
his lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail  
especially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain  
the visual treats more than make up for the movie's faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience  
walking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience  
martin scorsese , known for his dark tales of the underworld ( "" goodfellas "" , "" taxi driver "" , "" casino "" ) has shifted gears  
something of a thematic follow-up to his "" the last temptation of christ "" , this is his slowest film yet  
oddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese , most of these events take place off-screen  
his decision to not over-explain rituals is commendable  
the stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoon-fed interpretations  
philip glass's score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting  
i talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again  
hearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india , i was struck by what was missing in the movie  
as grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is , there is a distance between the audience and the movie  
the film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings  
with the exception of a few scenes , involvement with the characters is slight  
one of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama , shown as a mischievous boy who can't resist being a kid sometimes  
an encounter with his older brother thubten j  norbu ( a retired indiana university professor ) who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment , but there aren't many of these  
even with its problems , the "" kundun "" experience is phenomenal , but one that i fear most will miss  
many people who saw "" seven years in tibet "" will have a "" been there , done that "" attitude "

1,"film adaptation of hunter s  thompson's infamous semi-autobiographical hallucinogen-fueled book of the same title  
director terry gilliam of twelve monkeys ( 8/10 ) and brazil ( 7/10 ) fame , took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox ( sid and nancy ( 7  5/10 ) ) 
 "" apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie "" , according to gilliam  
plot : writer thompson ( depp ) heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr  gonzo ( del toro ) to cover a motorcycle race  
during their trip , they systematically consume "" two bags of grass , seventy-five pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high powered blotter acid , a salt shaker half-full of cocaine , a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers , a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of beer , a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls  
the movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use  
critique : i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewer's own mind , whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess  
if you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film , i would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels  
if , on the other hand , you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system , i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of this drug-induced picture's entire ride ( 5  5/10 for all those sober dogs )  
note : i have not read thompson's book  
having said that , joblo did engage in an alcohol-based consumatory session before ( and during ) the viewing of this film , so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level  
this movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour , rather than substance or plot  
it moves admirably from one scene to the next , without much basis of their being , while presenting us with the two days in the life of writer hunter s  thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs and alcohol than anyone could ever imagine  
it was 1971 , and the times were apparently "" a' changing "" in the states  
johnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop  
during the filming , depp apparently become fast friends with real-life writer thompson , and was known to wander off the set from time to time , for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole  
i thought he did seem to exaggerate his walk a little bit too much , but then again , this movie is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything and anything , so who am i to talk  
the one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr  gonzo  
i couldn't believe that this fat , samoan lawyer , was the same guy who played the slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects ( 7  5/10 )  
word on the street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role , and i must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible  
plenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin , christina ricci , tobey maguire and cameron diaz , along with a bunch of others  
other than that , the soundtrack was expectedly eclectic , the style was not as wild as i thought it would be , and the ending was certainly not much of a barn-burner , but then again , who really noticed  
this movie is about visions of bats floating through your head , johnny depp looking goofy and being bald , and the cornucopia of drug-ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy , rebellion and the lost american dream  
and for all those who plan on seeing this movie without the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie , i suggest you move further down the aisle , buy yourself a ticket to godzilla ( 6/10 ) , and enjoy the visual fabrications manufactured for the unstimulated mind  
little known facts : depp and del toro snorted plenty of powdered milk instead of cocaine  
bill murray also portrayed a thompson-based character in the film where the buffalo roam  
johnny depp turned down roles in the three musketeers , speed ( 7  5/10 ) , and legends of the fall ( 7  5/10 ) , for smaller and quirkier roles in benny and joon ( 6  5/10 ) and what's eating gilbert grape ? 
 ( 7/10 )  
in 1988 , depp told rolling stone magazine that he'd tried every drug by the age of 14  
johnny hung out with some of the members of oasis while filming the uncompleted divine rapture in ireland , and later played some slide guitar on the 1997 album , be here now  
johnny was born in kentucky , is a high-school dropout , has nicknamed himself "" mr "

1,"the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes , and the greedy trade federation has used it's armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo  
we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo's ruler , the young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) to sign a treaty giving the federation control  
however , the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade  
no sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi , and the first battle begins  
it seems that for me and thousands of people like me , the love for george lucas's trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time  
we're the fans , not the freaks  
we won't go dressing up like darth vader ( although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool ) , and we won't incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations ( not all the time , anyway ) , but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest , we're throwing down  
all right , stop looking at me like that  
we have been faithfully and patiently waiting  
waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll  
you see , the trilogy is not just a set of movies , but a religion of sorts to we , the faithful disciples , and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah  
unfortunately , it is not our savior  
for weeks beforehand , i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good - stupendously good - miraculously good  
anything less and it'll be the biggest disappointment of the century  
i didn't want the doomsaying prophecy to come true , really i didn't , but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking  
character development is virtually nonexistent  
with the possible exception of qui-gon , most of the film's characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions  
none seem very affected by their experiences , and few even show any passion at all  
contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks , a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo , in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala  
jar jar's life is saved by qui-gon early in the film , and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh ( or supposedly so )  
his speech mannerisms are so "" cute-ified "" that i couldn't understand a third of what he was saying , and the slapstick he performed was just distracting  
his head gets caught in an electronic field , his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast , he describes being in trouble as "" deep doo doo , "" and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport  
therein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors  
in star wars , we had obi-wan telling us mos eisley was a "" wretched hive of scum and villainy  "" 
in the phantom menace , we get doo doo  
the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story "" a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away     "" 
this film , on the other hand , constantly reminds me that it's only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience  
perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition ( it's kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses ) , and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500-like play by play  
i liked the pod race ; it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension , but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters ? 
the race would have been even more exciting without the distraction  
this aspect , coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me  
i suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer , but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all ? 
didn't millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again ? 
didn't the action figures still sell like hotcakes ? 
of course they did , and it's only poor judgment that allows the most-eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults  
one aspect that will appeal broadly , however , is the use of special effects  
the people at lucas's industrial light and magic , the world's premiere effects house , outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer-generated images and real-life footage  
some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed , especially the shots of a land battle between the federation's robot army and jar jar's countrymen  
the space battles are also impressive , although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer  
this , however , is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today "

1,"vannesa kensington : `austin , do you smoke after sex ? ' austin powers : `i don't know baby , i've never looked ! ' 
and so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer season  
austin powers 2 , the sequel to the sleeper hit of 1997 , is filled to the brim with uproarious sight gags and lurid toilet jokes that will make you keel over with hilarity  
the mind of mike myers is obviously a very bizarre place  
myers returns as the swinging 60's spy and his arch-nemesis , the bald headed dr  evil , who is given much of the spotlight here  
there's an early scene in which dr  evil and his son scott ( seth green ) appear on a jerry springer segment entitled `my dad is evil and wants to take over the world' , hosted by springer himself  
most of these talk-show gags , spoofing everything from oprah to regis and kathie lee , are no longer as funny as they once were  
happily , this is an exception , especially when a fight breaks out between dr  evil and the other guests  
 ( sample dialogue- `come back here you mother #@%$^ ! ! 
you want a piece of me ? ' ) 
the audience was in stitches  
there are many good things about this sequel  
dr  evil is now assisted by mini-me ( verne troyer ) , a pint-sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry  
mini-me is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for , and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does , pinkie and all  
mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina , evil's loud-mouth assassin sidekick , and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber  
this works surprisingly well  
afterward , there's even a meeting at the coffee machine , where their awkwardness is expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment  
oh , yes    
the plot  
after a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington ( elizabeth hurley ) that goes disastrously wrong , powers is back on the case to thwart the diabolical plans of dr  evil  
in the original , the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods  
here , it's time travel  
dr  evil has this crazy plan to steal austin's mojo ( the source of his sexual powers ) , so he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when powers is still is his freezing chamber  
there , he employs a grotesque 600-pound scottish assassin named fat bastard ( also myers ) to commandeer the mojo , so that our future hero is left completely shagless  
meanwhile , austin is informed of evil's wrong-doing by basil exposition ( michael york ) , and is supplied with his very own time-traveling device in the form of a volkswagen beetle  
once back in 1969 , powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell ( heather graham ) , and learns of dr  evil's plans to destroy washington dc with a lazer on the moon  
in one of the many uproarious jabs at star wars , evil calls the moon base a `death star'  
if there ever was a movie that knew from the start it was a complete joke , it's austin powers : the spy who shagged me  
ap2 has many hilarious moments , much more so , than the original austin powers  
but what it doesn't have is the confident support system that the first boasted , and the jokes are now more scattershot and hit-and-miss  
while myers has a knack for delivering clever , inspired gags , he sometimes doesn't know when to call it quits  
the hilarious scene in the original involving mustafa ( will ferrell ) and his refusal to die is played out here in a disappointing and tired manner

1,"denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances  
this perhaps may be washington's very best to date  
he joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent , this season , to become his character , copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly  
his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting "" the hurricane "" a much better film than it actually is  
when his rubin "" hurricane "" carter feels pain and is tormented by racism , he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy , disgust , and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices  
the horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago  
the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone , as his tortured carter , sum up the troubles of racism in america's history  
he is that amazing  
the problem with "" the hurricane "" is that when compared to washington , all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles  
mainly because the script focuses so much on carter , that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors  
this is , without a doubt , washington's movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying , it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars  
denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance  
as rubin carter , we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system  
>from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit  
then after a successful marriage and boxing career , he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder  
carter's second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous , powerful white men who refused to let him succeed  
from these past experiences in jail , carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america  
after several court appeals , an autobiography , and many public marches for his freedom , carter remained locked in prison  
it was not until a young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carter's book in the 1980's , that a serious battle for freedom took place  
the young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released  
the greatest scenes in the film are when carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation  
washington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again , he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career  
the devastation in washington's eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it  
in the hole , carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he cannot  
his anger is heightened to a point of no control  
we see multiple carters , a violent angry one , a silent passive one , and a mediator  
we see an emotional boxing match inside carter's head  
from this point in the hole to the end of the film , this fight continues  
it is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite  
when carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison , the angry carter at first erupts  
white people have been trying to hurt him his whole life , this reminder leads to anger in his head  
however , as the film continues and the canadians continue to help carter we see the calm side him  
he realizes that society is changing  
that racism is decreasing and now carter wants to leave jail immediately and become a part of this world  
very rarely have i seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here  
if only the other actors had this same determination  
dan hedaya , ridiculously plays the man who sends carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around  
it felt like his character was taken straight out of a "" scooby doo "" episode ; he would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for those annoying little kids  
 "" the kids "" in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable "

1,"no humans were harmed , tested or tasted in the making of this film  
all recipes are fictions  
twentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism  
a psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul ! 
director/writer antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts , but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves   
 ""   they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive   "" 
this true story , briefly mentioned in "" the shining "" , has no turned into a 143 minutes long motion picture  
in 1847 , the united states was a land of pioneers , of gold-starved americans making their way west  
it was a period of manifest destiny , the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries , stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could  
capt  john boyd ( guy pearce ) has become both a "" hero "" and a victim during this period of relentless consumption    
in ways he could never have imagined  
boyd's journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific mexican-american war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost , a waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california  
upon his arrival he is greeted by a small , motley group of soldiers , including his commanding officer , hart ( jeffrey jones ) , a previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life ; toffler ( jeremy davies ) , the fort's personal emissary to the lord ; knox ( stephen spinella ) , the veterinarian that plays doctor , who never met a bottle of whiskey he didn't like ; reich ( neal mcdonough ) , the no-nonsense soldier of the group ; and the seriously "" over-medicated "" cleaves ( david arquette ) , a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions  
into this cold , bleak and bizarre world staggers a stranger , colqhoun ( robert carlyle ) , a half-starved scot who had been traveling with a group of settlers until they became snowbound  
seeking refuge in a cave , they soon ran out of food - and were forced to consume one another  
colqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors d'oeuvre himself  
our heroes then decide to journey through the mountains to find the survivors , and colqhoun tags along to help out  
soon it becomes clear that colqhoun's tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will to survive  
it involves an old indian myth called weendigo , which states that a man who eats the flesh of another steals that person's strength , spirit and very essence  
his hunger becomes an insatiable craving : the more he eats , the more he wants , and the stronger he becomes  
there can never be enough , and death is the only escape   
it's all fairly sickening and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the whole movie through  
as professionally made as the movie is , you have to wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this  
teen-age horror fans won't care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell  
older folks might show up when they hear that the movie is actually a satire about the pioneer spirit , but they'll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces  
but jokes aside , this is a film that is well worth watching  
it has wonderful and mature characters , that few horror film s can boast of and a strangely effective story that continues to electrify you till the end  
the two main characters are also the most interesting  
boyd is a simple , honest man tiered of war , killing and fear  
his sacred wish is to live a normal , quite life away from gunpowder and blood  
colqhoun is different  
he proves that a man , on the brink of death , would do anything to stay alive , including sacrificing his own soul "
1,"you've got to love disney  
no matter what they serve up , it is a guaranteed success as long as it's animated  
kids have to go see the movie  
then they have to get the toys  
oh , the video came out ? 
got to buy it , or risk little billy's temper tantrums for the next month  
all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca : a visit to the magic kingdom  
stay at the disneyland hotel ! 
buy a disney t-shirt ! 
eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick ! 
it's both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it  
dale carnegie should have had it so good  
what's most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality  
you see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot  
the theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not  
the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same  
however , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box-office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer  
luckily , disney's latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula  
the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan-yu ( miguel ferrer )  
soon , china's emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china's defense  
when the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household  
fearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming-na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army  
mulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling  
mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman's role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that "" grace "" is not one of her strong points  
very early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one's family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task  
by leaving home to fight in her father's place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too  
as is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film  
i'm not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time  
both lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan's army unit and obligatory love interest , are more than competent , although salonga's voice translates much better to animation  
you have to hear it to understand  
interestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan  
there is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie  
it is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney's own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing  
artistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically "" disneyfied "" ethnic tale  
there are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan-yu's hun army , which utilizes the same computer-enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast  
the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it  
when mulan resolves to take her father's place , she dons her father's old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword  
as she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal  
it just left me thinking , "" that was really cool  "" 
a wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon-tek oh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang's conscripted army  
even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan  
although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance

1,"after hearing reviews for woody allen's upteenth movie in history , "" celebrity , "" range from terribly boring to just so-so , my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of "" manhattan , "" my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time  
woody allen's films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair , so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand-in-hand ( "" manhattan "" really is one of the best-looking films i've ever seen , beautiful black and white photography of the city's best areas , etc  ) , a fan can't help but feel visibly moved  
the film opens up , with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds , and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack , but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky , with the word "" help "" being spelled with an airplane  
beethoven's 5th blasts on the soundtrack  
the city seems to stop to take notice of this moment , and it's all rather lovely to look at  
and then we cut to a film crew , shooting this as the film's hilariously banal key moment in the film , where the lead actress in the film ( melanie griffith , looking as buxom and beautiful as ever ) has to realize something's wrong with her life or whatever  
it's a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film , with the great opening shots or without , and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again , a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works ( though , for the record , last year's "" deconstructing harry "" came awfully close )  
what the hell has happened to him ? 
the man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny , but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas  
 "" bullets over broadway , "" though wonderful , relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off  
 "" mighty aphrodite "" is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story  
 "" everyone says i love you "" was more of a great idea than a great film  
even "" deconstructing harry "" is admittingly cheap in a way , even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films  
if anything , the reception of "" celebrity "" by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time , it's not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is : it's him  
 "" celebrity "" is , yes , a good film , but it's only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film  
instead of creating the great woody allen world , he's created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about  
and he's fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities , so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections  
it's like "" la dolce vita "" without the accuracy , the right amount of wit , and the correct personal crisis  
woody , becoming more insecure in his old age , choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities , and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny , and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead  
much has been said about his performance - dead on but irritating , makes one yearn for the real thing , blah blah blah - but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh's performance , though featuring some of the same mannerisms ( stuttering , whining , lots o' hand gestures ) , is hardly a warts-and-all impersonation  
branagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm , which actually allows for his character's flaws to be more apparent  
woody's a flawed guy , and we know it , but we love him anyway , because he's really funny and really witty and really intelligent  
branagh's allen is a bit more flat-out bad , but with the same charm so that , yes , we like him , but we're still not sure if he's really a good person or not  
his character , lee simon , is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie , hits on extra actress winona ryder , then goes off to interview griffith , who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her , and she denies him    sorta  
we then learn , through flashbacks , that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid-life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion  
he has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts , covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate , so that he can meet them , and maybe sell his script ( a bank robbery movie "" but with a deep personal crisis "" )  
as such , he has divorced his wife of several years ( allen regular judy davis ) , and continues on a quest for sexual happiness , boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film  
after griffith comes his escapades with a model ( charlize theron ) who is "" polymorphously perverse "" ( glad to see allen is using new jokes , ha ha ) , who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of "" la dolce vita  "" 
following are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen , a relationship that almost assures him success , and his continued escapades with ryder , whom he fancies most of all  
his story is juxtaposed with that of davis , who flips out , but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome , friendly tv exec ( joe mantegna ) who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status  
while lee is fumbling about , selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness , davis becomes happy ( "" i've become the kind of woman i've always hated    and 
i'm loving it  "" ) 
without doing a thing  
the result is a film of highs and mediums "

1," "" the blair witch project "" was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses  
its success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted  
after the release of "" the blair witch project "" , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch  
locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig-sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie , and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , "" get out of these woods and go home ! 
there is no goddamned blair witch ! ""  
jeff ( ) is one of those people , who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage  
after he got released from the mental institution , he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet  
as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the "" blair witch hunt ""  
among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend , the pregnant tristen , who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called "" the blair witch : history or hysteria ? "" , and kim , who dresses in black and has some psychic powers  
the last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch-wannabe , who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying "" the first rule of wicca is , do no harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold  "" 
this strange group plunges into the woods , where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience  
on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr's abandoned house , strange things start happening  
when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain  
after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies  
they are somehow lost in time , as it loops uncontrollably back and forth  
they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality  
the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods   
documentary director joe berlinger ( "" paradice lost "" ) helms "" blair witch 2 "" , leaving the creators of the first film ( dan myrick and ed sanches ) in the background  
the opening scenes--the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film-- is a more promising approach , because instead of trying to cover similar ground , it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand  
but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story , that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue  
in a way , this is a typical hollywood sequel  
more money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail  
the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated  
of course in these situations , quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values  
from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest , with carter burwell's ( "" being john malkovich "" and "" fargo "" ) musical score in the background , you realize that with the exception of its title , this film has absolutely nothing to do with "" the blair witch project ""  
 "" blair witch   "" 
was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation  
in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection , creating a completely different atmosphere  
with its graceful cinematography , production design and flashy editing , the film has a very polished look , which is impossible to associate with the first installment  
and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times , he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor  
the key is simplicity  
 "" blair witch project "" had a story which was incredibly simple  
that allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination  
the film was practically an empty screen , on which we projected our most frightening nightmares  
the effect was incredibly powerful , lasting and entir e everyone , but in a different way  
 "" book of shadows "" feels incredibly controlled and restrict  
here , very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and "" clever "" that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it  
there is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with "
1,"call it touched by a demon  
gregory hoblit's fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist  
if marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven  
in fact , there's even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion's share of the weirdness distilled out  
 ( remember bob ? ) 
the biggest failing of fallen is that , although it's consistently interesting , it's not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope  
a serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice  
now , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , "" what goes around really goes around  "" 
shortly thereafter , he begins to sing "" time is on my side "" as he's taken on his last walk  
minutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead  
but for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn't a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel  
and , with reese's death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will  
only hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they're up against  
the rest of the cops , including hobbes' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don't have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger  
as depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one  
no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown  
the most famous landmark to appear isn't the liberty bell or independence hall ; it's geno's steaks  
shadows and night scenes abound  
the days are cloudy and unpromising  
this is the kind of setting where it's easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men  
fallen's plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized  
somehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise  
but the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check  
nevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks  
the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual  
of the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance  
john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick  
sadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel  
everyone else , including denzel washington , is boring  
washington's flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film  
it's not that he's bad per se , but he's not very interesting  
there's no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes  
as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was  
washington's subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency  
however , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler's list ) and donald sutherland  
to be fair , the flaws in their characters aren't all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written  
that said , however , there's nothing inspired about either davidtz's or sutherland's work  
both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual  
narratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses  
although the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters "

1,"until i saw the night of the hunter , it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie  
forget the others and the deep end ( which veered toward strained dramatics ) , the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie i've seen so far this year  
even though the movie is nearly 50 years old and there's a not drop of blood to be seen  
luckily , the night of the hunter , charles laughton's first and final directing gig , has been restored by the ucla film and television archive and is being re-released in october 2001  
so , there's still plenty of time to spill your popcorn all over the place  
robert mitchum stars as harry powell , a reverend with a nasty habit of courting and then killing widows for their cash  
his newest target is young mother willa harper ( shelley winters ) , whose murderer husband ben ( peter graves ) has hidden $10 , 000 somewhere  
powell finds out about the stash and decides to court mrs  harper after he's released and ben is hanged  
but finding the money isn't easy for powell , who must contend with his stepchildren ( billy chapin and sally jane bruce ) , who know where the money is , but aren't telling  
the hard part about seeing a classic now is the pop culture monster has usually drawn and quartered and then flaunted all the memorable moments , thus ruining the spontaneity and adventure when we finally watch it for the first time  
how many spoofs or salutes to the shower scene in psycho have we seen in other movies ? 
what about the brilliant baby stroller sequence from battleship potemkin ? 
 ( no , i'm not blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling problem  ) 
yes , there are some visual elements that other directors seem to have borrowed from the night of the hunter  
powell's "" love "" and "" hate "" knuckle tattoos obviously influenced spike lee in do the right thing ( remember radio raheem ? )  
and powell's black suit , with black tie and white shirt , could have shaped quentin tarantino's early visual style  
seeing the night of the hunter for the first time , i was amazed at how much it crackled with wicked wit and fright and how much intensity was intact  
you can now sign me up as president of the robert mitchum fan club  
he plays the role with a controlled malice that induces unease every time he appears  
he's like the senior class president with an evil streak  
if i ever need to stay awake , i'll just picture him crooning , "" leaning    
leaning     "" 
any actor who wants to play a character with a touch of evil should study his performance the way a rabbinical student studies the torah  
and credit must be handed out to laughton and cinematographer stanley cortez , who create a series of haunting , surreal shadowy images over the rural depression-era backdrop  
it's a testament to both men that they're able to invigorate what has become a hackneyed storyline ( kids harassed by evil guardians ) by sticking to the old maxim that we're more scared by what we don't see  
screenwriter and legendary film critic james agee does a beautiful job giving shape and substance to an array of supporting characters : the drunk birdie ( james gleason ) who's haunted by his wife , and the spoons ( evelyn varden and walt spoon ) whose marriage has become a verbal vaudeville act  
the only lapse is the movie's third act , when pearl and john run away from home and find a home with the motherly , bible-reading mrs  cooper ( lillian gish )  
her showdown with powell is memorable -- a battle done with dueling hymns  
however , the whole segment feels a little rushed and underdone , but it's still a thrill seeing the queen of the silent film era handling a shotgun  
do yourself favor and don't miss this if it comes to a nearby theater  
note : a series of revealing , but overlong , outtakes preceded the movie  
the highlights included the legendary laughton ( who sounds eerily like mr  pitt from seinfeld ) running winters' lines with mitchum , and the adorable , tiny bruce having trouble descending a coal pile  
hours more of such footage exists , as laughton liked to keep the cameras constantly rolling "

1,"andrew lloyd webber's musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time  
webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as "" oklahoma ! , "" or the slapstickness of shows like "" a funny thing happened on the way to the forum  "" 
they instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics  
like "" jesus christ superstar , "" which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune "" superstar , "" a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn't spread his message wider ) , "" evita "" takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things )  
 "" evita "" deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn't like di slept to "" the top "" )  
webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it  
here , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad  
it's also a musical , with almost no words not unsung  
the film plays like a rock opera , much like their "" jesus christ superstar , "" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one  
after all , this is a musical , and webber's musicals never undermine this  
they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side  
this is why the beginning of "" evita "" is kind of a let-down  
okay , it is a let-down  
i'm not saying the opening moments are bad , because they're pretty good  
but what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand  
in the musical , it's a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , "" buenos aires , "" which is also lifeless  
then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , "" another suitcase in another hall , "" which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva  
the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it's being narrated by a hater of eva's , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light  
for a while , it looks like alan parker can't pull it off  
however , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song "" goodbye and thank you , "" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful  
from this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical  
no more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact  
we see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer )  
more importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work  
juan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory  
a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before  
>from the "" goodbye and thank you "" number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation's people downtrodden  
but despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star  
that's when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she wasn't the great woman she really was , and expose her fame  
describing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he's said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can't help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death  
alan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he's done "" fame , "" "" the committments , "" "" bugsy malone , "" and "" pink floyd the wall "" - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is  
we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented  
his direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is  
and there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings "" don't cry for me , argentina , "" and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is  
madonna's golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film  
at the beginning , she looks like she's too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s )  
her death , though , is brilliant  
her singing could be better though  
i know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she's trying to hard "

1,"one of the sweetest tales to ever be made , it's a wonderful life isn't perfect , but its good natured charm and beautiful performances light up the screen with glorious results  
probably the greatest "" feel-good "" film of all time , it's a wonderful life aims for the heart , and strikes with a golden arrow  
on christmas eve , george bailey ( stewart ) is being prayed for by many in the small town of bedford falls  
you see , george is in trouble , and he has always helped others who needed it  
this one time , however , god answers his prayers , and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence ( travers ) to try and save george  
clarence has got his own problems , however  
clarence is an angel without his wings , and each time the bell rings , the wings pass him by  
the bailey case is a way for him to earn those magical wings and become a true angel  
but before clarence can save george , he first has to go through a cliffs notes version of george bailey's life  
we see george sacrificing his hearing to save his brother's life , sacrificing his college education to save the family business , sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother , and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else  
when the bank his family owns is in trouble , george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure the bank isn't sold to the evil mr  potter ( barrymore ) , who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls  
one christmas , potter gets his chance  
uncle billy bailey ( mitchell ) loses $8 , 000 of the bank's money  
without the money , the bank must close down  
george is stuck in a tremendous bind , and contemplates suicide  
clarence , the faithful servant , is there just to pick him up , and to show him what bedford would be like without george  
this is all a lead-in to the very famous last scene , where george finally sees what true happiness is about  
it's a wonderful life does have its faults  
the movie is beginning to feel dated in the details , especially in the treatment of women and men  
the sex roles in the film are weirdly out of place in the 90's , like something out of a revisionist look  
all the men drink too much and slap their wives too much during some portions of the film  
there are , however , endearing moments in all of this  
capra puts in just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the 50's to make the movie remarkably enjoyable  
the story is hackneyed , and the ending feels , well , a little too sugarish  
there's this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything , especially the sequences where george is either in trouble , or helping somebody  
it's a little too nice for my liking , at times  
there is , however , enough humor , enough wit , and enough of jimmy stewart to get the movie through the middle part , which would be the most difficult  
but watching it's a wonderful life is never boring or difficult : it's always interesting , right until the finale , which , for all its sugar , makes delightful sense and is beautifully done  
capra does have his monumental cliches , but the actors relish them and overplay everything to perfection  
donna reed is perfect as the loving , obeidient wife , and lionel barrymore is gloriously grump as mr  potter  
everyone else is magnificent , including bert and ernie ( ward bond and frank faylen )  
there is a general sense of goodness , as if everyone in the film knows that they are making a great film , and they relish that  
stewart , however , is the king of all of this  
he is sometimes awkward , especially when saying "" merry christmas "" to all objects , animate or inanimate  
but he is james stewart , and he's lovably delightful throughout the film  
have i complained ? 
i shouldn't have  
this is a really good movie "
1,"assume nothing  
the phrase is perhaps one of the most used of the 1990's , as first impressions and rumors are hardly ever what they seem to be  
the phrase especially goes for oscar novak , an architect who is the main focus of three to tango , a delightful , funny romantic comedy about assumptions and being yourself  
novak ( matthew perry ) , a shy , clumsy , chicago based architect , along with openly gay partner , peter steinberg ( oliver platt ) , fights for projects day in and day out  
one of these is the job of restoring a popular building for charles newman ( dylan mcdermott ) , a rich , well-known businessman  
charles immediately takes a liking to oscar , as he enjoys his personality and sense of humor  
seeing oscar as someone he could trust , charles asks him to watch his girlfriend , an unpredictable , adventurous girl named amy post ( neve campbell ) , who makes a living by blowing glass  
charles wants to know who she talks to , what she does , and where she goes  
the point ? 
to make sure she's not seeing someone else , of course  
oscar gladly takes the job , and meets amy at an art show of hers , and sparks fly between the two from the get go  
oscar feels he has found the one meant for him , and he is content with the idea of being with amy  
well , another popular phrase of the 90's is "" all good things must come to an end , "" and this stays true for oscar as well  
charles walks in on amy and oscar having a drink one night , as oscar and amy have become great friends , but he doesn't seem to mind  
why is this ? 
he thinks oscar is gay  
he's not afraid to share this with him either  
oscar stands in shock after the words , "" i swear if you weren't gay oscar , i'd have to kill you , "" are muttered flamboyantly from charles' mouth  
the word spreads instantly through town  
will oscar "" come out "" of his supposed gayness , or will he tell everyone that he isn't ? 
one would immediately think he would deny the fact , but numerous occurrences come to oscar , which result in the fact that if he denies the fact , he could lose his job with charles  
matthew perry doesn't escape his character as chandler on the already classic t  v  
comedy "" friends , "" as both oscar novak and chandler are clueless , shy , and sensitive  
nonetheless , perry is hilarious here , and shows that he can handle drama , as obviously , his character suffers quite a bit here  
it's wonderful to see neve campbell outside of a horror movie , ( she was the star of scream 1 and 2 , and the upcoming scream 3 ) as she handles comedy superbly here  
her voice , smile , and personality are more than perfect for romantic comedies- stay with this genre , neve  
neve is delightful as her conflicted character , who feels love for oscar , but knows , based on rumors , that he is gay  
as usual , campbell is likable as her likable character  
unlike the other two leads here , dylan mcdermott is flat in his dialogue , and is never convincing  
when his character his present , mcdermott sets a dull tone to the scene with his horrible acting  
stick to the t  v  
drama , the practice , dylan  
the major weak spot in three to tango is the direction of damon santostefano  
no originality or technique is used whatsoever  
three to tango is lucky that the script is so edgy and that perry and campbell are wonderful in comedy , or else the film would have been a disaster , as it is just plain boring to look at  
three to tango is a film done many times before , as the plot is suspiciously close to 1998's the object of my affection , but the plot has never been completed so well  
three to tango's script , written by rodney patrick vaccaro and aline brosh mckenna is fun , fast , and funny , delivering not only original , hilarious gay jokes ( not your run of the mill material ) , but a certain snappiness in the dialogue between characters that always keeps you smiling  
unlike last summer's south park : bigger , longer , and uncut and 1997's in & out , three to tango is a comedy in which the gay element is not crude or vulgar  
the script is wise to take this route , as gays can't ( i don't think so , anyway ) be offended by this light , playful comedy  
 ( to prove this , a gay couple was in the audience who were laughing constantly "

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
the teaser trailers for my best friend's wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i'd frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often  
it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend's wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms  roberts  
the heroine of my best friend's wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn't married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other  
both julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael's age , julianne realizes that he's mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day  
however , she finds herself even more distraught when michael's call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary  
the setup for my best friend's wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film's storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p  j  hogan , whose first feature , muriel's wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend's wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour  
the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr  hogan  
for example , there's a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background  
my best friend's wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen's everyone says i love you ; i'd even assert it's a more successful one  
my best friend's wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well  
in a typical romantic-comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy's life , she'd actually like her too  
the george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend's wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality  
throughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic-comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion  
there is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we're given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments  
my best friend's wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top-notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne  
this isn't the sort of role one usually associates with ms  roberts - the julianne character's neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms  roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable  
even better than ms  roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend's weddding  
with a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy's insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film  
she even sings - i won't soon forget her charming serenade of "" i just don't know what to do with myself ""  
rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film  
his george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr  everett's performance is a delight to watch ; he's clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous  
dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he's not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms  roberts and mr  mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic  
when julia roberts' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as "" america's sweetheart "" by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile  
while that didn't quite work out , it's near-certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic-comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game  
my best friend's wedding marks a return to form for ms  roberts , and cements p  j "

1,"by now i figured i'd seen every alfred hitchcock film at least a half-dozen times -- not that i'm complaining  
to call him the "" master of suspense "" is an understatement  
the paradine case ( 1947 ) , admittedly one of hitchcock's lesser movies , turned out to be one i'd missed  
this one , like all hitchcock films , is well worth savoring  
the story opens with the rich mrs  maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her home for poisoning her blind husband  
as mrs  paradine , alida valli plays an aloof but alluring woman of the world  
to franz waxman's stark and moody music , we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments and jewels  
stripped of her fine raiment , she becomes a commoner again , which , as it turns out , was what she was before she met her husband  
 "" a brief skirmish , and you'll be lunching at the savoy again , "" anthony keane , her ultraconfident attorney tells her in their first meeting , predicting a fast and easy trial  
gregory peck plays the successful and debonair barrister  
 "" she's no murderess , "" he argues simplistically , smitten by her beauty  
 "" she's too fine a woman  "" 
his attitude upsets his beautiful and increasing jealous wife , gay ( ann todd )  
unlike most hitchcock movies , which are centered on the thriller and the mystery , this one is more a romantic melodrama  
typical is the scene in which gay flings her head back and shakes her hair while bathed in light  
she deflects her husband's affections as she fears that he is beginning to fall in love with his client  
the dramatic music then comes up high as the camera dwells on mrs  paradine's portrait nearby  
in the relatively unsatisfying first half , little happens other than domestic squabbles and overtones of intense adulterous desires  
to the sound of sweeping violins gay tells anthony that he must get mrs  paradine acquitted because , if mrs  paradine dies , his heart will go with her  
if she is freed , he will be able to forget her  
as part of the soap opera , a mysterious louis jordan plays mr  paradine's valet , who has had some not to be discussed relationships  
charles coburn plays anthony's legal partner , sir simon flaquer  
and charles laughton , who looks like coburn , is judge lord horfield  
this being proper british society , they will all dine together at the judge's house not long before the case begins  
court tv junkies will probably pick up the many differences , some subtle and others not , between the american and the british judicial systems  
one , for example , of which i was not aware is that the barrister cannot speak to his own client during the recess if she is the process of testifying  
one sometimes wonders what the academy is thinking when they make their oscar nominations  
as the judge's wife , lady sophie horfield , ethel barrymore got a nomination for best supporting actress -- the film's only nomination -- for an inconsequential part with which she did little of merit  
 ( so the big question is when does hitchcock make his obligatory walk-on ? 
at 37 minutes into the film , he leaves a train station carrying a large musical instrument case  
don't miss it  ) 
in the second half the story finally comes alive when it gets into the courtroom  
the great master shows his hand there as the tensions build as rapidly in the second part as they lay fallow in the first  
watch how the camera angles are sometimes from the back and other times from way on high to set the exact tone for the trial's action "
1,
1,"let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films  
i'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years  
i'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film  
by that point , it was evident that mr  bond was back with a vengeance  
all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience  
it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts  
it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in  
i guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain  
anyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond  
i think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films  
there were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined  
and bond's last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series  
the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series  
everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007  
for the most part , the action sequences worked very well  
although , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film  
i think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted  
while he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film  
most noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie  
he almost seemed like he didn't know what he was doing  
but they were brief scenes and really shouldn't take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing  
if you have ever seen a bond film , you won't be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit  
the world is not enough is no exception  
this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world  
007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain  
why this point is included is beyond me  
they took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought  
anyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid-east oil pipeline  
i guess world domination just isn't as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore  
bond is brought in to protect the pipeline's owner , elektra king ( sophie marceau ) , who is the daughter of one of renard's recent victims  
along the way , bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist , dr  christmas jones ( denise richards ) , and his old rival valentin zukovsky ( robert carlyle )  
like all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words  
my biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films  
there was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing  
the buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau's character  
it was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film  
later , it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something "

1,"in "" the sweet hereafter , "" writer/director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living  
he shows us how it isn't dying that hurts , but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death , and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings  
on a cold winter day in a small , isolated town in british columbia , a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake , where it cracks through the ice and sinks  
fourteen children die , and numerous others are hurt  
for the residents of this small town , all of whose children were on that bus , it is an earth-shattering event that resolutely alters their lives  
they have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain , but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle  
alberta and risa walker , who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident , hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ( ian holm ) to bring a lawsuit against someone , anyone for responsibility  
the bus driver , dolores driscoll ( gabrielle rose ) , is a kindly woman who loved the children and , although she lives with a burden of guilt , is not held responsible for the accident  
the bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice , and there was nothing should could do to prevent it  
however , according to stephens , there are no "" accidents "" in life , and someone will pay for this tragedy , whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through  
he goes through the town , approaching the parents who have lost children , asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger  
and , for his work , stephens will receive one-third of the settlement money  
however , it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money  
he is driven by something else , something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents  
he has lost a child , too , but not in the same manner  
his daughter , zoe ( caerthan banks ) , who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite , has been in and out of drug re-hab clinics and detox stations for ten years  
she calls him on an irregular basis , begging him for money , but refusing to tell him what she needs it for  
 "" i don't know who i'm taking to , "" he tells her  
in his mind , his daughter is dead  
the lawsuit is , to stephens , not only a way to mend the town's pain , but also his own  
however , not everyone in town wants it to happen  
billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children , wants nothing to do with it  
he has already lost his wife , and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman  
he doesn't want to talk about the accident , and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds  
to him , the town should be able to take care of its own pain , and it doesn't need outsiders like stephens getting in the way  
central to "" the sweet hereafter "" is the tale of nicole burnell ( sarah polley ) , a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into "" a wheelchair girl , "" as she puts it  
aside from stephens , nicole is the most complex character in the film , and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out  
it is also her sad , haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack , reading robert browning's poem about the pied piper , and how when he led all the town's children away , one was left behind because he was crippled  
obviously , nicole is that child , and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town's children left her alone by dying in the wreck  
her situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving , but incestuous relationship with her father ( tom mccamus )  
there is only one , fleeting scene that suggests this relationship , but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film  
of all the storylines in "" the sweet hereafter , "" this is the most complicated and unresolved , although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film  
egoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers -- if any at all -- and he doesn't condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up  
what egoyan has done in "" the sweet hereafter "" is really nothing short of miraculous  
in his adaptation of the novel by russell banks , he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss , and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life  
egoyan has always been a talented , but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold  
 "" the sweet hereafter "" is quite the opposite ; egoyan's stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion , and draw the audience into the tragedy  
 "" the sweet hereafter "" seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked  
the film is filled with beautiful , subtle performances from all the actors , especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind "
1,"one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made , "" se7en "" is just a few steps away from brilliance  
however , those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss  
the film received mixed reviews upon release , but there's an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice  
at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing , but the script and the ultimate pay-off are excellent  
the shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable  
this piece of work is 100% intensity  
it's uncomfortable to watch , yet compelling  
 "" i want not to look , yet i cannot turn away  "" 
the story creeps along slowly and deliberately , crafted by visionary director david fincher  
he has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions , but not giving away too much too soon  
this is the guy who directed the ominous "" alien 3 ""  
 "" se7en "" is even more ominous because the threat is real  
it's human and , while the script takes some artistic licence , the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic  
that is , if a human being could be so intelligent , patient , wealthy , and disillusioned  
after the most bizarre opening credits i've ever seen ( refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment ) , the initial character development takes place  
morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset , a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society  
brad pitt co-stars as detective david mills , the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys  
these two fine actors give the film its human qualities ( along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow , who plays tracy , mills' wife )  
however , none of them stands out above the material  
no disrespect intended , but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same  
an ironic note is that somerset has only a week ( or 7 , that's seven , days ) left on the force to train his young protege  
the title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins , as chronicled by john milton in "" paradise lost "" --gluttony , greed , sloth , lust , pride , envy , & wrath  
incidentally , i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found  
it's the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking , but i won't give that away  
as i said , this has a great ending and no one should spoil it  
anyway , the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the "" sinners "" suffer for it  
the two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man  
they learn that he was murdered--forced to eat himself to death  
the killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and , of course , somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way  
if they didn't , it would be one short movie ! 
the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story  
we see a lot of blood , but it's not especially violent  
the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown--like most of the violence in "" pulp fiction ""  
 "" se7en "" is gory , graphic , and disturbing , but all the gore is post-death  
still , if you tend to get queasy , don't eat food during this film  
kevin spacey plays john doe , the avenging angel who claims that he's the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings  
like many crazy men , he has some fine ideas , but some sick ways of expressing himself  
spacey doesn't appear until the final 30 minutes and also doesn't receive billing in the opening credits  
however , it's his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination  
a great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not "
1,"more than forty years ago , the "" sword and sandals "" genre of historical epic ruled the box office  
during the 1950's hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope  
 "" ben-hur  "" 
 "" cleopatra  "" 
 "" the robe  "" 
 "" sparticus  "" 
 "" the fall of the roman empire  "" 
 "" quo vadis  "" 
sometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood  
since then , epics have appeared infrequently ( "" the last emperor , "" "" braveheart "" ) and some of the best have been small-screen affairs produced in the 1970's ( "" roots , "" "" shogun "" )  
yet , the phrase "" we who are about to die salute you "" has been absent until now  
 "" gladiator "" begins in germania in a  d  180  
roman general maximus ( russell crowe ) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting  
however , the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) will prove a poor successor , so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again  
when commodus hears the plan , he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered  
maximus escapes from the executioners , but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son  
a caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa  
 ( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus' place is never explained  ) 
an african named juba ( djimon hounsou ) treats maximus' wounds  
proximo ( oliver reed ) , a gladiator who won his freedom , purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena  
of course , maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier , and his fame spreads  
when commodus reopens the coliseum , proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete  
our hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus' sister lucilla ( connie nielsen )  
the similarities to "" braveheart "" are obvious : an evil king , a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family , the aid of a lovestruck princess  
also , like mel gibson's epic , "" gladiator "" has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero's anger  
it's a simple tale of good versus evil  
maximus has all the manly virtues : nobility of purpose , courage in battle , loyalty to king and country , physical stamina , and devotion to family  
commodus is his opposite in every way : a sniveling , selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience  
the opening night crowd in my theater was about 70% male , and that seems appropriate  
 "" gladiator "" is a guy movie ( would the opposite of a "" chick flick "" be a "" dick flick "" ? )  
there's much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences  
 ( those easily offended by gore should stay away  ) 
lucilla is the only female character , and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife  
joaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance  
in the scene where commodus kills his father , phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father's love or pride  
throughout the picture , phoenix manages to give depth to a character who's scripted as a caricature of evil

1,"gordon fleming ( peter mullan ) is in a bind  
he has a new , unexpected baby and his business , hazardous material removal , is in danger of going under  
when he and his crew get a job opportunity at the long-abandoned danvers state hospital , he underbids the competition to secure the contract and promises to get the three-week job done in one  
it will prove to be a fateful week for them all in "" session 9  "" 
gordo gets the job to remove asbestos and other hazardous materials from the spooky old mental hospital in preparation for relocating town offices there  
their guided tour of the facility by a local official , bill giggs ( paul guilfoyle ) , brings them through some of the creepier parts of the former asylum  
but , a job is a job and , if they finish in a week , as promised , there is a $10000 bonus in store  
as they get down to their work , things , normal and not so normal , begin to happen  
gordon hears a disembodied voice beckoning him  
phil ( david caruso ) is conflicted working with a guy , hank ( josh lucas ) , who is seeing his old girlfriend  
mike ( co-screenwriter steven gevedon ) has discovered a cache of audiotapes and transcripts from old psychiatric sessions ( hence , the title ) with inmate mary hobbs , a multi-personality patient with a dark secret  
gordo's nephew , jeff ( brendan sexton iii ) , suffers from night phobia and is afraid to venture into the dark bowels of the hospital  
as the agreed upon week draws to an end , hank mysteriously disappears from the workplace after a nocturnal confrontation with someone ( something ? ) in the hospital  
tensions mount and distrust build among the rest as they watch their chance for the bonus start to slip away  
but , there is more , much more , at stake as the hospital and its history of insanity weigh on them all  
i don't want to give away too much of the story of "" session 9 , "" so i'll stop there  
what we have here is a spooky horror flick that uses none of the jump-out-at-you-from-the-dark cheap shots that have become part and parcel with horror films since the advent of "" halloween "" and "" friday the thirteenth  "" 
there is no cat leaping out of the dark or the shock of suddenly seeing oneself in a strategically placed mirror  
with the exception of one shadowy and chilling image at one point spooky interlude in the film , there is little that you can get your arms around as far as what , specifically , is "" frightening  "" 
as i watched "" session 9 "" i became aware of the subtle things that built up during the story that make it a true horror movie  
the striking high-definition video camera work by uta briesewitz ( who worked with the director , brad anderson , on his "" next stop wonderland "" ) helps to build up tension with close-ups , fluid camera movement and odd angles in a way that would make alfred hitchcock proud  
music , too , is used to intense effect , joining with the camera to make simple scenes frightening , even horrifying  
couple these tech feats with an intelligent story that uses elements of "" the shining , "" "" the blair witch project "" and , even "" the texas chainsaw massacre "" and you get a decent , intriguing horror flick  
additionally , the brilliant decision to shoot at danvers state hospital gives the film another starring character , the institution itself , which lends even more chills to the equation  
acting is another factor that raises "" session 9 "" above the usual dreck presented in recent horror hits like "" scream , "" "" i know what you did last summer "" and their sequels  
those films took good-looking , though generic , young actors and actresses and put them to use to build up a body count , substituting mayhem for real horror  
anderson opted , instead , to use mature , experienced actors like peter mullan and david caruso to fill his characters' shoes and the difference in casting quality is notable  
mullan , in particular , puts an arc on his character , gordon , as the troubled guy who slowly and inexorably falls under the pressures of family , job and , finally , danvers state hospital  
the rest of the small cast fit the bill as people , not just fodder for the mayhem  
david caruso , as gordo's senior man and near equal in the business , shows just how good an actor he is  
he made the jump from tv's "" nypd blue "" to film far too soon and his decisions in the roles he took ( i'll never forget the horrendous "" jade "" ) were less than star making  
he rolls his sleeves up and does the job well here  
gevedon , lucas and sexton are more than fodder , too  
the only problem with "" session 9 "" lay in the uninspired ending  
it takes on a fairly conventional finale that covers old ground and is a bit of a disappointment after the terrific ( and inspired ) build up  
the pleasure is getting there and i wish that anderson and gevedon had kept up the steam they had so ably built during the bulk of the film 
 "" session 9 "" is an unusual feat  
it is scary , doesn't use cheap tricks and raises goose bumps with its intelligently rendered , subtle horror  
because of the local interest of danvers , it should do well with the northeast crowd  
i hope it gets the national distribution it deserves "

1,"one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable  
you know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is  
sure , it's been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch  
this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun  
one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story  
this rule applies highly to kiss the girls  
there is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made  
however , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through  
well , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up  
unfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits  
that may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery  
however , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film  
plotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality  
we are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero  
he gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself  
obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene  
at his house , cross is told that his neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been missing for four days  
this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can't sympathize with detective cross  
however , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees    
before she is abducted  
dr  kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd family ) is a smart , athletic woman , and because of these traits , becomes a target for casanova--what the serial killer likes to call himself  
because of these character-developing scenes , we care for mctiernan , making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful  
after being abducted , mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods  
remembering that the killer gave her certain rules , she decides to break one of them by calling out  
when casanova comes to punish her , she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall  
after she is found , she begins to help cross find his neice  
from this moment on , kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film , as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive  
many people will compare this film to 1995's seven , another killer film starring morgan freeman , but i presume that the similarities are intentional  
the screenplay , by david klass , is adapted from the novel written by james patterson , and yet i don't quite see how this story could have worked in novel form  
what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness  
the cinematography , by aaron schneider , is reminiscient of seven , and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us  
sometimes a simple shot is the best one  
however , many of the shots are stunning , and unlike seven , most of them take place during the day , in sunlight  
the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done , in more than one way  
the camera work is terrific , but the editing makes this scene work so well  
the chaotic and mtv-type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness , exactly what judd's character is experiencing "
1,"usually when a blockbuster comes out , it's loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action  
mystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year  
the film is based upon the comic book series "" the flaming carrot "" by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear )  
things go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city  
well , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance  
this is where the film takes a turn for the better  
in the beggining , there were only 3 wanna be heroes  
 "" blue raja ( hank azaria ) , "" mr  furious ( ben stiller ) and "" the shoveller ( william h  macy )  
sure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast  
that is until they aquire "" invisible boy "" ( kel mitchell ) , and "" the bowler "" ( janeane garafalo ) and "" mr  splein "" ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess  
thankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen  
the whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest  
for one , the film is considerably clever  
it literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc  in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way  
a part of the cleverness comes from the cast  
sometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here  
while azaria and macy were enteratining , 2 characters really stood out  
one was paul reuben  
no matter how disgusting or revolting "" mr  splein "" may be , you still can't help but laugh  
it' so incredibly moronic , it's just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions  
janeane garafalo also was an interesting character  
she seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flowing  
men is worth seeing alone , for those 2 troubled heroes  
on the downside , a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off  
kel mitchell and geoffrey rush , were both utterly useless  
their parts were so limited , they'd be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes  
ben stiller too was wasted , mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue  
none of these characters get a rise out of anybody , but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film  
as far as the budget goes , it was wisely spent on the cast , not the effects  
while the set designs and action all look nice , i'm glad there was a seperate aspect , that the film focused on , and for that i applaud  
slow at times , and rather pointless , mystery men still delivers  
it forgets about money making , because it's not likely to make a bundle like it's proceeders , and that's what works  
stupid ? 
maybe , but for once i'm not disappointed  
no one expected an intelligent film , but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year "

1,"i'm not really sure what to think about "" crash  "" 
on the surface , it's a cold , boring , unerotic porn with name starts , a name director , and some cool camerawork  
i mean , it left me completely bored , unsatisfied , and generally kinda weirded out  
but then again , not every film's supposed to leave you entertained  
 "" crash "" is structured to play like a porn flick , but with significantly more plot and dialogue  
while we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex , we also have a skimpy little plot going on ( mostly towards the beginning ) , and maybe just a hair of characterization  
not to mention the acting is generally pretty good , and we don't really see a lot of the actors completely exposed  
but what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience  
this film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of "" henry and june "" or the just plain horniness of , say , "" deep throat "" ( not that i've seen it )  
if one was to be made completely hot by this film , it would probably mean they were also into the whole "" auto eroticism "" thing  
the film leaves you cold erotically ( and maybe in many other ways ) , but what it does is present a group of people who live on the edge  
the film opens up on a woman , catherine ( deborah kara ungar , of "" the game "" ) , pressing her bare breast up against a car in a public air hangar  
suddenly , a man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind ( the film doesnt' show all this though , even if it is nc-17 )  
the next scene has a film director , james ( james spader ) , having sex with a camera woman ( alice poon ) in an office on the highly-populated set of his movie  
the next scene has the two coming together , revealing to us that they're husband and wife , and them sharing in one another's escapades  
while the two are arguably freaky people , we at least know they love to live on the edge  
soon afterwards , james is driving down the road at night , reclessly of course ( he's reading something ) , when he drifts into the other lane , and then hits another car face on  
james is not killed , but the passenger in the other car flies into his seat ( obviously dying ) , leaving the driver , helen remington ( holly hunter - in a porn ? ) , also alive  
the two go through therapy together , and when getting out , they run into eachother again  
when james gives her a ride home , they almost get into another accident , and immeadiately afterwards , they go to an unbusy parking lot , and have a little quickie , as they were aroused by the accident  
you wouldn't think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish , but they run into a freaky guy named vaughan ( elias kosteas ) and his crutch-carrying girlfriend , gabrielle ( rosanna arquette ) , who are also into it  
vaughan is into living on the edge as they are , but he takes it to another level : he loves to recreate famous car crashes  
in one scene , he and a friend , colin seagrave ( peter macneill ) recreate james dean's car crash without any padding or safety belts , and suffer some concussions , but nevertheless get a rush ( and the attention of the police )  
soon , these five are all having sex with one another , be it straight , gay , or lesbian sex  
while this is admittingly all a bit comical ( the film is almost like a black comedy ) , the film does do a pretty awesome portrayal of people who's main fetish is living on the edge  
i'm sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents , but i personally don't see a connection between car crashes and sex  
the main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush  
his car crash scenes are quick and exciting mini-masterpieces : we're at first not sure if they'll take place , but everytime it looks like it may occur , we gasp  
then when it happens , we hold our breath  
the same thing happens with sex , although not in the same fashion  
these people are merely taking it to another level  
the only problem with the film is that it's a tad redundant  
a normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and a half  
this goes on for about 100 minutes , and it just seems a little too long  
the sex and car crashes are far between one another , and the time between them are a tad on the boring side  
there's no characterization , although it could definitely be argued , that hey , it's a porn , and we're not here to sympathize  
but still , they coulda cut it down a bit  
but the film is saved with its presentation , as well as some other elements  
the atmosphere is very dark and forboding , creating a kind of cool weird feeling "

1,"showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven , director , and joe eszterhas , writer  
their last effort , basic instinct , played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry-spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone's taste , but certainly a well-crafted movie  
possibly that movie's greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage , prior to the movie , during the movie , and after the movie    
and that , after bringing all the plotlines together neatly , it left the viewer with full knowledge of what * would * happen in the characters' future , so there was no need to film it  
there was actually about four hours' worth of screen story there , but eszterhas found ways to get it all on-screen in two , by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on ; and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails  
the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls  
we have attractive , sympathetic , but still highly repellent characters ; we have shows for the eyes and the ears , plotlines that play on several levels , we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable , and we have a story of an innocent ( who may not be so innocent ) who's trying to play straight , trying to improve her station in life , who slips into behaving the way those around her do    
but recovers with a flourish , and quits a winner  
in this sense , the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven , who's not known for treating his characters well ; but nomi , the part played by elizabeth berkley , definitely opts out of the game in a positive way , and we're left feeling good about her future  
this is not one of the great movies , but it's far better than we'd been led to expect by all the negative pre-release publicity  
verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 , and in the last quarter-century has pushed farther and farther , experimenting with the socially-acceptable limits to movie-making  
his most recent three movies , robocop , total recall , and basic instinct , have been a progression of back-door access to american culture , moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives ; and now he's exploring the sleeze  
this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director's contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie  
 ( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating , although his original version is available on video  ) 
many reviewers have taken the politically-correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing ; but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies , it's about people in an environment where naked ladies are common , and why such an environment should exist  
it's about the scum who use other people as power-trip toys , and the need to escape their power  
it's about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don't pertain ; and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment  
an nc-17 movie which isn't sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty , power , or value  
the one scene in the movie that * could * have been a good sex scene , berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool , is not exciting , because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator  
if anything , it's a rape scene with a victim who's been duped into cooperation  
you don't make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors ; you don't make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed ; and you don't make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls    
and in an awful lot of vegas shows , an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing  
this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry , in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity  
showgirls de-glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness  
nomi is played , in a very good performance , by elizabeth berkley , who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who's at the end of her rope , desperate to live a life better than the one she's known  
she has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability , and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker , trying to be something better than she seems destined to be  
when nomi realizes she's gone too far for too little , she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be  
gina rivera plays molly , a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi , providing her with what may be the one solid , positive relationship in nomi's entire life  
molly is the one who makes the difference , and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she'll be using for the rest of her life , and nomi's feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi's decision  
gina gershon plays cristal , an aging , but still very attractive starring dancer , a reflexively competitive manipulator who's become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her  
gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch ; a fading talent made bitter by self-awareness  
her character is very well drawn and performed ; in a major scene in a hospital room , she acknowledges what she is , and , in essence , passes the torch to nomi  
the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie , and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path "

1,"in 1977 , something never though possible happened  
the film star wars was released , with extraordinary , never seen before techniques of special effects  
the film set a new standard for special effects in film  
not only did it set a standard for the special effects , it set a standard for film itself  
the plot is one of the most creative i heard ever  
the legend of star wars starts long ago with the jedi  
the jedi were warriors who were wiped out by the dark side  
darth vader is the leader of the dark side  
ben obi-wan kenobi , played by sir alec guinness , was one of those jedi who is still alive today  
darth vader was once a jedi , until he turned to the dark side  
years after the killing of the jedi , darth vader is still around causing trouble  
r2-d2 and c-3p0 are both what we call "" driods "" , or robots that are of assistance to humans  
while an attack on the ship that princess leia , played by carrie fisher , is aboard , she inserts a message to r2-d2 , who is also on the ship  
to obi-wan kenobi pleading for help  
the princess is captured by vader , but r2-d2 and c-3p0 get away on an escape pod that eventually lands them on the remote planet of tatooine  
the jawas , or small creatures who sell droids , pick r2-d2 and c-3p0 up to sell  
they are bought by luke skywalker's ( mark hamill ) family  
while luke is cleaning the droids , the message from princess leia is found  
luke finds this obi-wan kenobi , and learns that obi-wan was a friend of luke's father , who is now dead  
luke also learns his family was a jedi  
after luke's family is killed by tropps from the dark side , ben decides to put luke through training to stop the dark side and destroy them once and for all  
ben wants to create a new jedi  
first , the two must find princess leia and serve her  
han solo , played by harrison ford , and his sidekick chewbacca , played by peter mayhew , are consulted about providing a ship to complete the tasks necessary  
after meeting up with leia , the film really picks up  
luke continues his training as a pilot and to become a jedi , ben kenobi confronts darth vader , and many other interesting events occur  
star wars is an amazing epic  
the plot is so original and amazing , i cannot believe it  
the special effects , especially for its time , are wonderful and realistic  
the space scenes in particular are the most fun to watch  
the ships flown by all are very unique and creative  
the costumes are also out of this world  
the scenery is so different from anything i have ever seen before  
there are a variety of different very memorable set pieces that will stay with me forever  
the entire premise of star wars is amazing  
the creatures and droids that we see throughout the film are one of a kind  
even the human characters are different  
every character is extremely likable and different from characters from other sci fi films  
the acting on everyone's part is great , especially that of sir alec guinness's "

1," "" the tailor of panama "" is a different kind of spy movie  
despite the presence of pierce brosnan , there is nary a hint of james bond flash here  
instead of big action scenes , leering super villains and empty-headed femme fatales , we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation  
based on the novel by john le carr ? , who also co-wrote the screenplay , the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year : a solid , well-told story  
brosnan plays andy osnard , a british operative walking on thin ice  
his british superiors ship him off to panama , making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement  
osnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co-workers and his new home base  
when shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that , since the creation of the panama canal , the structure is the sole connection between north and south america , he barely keeps from yawning  
brosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007 , investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end  
searching for a way to get information on the government , osnard sets his sights on harry pendel ( geoffrey rush ) , an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite  
harry claims to be a transplant from britain's renowned saville row , but osnard knows his secret : the tailor is an ex-con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle's shop in an insurance scam  
he also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt , having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm  
osnard offers harry a way out  
he will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele  
eager to comply , harry offers what he knows , then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing  
before long , he is forced to spy on his loving wife , louisa ( jamie lee curtis ) , an aide to the canal director  
harry's little lies build , eventually taking on a life of their own  
osnard turns in reports about the "" silent opposition , "" a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal  
the bogus revelation proves explosive , leading to meetings in washington d  c  over how to best protect the vital waterway  
meanwhile , osnard wallows in his newfound status , enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co-worker  
and harry grows ever more fretful , fearing the consequences if his clients , not to mention his wife , learn about his lies  
geoffrey rush is wonderful as harry , fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings , all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor  
rush makes harry a credible figure , presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity  
after gaining fame playing larger than life characters , rush flips everything around for this role , using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems  
although she gets far too little screen time , jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her  
of the central characters , she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self-confidence  
curtis is one of my favorite female actors ; whiplash smart , sultry and charismatic , she deserves more than supporting roles  
speaking of supporting characters , there are some great ones here  
harold pinter is amusing as harry's uncle benny , who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways  
also shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker , who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr  strangelove school of armed patriotism  
but the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson , both outstanding as two wounded activists  
their presence adds weight to the story , reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men , there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal  
director john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location  
instead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop , he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there  
the metropolis , described by one character as "" casablanca without heroes "" pulsates with life , underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people  
 "" the tailor of panama "" succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment "

1,"in october of 1997 , audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer  
the film went on to gross over 70 million dollars in the u  s  , and even developed a cult following , much like the previous year's 100 million dollar grossing scream  
when the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend , it looked like a wonderful follow-up  
did it live up to the first film ? 
the answer is no  
jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james , a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before  
she has been so upset since the incident  
nightmares haunt her all over the place , but she has to move on  
she know attends college , and is best friends with a funny , outgoing girl named karla ( brandy ) , who is trying to hook julie up with will benson , played by newcomer matthew settle  
karla's boyfriend is tyrell , the funny , outgoing type , who is played by soul food's mekhi phifer  
freddie prinze jr  also returns as ray , julie's boyfriend from a year ago  
one morning , julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil  
of course , they answer it correctly , and they are off to the bahamas  
julie wants ray to come , but he declines the offer , so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie  
after they arrive at their hotel , it is just them and the staff on the island  
it starts off as the weekend of their dreams  
something just had to come to mess up the one care-free weekend of julie's life though  
ben willis ( muse watson ) is back , and he isn't letting anyone survive this time  
will ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one ? 
jennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances  
brandy in particular was impressive , considering this is her first feature film  
you could see that the characters were horrified , and they would do anything possible to survive  
matthew settle and freddie prinze jr  are a completely different story  
let's start with settle  
matthew is completely fake in this film  
you could not believe a word coming out of his mouth  
you could tell he was acting , and its reasons like him that this one isn't as good as the first one  
he does do a good job towards the end , but that doesn't clear up the scars he already left on the film  
freddie prinze jr  is almost as bad as matthew settle was  
he is almost completely unbelievable , and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place  
we don't see him as much as settle , otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did  
mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell , but yet again the dialogue is out of place  
the plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie  
i like where the filmmakers went with this second installment , but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one , it would have been a bit better  
the cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful  
there are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel "

1,"at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds  
that's true of home alone 2 and i'd bet money that it's true of home alone 3 ( opening soon )  
but home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way  
the mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays  
four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse  
the littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids' cruelty  
kevin's patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he's going to have to starve  
he attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him  
the fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle  
the knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin  
nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back  
the ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night  
on his way up the stairs , he tells her that "" families suck "" and that he hopes never to see any of his family again  
that night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport  
in a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him  
it's interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children  
first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class  
they're two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child  
meanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true  
he's finally rid of his family ! 
life is a dream come true  
he can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother's secret box  
slowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane  
he grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( "" i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener "" )  
he also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring  
the furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house  
macaulay culkin is cute but he isn't much of an actor  
still , we can see that kevin's character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing  
for example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as "" santa "" is getting in his car  
kevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa  
he learned how to deal with the furnace  
you turn on the lights and it's not so scary anymore  
he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer , who actually turns out to be a nice man  
they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid  
finally , in the last 20 minutes , kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally )  
this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick , and after the movie's genuine dramatic setup , it is dessert  
it's a lot of fun , and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the movie  
on the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie  
john williams' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls , and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings  
but it does have its flaws "

1,"it's tough to really say something nice about a type of person who's so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone , but by god , "" american history x "" does it , and for that , i commend it  
it not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo-nazi skinhead , a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who's not what they are , and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off  
the subject of this film is one of them , but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack  
he's the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in another brilliant stroke , justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks  
he's so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process  
his name is derek vinyard , and he's played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he's almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as , say , malcom x  when we first see him , he's clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast , a devlish goatee , and he's attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets , at least when he doesn't need them  
he so believes in his convictions that he's willing to put his beliefs to the test , even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison , if only for a couple years  
 "" american history x "" is about derek , how he became a neo-nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake  
we see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager , a vicious hate monger , a man having an epiphany , and the man who tries to correct what he's done before - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all sides  
or at least , that's the intention  
the film's framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek's deep space 9 ) , is trying to "" correct "" him  
when the film opens , danny has just written a book report on "" mein kampf , "" landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek's life and how it has gotten him nowhere  
coincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he's cleaned-up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair  
he's just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he's wisened up  
he's no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who's becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle  
but danny won't  
he goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it a couple of years ago  
the film circles around this , then spins off into non-linear flashbacks , all done in black and white  
we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi-sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle-class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on  
to them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop , and he not only speaks elloquently , forcefully , and intelligently , but he backs everything up with political reasons , justifying their rage at least to them  
and frighteningly enough , much of what he says sounds true  
 "" american history x "" is a collection of really great scenes and moments , rather than a cohesive , great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next  
in it , there are some of the best scenes i've seen all year  
one scene features a dinner between derek's family , and his mother's newest boyfriend ( played with reserve by eliott gould ) , a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek's rightist views , launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience ( gould's reaction to derek's final summation is unnerrving )  
another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co-worker ( guy torry ) while folding laundry in prison  
and another soon-to-be-classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year  
there's much more to appreciate , like the acting , which is uniformly good , with stand-outs coming from avery brooks , beverly d'angelo ( as the long-suffering mother ) , and gould ( who has one horrible line , but other than that , comes off with the best performance he's given in what seems like a really long time )  
norton walks off with the film , though , coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble  
in only the fifth movie of his career , norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation , and maybe the best  
there's nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie , spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience , coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando  
that he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing  
sadly enough , this isn't going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be  
it's too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece  
the ending , especially , is pencilled in from other movies , tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon  
some of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches ( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the "" fat skinhead , "" whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more ) , and even the dramatic arc isn't as well travelled  
furlong's danny never seems to really be learning a lesson , since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view , and when he decides to make a change by the end ( which was inevitable ) , it doesn't seem like it has actually arrived there  
even derek's descent into skinhead-dom doesn't seem justified  
though his fireman father ( william russ , the dad from "" boy meets world , "" and don't ask me how i know that ) is killed by a black junkie , and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently , there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs "

1,"_in brief : _ this film needs no introduction  
if you haven't heard of it , then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical , and if you haven't seen it -- well , i suspect you're in a small minority ! 
first thing's first ? is it all it's hyped up to be ? 
well , yes ? and no  
it's a good film , and there's a lot to like about it , but it's not without its problems  
when i saw the first trailer for "" titanic "" , it was when i went to see "" bean "" last summer , i think , my intial reaction was -- ain't that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real-life tragedy ? ! 
i mean , what's happened to hollywood's script-writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ? 
gads , whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ? 
i was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i wasn't alone in that respect  
it's when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) and anyone who'd been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice ! 
i didn't see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) , 
so i went with a slightly more open mind , but i still didn't think i'd enjoy it much  
did i ? yes and no  
mainly yes , i'm happy to say  
the first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i'll talk about that later ? ) but because the re-created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron's directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the "" human "" aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting  
the film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a' course ! 
 : - ) )  
well , it's an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat  
does it work here ? 
in script form it doesn't add all that much to the story  
what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film  
her presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her  
also impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving  
it's an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack's "" rescuing "" rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching  
in fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance  
it's engaging , touching and very enjoyable  
there's more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well , simply because you know it's not going to be a happy ending  
which leads us to the second half of the film  
we all knew it was coming  
i'm sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it , because as he's stated in interviews , the real thrust of the story ( for him ) was the sinking , and the jack/rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film  
i think that understates the importance of the romance , as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die  
the iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour  
and it is an hour  
my goodness , we don't miss a second of that hour ? 
gratuitous ? well , perhaps not by today's standards , i'm sure there's been far worse produced under the banner of "" entertainment "" in other films  
but i certainly wasn't prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be  
not that i'd expect the word "" understatement "" to be part of cameron's vocabulary ( he who brought us such , umm , vivid films as "" terminator 2 "" and "" aliens "" )  
is it overdone ? 
i thought so  
understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy  
no , no one expected a happy ending , but i didn't quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film's second half  
still , whether it was overdone and heavy-handed or not , if it was the shock-factor cameron was after it worked , because i was shocked and moved , in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears ! 
you really couldn't help but get emotionally involved , whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose's overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack , or that jack would rescue rose , or that they would both survive  
perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk , and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface  
the bit where rose lets go of jack's hand , while promising she'll never let go in her heart was particularly heart-wrenching , and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image , to put no fine a point on it  
i loved the ending , however , which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half  
so , we've established that the film is powerful and moving , if the last hour was rather excessive  
haven't mentioned the script  
plot-wise it's ok , though the jack/rose relationship was beautifully developed , but i've a feeling that's to the actors credit if anything  
as for the dialogue ? well , titanic is set in 1912  
it's a period drama "

1,"as any sociologist will attest , your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult  
parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives  
but if your upbringing is marred with violence , hate and dysfunctionality , then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome  
`affliction' explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood  
the man in question is wade whitehouse ( nick nolte )  
here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface  
he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me  
but as you scratch beneath the surface , something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head  
we see that he is a mean-tempered person  
he has a hard time taking control of his emotions , which usually gets the better of him  
he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person , but something is sparking a tendency towards violence  
he also has tremendous problems with relationships  
he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter  
but his bearish persona and stature alienates her  
he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him  
his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl ( sissy spacek ) at risk  
she tries to remain true to him and supportive , but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person , relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point  
finally , he is spiteful and vindictive  
as a rejected father , he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless  
as the town's only police officer , he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died  
we can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain  
he is a prisoner and a slave to it  
he is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension  
what kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him ? 
we learn that the answer is his father ( james coburn )  
this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet  
he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist  
we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks  
to heighten the father's churlishness , the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person  
very effective  
today , wade's dad is quite elderly , but still manages to instill fear into a grown man  
the influence that the father possesses is inescapable , and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade  
the result is every son's nightmare ? becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be  
this is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama , and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity  
he's a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father  
coburn displays heft as the bitter dad  
but , it's most certainly not saturday-night-friendly fare  
there's nothing light or fluffy about this film  
that may turn many moviegoers away  
but it's certainly worth noting that this is a well-acted drama showcasing nolte's and coburn's raw acting talents "
1,"trekkies , roger nygard's energetic and hilarious documentary , brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions  
the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non-fans alike  
 ( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs  trekker polemic as not worth arguing about  ) 
the good-spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable , loud giggles , yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe  
denise crosby , who played tasha yar on "" star trek : the next generation , "" serves as the host  
in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary ( oed )  
 ( the oed cites a february , 1976 caption in the "" new yorker "" as the first recorded usage of the word  ) 
unless you've been to the conventions , i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans  
one pointed out , apologetically , that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate  
others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended , several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of  
my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams  
arguably the most famous of all the trekkies , she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die-hard fans do  
her claim to fame is that , as a juror on the whitewater trial , she wore it in court as well  
 "" every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcan-like stoicism , "" she says , describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession  
she doesn't quite understand all of the uproar  
 "" i'm an officer of the federation 24 hours a day , "" she reminds us  
her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith  
along with the laugher the show evokes , there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty  
and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment  
few other avocations could give this much satisfaction  
these people are having the time of their lives  
 ( for the record , i'm not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies  ) 
the film interviews the various star trek series's stars as well as its fans  
the stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and would soon fade , but over twenty years later , the conventions are still going strong  
filled with anecdotes , the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions  
at one , the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel  
after appearing briefly , he drank some water and left  
they decided to auction off his half-empty glass , joking that it had the "" q virus  "" 
the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too  
with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity  
not just flitting among people , the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies  
one guy is a trekkie cross-dresser , another dresses her cat , and then there is the dentist  
the dentist has his entire office made up to look like a star trek set  
he , his oral hygienists , his receptionist , his wife , and his kids wear the outfits all of the time  
it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home , but not his family  
for variety , he and his family do change characters from time to time  
he says his patients like it  
well , there was this one complainer , but he had a problem with his bill anyway "
1," "" love is the devil "" is a challenging film , munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot , perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist's psyche rather than the artist's lifeline  
watching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter  
everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon , the film's subject , looked at it personally  
but while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what's going on  
exactly what was i looking at ? 
watching this film , i wasn't sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous  
directed ( and written ) by john maybury , "" love is the devil "" is stylish masterpiece for the senses  
everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing  
the camera angles are ferociously askew , and the close-ups are uncomfortably too close  
the editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon's world and psyche  
as such , there is no real story  
i've not heard much about francis bacon that i didn't read prior to the film , but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s , drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like  
he was one of the first to really come out of the closet , and in interviews , he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty  
as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi , he's like a foppish and self-absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero  
he lives life the way he wants to live it , to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him  
it's as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself ( "" champagne for my real friends , and pain for my sham friends , "" he says one night at the bar he frequents )  
 "" love is the devil "" chronicles the latter part of his life  
bacon , well-known in his mid-life , awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor  
he walks in , unafraid of what he finds , and discovers a thief , george dyer ( daniel craig )  
bacon gives him an offer : if he spends the night with him , he can take anything he wants in the morning  
george agrees to this , and off to bed he goes , but ends up staying with him , for whatever reason  
the film shows their lives together , at least in reference to one another  
while creating bacon's world of friends ( like "" high art , "" this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood ) , the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant  
bacon is haughty and bizarre ; george is simple and doesn't understand bacon in the least , especially not his paintings  
while watching this , that's basically all i thought was there  
the film has a hypnotic feel , free of any restraints of form , and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about  
once the film is over , it's easier to piece it together  
i kept on thinking about this film , wondering what the point to all of it was  
someone doesn't merely make a film of all style and no substance at all , and if they do , they do it by accident , but still allow some substance to creep in  
thinking about it , i remembered how the two fed off of eachother  
i thought about how bacon was a masochist , in love with cruelty ( in one scene , he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight , and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer's head splashes across his face ; in another scene , he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein's "" battleship potemkin "" ) , and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain  
he drove him over the edge , and for him that was love , even if it wasn't for george  
i guess that explains the title  
a bit  
that's great and all , but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning  
i wish it hadn't reduced itself to making some point about humanity , about how love is the most selfish thing in the world ( and it is , if you look at it a certain way )  
or maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man's twisted pysche  
it's almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man's uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience's throat  
that way you don't reduce your film to something it's just not  
i can't say i totally enjoyed "" love is the devil , "" though "

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
on december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream  
although the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre  
the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes  
the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost  
scream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line's a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight  
and scream's rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion  
it's hard to understate this last point  
mr  williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director )  
indeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr  williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion's share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2's theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional "" a film by wes craven "" drapes the film's title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads "" written by kevin williamson "" , an affirmation of the screenwriter's contribution to the project which may be unprecedented  
 ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of "" a film by "" is attained  ) 
and , much like mr  tarantino's screenwriting , mr  williamson's work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters  
in scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels  
scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr  williamson's rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel  
while the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr  williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it's only at about the film's midway point when it becomes engaging  
like its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film's principal narrative ; this time around , we're following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the "" true life "" events behind the first film has been turned into a movie )  
however , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i've ever seen )  
there are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn't nearly as cleverly frightening as scream's ; while the first film's preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical  
flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film  
the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney  
they're joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded  
the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn't necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ? 
there's a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney's new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy's fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale's newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms  buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens' portia di rossi )  
any of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim  
as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit  
one problem that scream didn't have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer  
here ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr  williamson's screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery  
the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements  
 ( it doesn't help matters any that the killer's alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go  ) 
indeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes  
this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it "

1,"warren beatty's "" bulworth "" is a caustic political comedy that doesn't attack any particular political group , but rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system  
some might think this film is vulgar , and in many ways it is  
however , as loud and raucous as it is , "" bulworth "" speaks the truth , which is almost always ugly to hear  
beatty , who directed the film and co-wrote the script with jeremy pikser ( "" the lemon sisters "" ) , stars as incumbent u  s  senator jay billington bulworth , who has one of the best politician names in cinema history  
bulworth is a democrat , and in beatty's view , he is symbolic of everything that has gone wrong with the current democratic party  
once an ideological liberal ( like beatty still is ) , bulworth has long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington  
instead of waging the battles for the impoverished and the downtrodden , which was once the calling card of democrats , bulworth has become another sell-out money hound - if he's not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese , he's making wind-bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement , "" america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium     
blah , blah , blah  "" 
when the film opens , it is a few days before the 1996 primary elections , and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become  
in a fit of desperation , he takes out a $10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino ( part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee ) , and then hires a hit man to kill him , although he doesn't know who the assassin will be , or when the hit will take place  
knowing that he will soon be dead , bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world , which is made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics and the society in general  
at a compton church , he tells the group of african-americans that they will have no power in the u  s  unless they "" put down that malt liquor and chicken wings , and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife  "" 
later , in a particularly hilarious sequence , bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite , then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason he's there is because "" my guys always put the big jews on my schedule  "" 
all throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade , bulworth's chief of staff , dennis murphy ( oliver platt ) , follows behind in a state of constant shock and bewilderment  
platt has some of the movie's funniest scenes , as he makes murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet  
his constant half-truth-telling and spin-doctoring to cover bulworth's stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a self-righteous reporter ( nora dunn ) who acts like murphy's refusal to explain bulworth's actions ( something he really cannot do ) is somehow an act of treason  
when bulworth decides he wants to live after all , and therefore must constantly evade a grim-looking assassin to be who's trailing him at every turn , he hides out in the ghetto , complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears to one of his television interviews  
at this point , beatty abandons much of the political aspect and dives into a cartoonish exploration of the black inner-city experience  
bulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina ( halle berry ) , who he meets at the harlem church rally  
she has a tough-talking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l  d  
 ( don cheadle of "" boogie nights "" ) , who also becomes involved in bulworth's campaign  
some of the scenes in the ghetto ring true , but much of it feels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense inner-city films like "" boyz'n'hood "" ( 1991 ) and "" menace ii society "" ( 1993 )  
 "" bulworth's "" chief liability is beatty's insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap as his new communication device  
instead of speaking at political rallies , he breaks into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hip-hop stars are black  
it's hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad , or whether he's actually that incompetent  
at any rate , the rap sounds more run d  m  c  
than snoop doggy dogg , which makes the film seem dated instead of contemporary  
beatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the inner-city lingo and working that into his speeches , instead of trying to sound like l  l "
1,"at first glance , daylight would seem like your typical disaster movie  
on second glance it looks that way too  
although , as typical disaster movies go , daylight isn't that bad  
admittedly , it seems to rip off a great deal of its plot devices from disaster flicks of days gone by ( think poseidon adventure )  
but the decent dialogue and surprisingly good acting make up for the "" haven't i seen this scene somewhere before ? "" 
feeling that creeps up all too often during the film  
sylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of new york's emergency response team  
by sheer luck , he is in the right place at the right time when disaster strikes the unaware inhabitants of this little film  
 "" what disaster is that ? "" 
you ask , as you inch ever closer to the edge of your seat  
glad you asked  
through a whole sequence of entirely probable events ( about as probable as hitting the lottery ) a large explosion takes place in the lincoln tunnel running under the hudson river in new york city  
the explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends , which causes not only massive loss of life , but traps a dozen people inside the wreckage of the tunnel  
good old sly , who is only feet away from entering the tunnel when it collapses , offers his services to the rescuers , who gladly accept it  
sly then enters the tunnel through a vent shaft ( think judge dredd ) which he can only go in , and not out off , and proceeds to try to rescue those trapped inside  
so begins the fun , but the fun has to be quick , because this tunnel has started to spring a leak  
the acting is about what you would expect of a stallone movie  
not superb by any means , but far above some of his other films ( think judge dredd again )  
daylight's acting is probably average , or a little above , in terms of this sort of genre , starring this particular star  
amy brenneman is the only actor of any note , and she does a pretty good job as stallone's reluctant helper  
oh yeah , stallone's real life son , sage , is in this too  
sage -- nice name  
i guess it could be worse , he could have been named nutmeg or parsley  
note to sage -- you are still young  
go to school and get a good education -- you don't have a future in acting  
the plot runs along the same lines as the acting -- interesting , but predictable  
mostly due to the fact that it was pretty well recycled from a dozen other action flicks  
the biggest problem with a film of this nature is that they try to cram too many things into the movie  
as soon as the cast clears one seemingly impossible hurdle , another one seems to pop right up , even worse than the last one  
i realize that it wouldn't be much of a movie otherwise , but it does make the movie a bit predictable  
adding to the predictability is the cast of characters , which of course , has to include at least one or two difficult people who want to do things their own way and think the qualified guy ( in this case stallone ) doesn't know what he is doing  
why is it in disaster movies we can never have everyone agree with each other and all work together ? 
would this be too much to ask ? 
can't we all just get along ? 
special effects weren't bad -- but i've certainly seen better  
some of the scenes , while fun to watch , were such blatant rip-offs that you had to wonder if scripts from old movies were just copied verbatim  
especially all of the scenes that involved anything underwater ( the tunnel , of course , starts to flood )  
i really expected gene hackman , roddy mcdowell and ernest borgnine to appear at any minute -- i wasn't sure if i was watching daylight or the poseidon adventure  
i suppose if you have to rip off a movie for good ideas , the poseidon adventure is a good one to use  
the underwater sequences ( aside from the deja vu ) were very well shot and worked fairly well  
they were the best part of the movie by a long shot  
better than average stallone flick  
i realize that's not saying much when the man has judge dredd on his resume  
but certainly not up to the standards of cliffhanger "

1,"the booming introduction music finishes , and the camera sweeps over red mountains  
we see two figures looking over a barren , and very red landscape  
they kiss , then walk on  
one of the characters ( schwarzenegger ) slips , and falls  
the glass on his mask cracks  
his face scruches up , and his eye's begin to pop      
then doug quaid , played by schwarzenegger , wakes up  
it's all been a dream  
he wakes up next to his beautiful wife , played by stone , and the film begins    
total recall is a typical sci-fi film wrapped around an intresting ( if far fetched ) plot  
quaid , who has never been to mars , keeps on having dreams of the planet , which has now been colanised  
one day , while riding on a train , he's see's a ad for a company called 'rekall' , which implants memories of a holiday , instead of you actually going there yourself  
quaid chooses the 'secret agent on mars' memory , and then the s * * * really hits the fan  
the implant goes wrong , and quaid really thinks he is an agent on mars for about two minutes , until he goes back to normal and can't remember a thing  
however , everyone he knows ( his workmates , his wife ) turn against him , saying how 'blabbed about mars' and 'blew his cover on the mission' a strange man , called richter , played by ironside , wants to kill him  
quaid , now hopelessly confused , follows the advice given to him , by a 'friend'  
he get's his ass to mars  
mars is ruled by cohagen , played by cox , who charges people for air  
against him are the rebels , who are mainly mutants  
the rebel's need quaid to defeat cohagen , because quaid knows ( but can't remember yet ) about a reactor that produces air  
eventually , quaid kills cohagen , turns on the reactor , saves the planet , and goes away with a beautiful girl , just like the guy at rekall promised him  
throughout this plot , there is huge explosions , thousands of deaths ( and i mean a lot of death ) swearing , sex , and everything else that make's a good verhoeven ( director of basic instinct and starship troopers ) movie  
naturally , there's some pretty imaginative deaths , with arms getting ripped off , someone getting drilled , and heads exploding  
as you can tell , it's violent stuff  
but it's done so stylishly , and of course arnie tones it down with a one liner , that's it excusable  
the acting is variable  
arnie , of course , is useless , but he goes has some good lines , and in the first twenty minutes , he even act's like a normal bloke , not like some action hero  
stone , of course , is useless , making a pretty poor wife , and a pretty poor action hero  
but , she does sex scenes alright  
ticoton ( most recently seen in con air ) , again , is ok , doing some good action , but getting her emotions all wrong  
one minute she hates quaid , the next she loves him , and she never gets this tranisition right  
so , the good guys are awful  
but , the bad guy's are excellent "

 "" both my wife and daughter think i'm this gigantic loser  
and they're right  
i have lost something  
i didn't always feel this sedated  "" 
with that piece of dialogue , we are fully introduced to lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) , a 42 year old man trapped within his own life  
lester works for an advertising agency  
his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid-life crisis he is suffering  
estranged from both his wife and his daughter , lester starts to crack under the stress  
his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies , and sullen apathy  
carolyn burnham ( annette bening ) , is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker  
she carefully tends her rose garden , decorates her home with the best furnishings  
but inside she is desperate  
unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent , she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family  
the third member of this anti-family is jane burnham ( thora birch ) , lester and carolyn's daughter  
a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence , but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction  
this funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple  
not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her  
some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters  
most notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney ) , the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts  
she has almost no dialogue , and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one  
colonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man  
his rage directed almost singularly at his son , ricky ( wes bentley ) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham's  
in fact they are the next door neighbors  
anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in "" american beauty ""  
alan ball , who was the co-executive producer of the hit tv series "" cybil "" and creator of the new sitcom "" oh grow up "" , has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years  
not one character in this film rings falsely  
and the depth of personality in each , is achingly honest and insightful  
the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as "" the graduate "" or "" lolita ""  
kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances  
his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age  
finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become , lester tries to return to his youth  
he quits his job ( actually blackmailing his employer for one year's salary ) , starts smoking pot , fantasizes about his daughter's girlfriend angela ( mena suvari , in a marvelous performance here ) , starts working out , and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet  
mr  spacey's performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous , that we can be certain that come oscar ? time , we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees  
annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career "

1,"in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance  
ever since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80's  
in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world  
you'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open  
in wonder boys his performance isn't showy or a tour de force , it's simple yet truthful  
he embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes  
grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map  
when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms  
grady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy  
their target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for  
leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions  
he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges  
he's portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated  
he reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog )  
whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white  
leer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth  
tobey maguire fits well in the role  
with his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude  
but unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he's a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility  
katie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady's pants  
this is a plot line i had trouble with  
douglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions  
at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it's because i'm jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas's real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones  
seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping  
suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i'm pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas  
there is a movie in there somewhere  
grady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor  
okay , maybe not so chivalrous  
there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , "" she was a junkie for the printed word  
lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice ""  
robert downy j  r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm  
downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual  
he's arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance  
the actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor  
i wish wonder boys had more of him  
searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that's part of its charm  
and maybe i'm a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i'm greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema  
everyone has a sub-genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to "

1,"i rented this movie with very high hopes  
this movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 , and unfortunately , was not as good as i hoped , but was still very intriguing and thought provoking  
first of all , the casting for this film is great  
tobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood  
they play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly  
with a plot as unbelievable as this film , you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast  
tobey and reese ( bud and mary sue parker ) play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability  
william h  macy , an actor i have grown to love over the past year , turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife , a "" colored "" person and his friends , the "" non-colored "" ones  
he also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife  
he does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood  
joan allen is equally great as betty parker , the ideal tv mom  
her character is the most ambitious  
she is very na ? ve , and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that  
her lack of chemistry with macy , which the role calls for , and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific , and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast , then this film would even been even better  
as said before , jeff daniels gives a bad performance  
his character displays the change going on throughout the town , yet he does not display it with enough conviction  
his character is very confusing and he is not very believable  
this film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance  
the movie is very provocative  
it challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today  
i really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up , but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing  
they demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch , but do it in a slow pace  
the only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length  
some films are not meant to be that long  
pleasantville is one of those films  
this film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it  
first , they are amazed by the implementation of color  
then they want to have it  
then they do not want to  
then the war ensues between the colored and non-colored  
this is all strung out over two hours , which was way too long  
some movies need a lot of time  
saving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time  
this film is only two hours long , and seems much longer  
length is everything in films  
if you can nail down the perfect timing and pace , you can win half the battle  
pleasantville can move at a good pace at times , but it is not consistent enough  
overall , pleasantville is a very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days "

1,"in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers  
full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture  
go see it ! 
so , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on "" hard copy "" with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980's  
 "" hard copy "" 's diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman's fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for  
smart replied that she thought kidman's character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal  
 ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband  ) 
smart's got a point  
it wouldn't be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version  
however , given a choice between the mass media 'happening' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later  
real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman  
to die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb  
the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being 'on tv  ' 
of course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon  
but , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily  
kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne  
i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture  
her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates  
kidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell  
she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way  
at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law  
 "" you know , "" she knowingly exclaims , "" gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head  "" 
her husband beams at suzanne's profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters  
this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks  
the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix  
he plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne's sexual favors  
kidman's character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland  
phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course )  
his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain't going anywhere , ever  
phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him  
gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate  
he keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along  
van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn't stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions  
van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to 'get it' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story  
the screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i've heard since heathers  
henry's story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters  
henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic  
danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands  
either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick-or-treat parties  
all-in-all , a wonderful production , well worth your seven bucks ! 
to die for : a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant "

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
james toback's return to directing after a eight-year layoff , two girls and a guy , is a film which is comprised , more or less , of just that : one guy , blake ( robert downey jr  ) ; two girls , carla ( heather graham ) and lou ( natasha gregson wagner ) ; one primary setting ( blake's absurdly spacious bachelor apartment ) , and a great deal of dialogue  
embracing a near real-time approach , this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr  toback for his bantering characters  
fortunately , the film's cast is up to the challenge , and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters , while admittedly variable , are occasionally wickedly amusing  
the film's setup is fairly generic in nature , and opens rather unpromisingly  
we meet self-possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou , both waiting outside a soho loft  
as they engage in idle chatter , it is revealed that they're both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport , and it doesn't take long for them to come to the realisation that they're being two-timed by the same guy  
more indignant with him than catty with each other , the duo break into blake's loft and await his arrival for a confrontation  
it's when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride  
played with magnificent bombast by mr  downey jr  , blake is a cad , all right , but a captivatingly dynamic , blusterous , and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights  
it's fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat , and perhaps the film's best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return , allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others , but by his own innate behaviour  
whether he's flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi , or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds ( carla , lou , and his unseen sickly mother ) , it's never less than wildly entertaining and insightful  
though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one-man show -- a typical afternoon in the life of blake , if you will -- carla , and then lou , reveal themselves , and the sparks begin to fly  
 ( one of the great touches in the film is how blake , when startled by carla's unannounced appearance , begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat's out of the bag  ) 
double-teamed by the understandably aggrieved women ( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful -- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy ) , an increasingly-flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self-righteous declarations against their verbal jabs  
surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters , two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off-limits for this film  
however , it'd be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou's outrage to full feature-length , and it's as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel  
the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever , the film's tempo loses its liveliness , the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion , and several sequences fall flat  
subtle and not-quite-subtle allusions are made ( a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall ) , and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale  
one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla  
two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter , long-running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene -- contractually-obligated to deliver an r-rated film , mr  toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled-down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc-17 rating in favour of an r -- and while admittedly titillating , the net effect of the vignette on the film's thematic narrative is rather dubious  
if anything , two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr  downey jr  , whose versatility is put to the test in this film  
he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled , from self-assured to disconcerted , yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered  
it's a wonderful performance in a role custom-tailored for him ; mr  toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr  downey jr  was arrested on drug charges , and it's hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character -- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection , blake's self-chiding to "" get [his] shit together "" is disquieting in its resonance  
while mr  downey jr  's showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film , both actresses are solid in more broadly-observed roles

1,"what a great film  
what a stunning , touching , heart-wrenching , heart-warming , life-affirming , miraculous film  
>from its opening moments , _life is beautiful_ walks that fine line between serious tragedy and uplifting comedy  
a car with no brakes speeds through the town , and guido ( roberto benigni ) motions people to move out of the way  
they mistake him to be the fascist president , traveling to their town that day  
heil ! 
heil ! 
huh ? 
shortly thereafter , the president drives through , and people stare , with blank faces  
this is standard , but somehow fresh and postmodern stuff : the clown who is also a jew , triumphs over the anti-semitic society in which he = lives  
granted , _the great dictator_ comes to mind--charlie chaplin+s almost masterpiece  
i think lib ( which benigni wrote and directed ) trumps gd in one essential point : chaplin+s jewish barber gives a great speech at the climax , but to do so , he had to break completely from character  
benigni is given a similar situation : he is mistaken as a fascist dignitary , and must explain to a classroom filled with schoolchildren = on how scientists have concluded that aryans are the superior race  
benigni+s guido stays in character , and delivers the speech , keeping = the subject matter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept  
it = is one of the great satirical scenes in modern cinema  
there are many other scenes , especially in the first half , which are bright and loopy and funny and silly  
slapstick reigns , and although the film is subtitled , there was no doubt that a universal language was being conveyed  
and although it+s focus is on the courtship of guido = to dora ( played by nicoletta braschi , benigni+s real life wife ) , a silent undercurrent creeps in  
this is clearly a racist society , evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others , and it will soon affect him and = his family  
the second half of the film takes place five years later , in an unnamed concentration camp , where guido , dora ( by her insistence ) , and their five-year old son , giosu=e9 ( giorgio cantarini ) , are deported  
guido , seeing the horrors , is desperate to protect his wife and child  
for = his wife , who is separated from him , he must find ways to communicate to = her that he is all right  
for his son , ( and this is the most controversial part of the film ) he convinces the youngster that this is all one big elaborate game : it+s rules include hiding , being very quiet , and learning to not ask for seconds  
which raises the big questions : how do we deal with pain ? 
with persecution ? 
with injustice on the worst level ? 
it+s said that tragedies bring out the best in people , finding strengths they did not realize they had  
other times they deteriorate , become overwhelmed = with little strength or incentive to swim  
sometimes even , people giggle in these moments , as if there were a vacant emotion behind them , yearning for some brightness to soothe their wounds  
benigni+s guido realizes this  
he is the clown , but he is not a fool  
he sees the slurs and the vandalism , and while feeling the weight of = the verbal attacks , he still has the audacity to see if everyone around = him , perhaps even the antagonists , laugh  
his liberty is stripped , but not his dignity , and certainly not the dignities of those around him  
it+s obvious from the onset that here is someone who is very much against fascism and the preposterousness of an aryan nation , but does so with a grinning , joyful demeanor  
perhaps that is a form of denial  
perhaps his alternate reality is all that he could muster ( not unlike the very different _brazil_ )  
or    
perhaps this is an example of great fortitude , with no weapons but = wit  
whatever his purposes is subject to debate , but also a sure sign that this is one of the great three-dimensional characters , stranded amidst = a terrifyingly risky concept  
surprisingly , it works  
it is an important footnote that this film was not intended to be an accurate reflection of the holocaust  
it+s not that the atrocities are trivialized , far from it  
they don+t have to be broadcast and explicitly shown to muster the same horror--less is more "

1,"the year is 1962 and the military is conducting nuclear testings  
involved in these tests is hank marshall ( jones ) , an army colonel who is critical of the above-ground tests that are being done  
he urges below-ground tests which no one will consider at the time until it is learned that the soviets have conducted underground tests of their own  
marshall is also troubled by a turbulent marriage to carly ( lange ) who is topless on the base's beach in full view of the entire personnel  
hank's reaction is one of amusement  
he's been here before and he deals with it in the only way he knows how  
the problem is carly is a manic-depressive and when she isn't flirting with any man who happens to be near her , she's fantasizing about a fictious world where she'd rather be  
typical of the mental illness , she also is promiscuous and foul-tempered  
the mood swings are quick and violent and the torment she puts her husband and their two daughters is considerable  
from hank's reports which state his opposition to the army's methods of testing , he is transferred from hawaii to alabama  
carly patterns herself after movie stars and tries to become marilyn monroe , bleach-blond and all  
the new home in alabama is pretty run-down and depressing and sets carly off on a violent tantrum  
after meeting his new commanding officer ( booth ) , hank sees an all too familiar pattern begin to repeat  
carly openly flirts with the co  hank tries to deal with the situation , but his only resort is to carry her off and throw her into a nearby pool  
arguments ensue  
the family becomes even more alienated  
the co is very interested in pursuing an encounter with carly and sends hank off to observe an underground test which causes the irradiation of two local ranchers , much to the vocal objections of hank , who spots them but is unable to cancel the detonation of the bomb  
back at home , the two girls try to hold things together but they wonder why their father can't deal with their mother's problems  
one daughter says , "" he's blind and she's crazy  "" 
the other answers , "" they're perfect for each other  "" 
it reaches the breaking point when the older girl ( locane ) and a boy , the co's son ( o'donnell ) see her mother and the co making love in an abandoned shed  
she forces her mother to tell hank and get it all out into the open  
hank returns home and finds his wife in the middle of a musical put on by the military wives , including the co's wife ( snodgress )  
he confronts the c  o  
but not about carly  
he is upset over the coverup surrounding the accident during the testing  
a fight breaks out between the two when the co accuses hank of not being able to satisfy his wife  
hank is arrested  
what follows is manipulation and revenge on the part of the co  he convinces carly to commit hank to a hospital for observation  
instead , they fill him with so many drugs that he can barely cope  
he foams at the mouth and cannot even finish sewing a leather wallet as presents for his daughters  
carly is determined to free her husband from the clutches of the army and succeeds in doing so only by being the strong one in the family for the first time  
the film has an upbeat ending with hope that the family has found a way to deal with its problems  
the performances are solid throughout  
jones is sympathetic and loving and is most effective in those quiet moments when he tries to deal with his wife's rage  
he comforts her and offers protection "
1,"after a rather disappointing "" mary railly "" , stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise  
this is one of the best surprises of this season -- a sweet , small budget comedy with a big heart  
in fact it's not even a comedy  
it's a drama or even more precise -- a clever satire on human relationships and needs  
based on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby , ``high fidelity'' is a wry and likable story about a man's quest for fulfillment and happiness  
rob gordon was a dj  
it seems that he could make everything spin -- except his own life  
now he owns championship vinyl , a little musical store , somewhere in new york  
when he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend , a gorgeous blond attorney , life suddenly looses every purpose  
decimated , humiliated and on the verge of a mental ( and emotional ) breakdown , he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been -- about what's right and what's important  
he starts "" categorizing "" life , dividing it into "" top 5 lists ""  
and the most important is the "" top 5 list "" over the most painful breakups of his life , starting with 5th grade , when he found his young girlfriend with another boy  
though you might think that people change , grow more mature with age , it just doesn't seem that way and all rob's relationships were different versions of that first  
where did he go wrong ? 
was it he that screwed up ? 
or maybe life just stinks ? 
while he is lost in his own self-pity , he must think of the "" top 5 list "" over his needs for the future , find the right elements and mix his life together  
with clever parallels to the cult of celebrity , music and with incredibly direct narration , it addresses the average audience member , in other words -- people like you and me  
although a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter ______ and frears , the director , the acting is equally important as the written word  
and here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned  
he is simply superb  
it is as much his movie as it is frears'  
the film would not be the same without him  
cusack -- whose character is sadder , wiser and 35 -- brings intelligence and warmth to post- mod irony  
most of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera -- not an easy task -- but cusack pulls it off  
his interpretation feels so emotionally right , so incredibly realistic and precise that frears' message simply can't be ignored or overseen  
the other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job  
both ______ and jack black are fabulous  
even catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts , not just looks beautiful  
however , the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as rob's co-worker and friend dick  
this is such an impressive achievement that it's almost worth a oscar-nomination  
he is simply a joy to behold  
otherwise , everyone are in their place , and at the right time -- all part of frears' colorful blend  
pretty much like edward norton's "" keeping the faith "" , this film doesn't follow any formula or belong to any genre -- it's dramatic , tragic , sarcastic , comic and even cynical , but never bitter or angry  
it's a little bit of everything , pretty much like life itself  
nothing seems unreal or staged  
it reflects reality as a mirror  
as you watch it , you go through the same emotional problems as the main character  
you feel and think and reflect  
this effect has become a rarity nowadays  
although it's primarily about the perils of love , ``high fidelity'' is secondarily about pop music  
rob owns championship vinyl and his employees , timid dick ( todd louiso ) and overbearing barry ( jack black ) , are fellow music snobs "

1,"hedwig ( john cameron mitchell ) was born a boy named hansel in east berlin  
as a teen seeking his "" other half , "" he reluctantly agrees to a sex change operation in order to marry american g  i  
luther ( maurice dean wint )  
the operation , performed by a hack surgeon , is botched , and the "" angry inch "" is all that's left  
now a "" she "" , hedwig comes to america , is abandoned by luther , forms a rock band and falls for her 17-year old lover/prot ? g ? , tommy , only to be rejected by him later , too  
she and her band , the angry inch , shadows the now-famous tommy gnosis across the us ( for revenge ? ) , but hedwig is really in search of her lost other half in "" hedwig and the angry inch  "" 
first time helmer john cameron mitchell , along with composer/lyricist stephen trask , created and starred in their acclaimed off-broadway production that has become the movie  
and quite a movie it is in its eclectic variety of songs , outrageous costumes , sets and makeup and , especially , a riveting performance by mitchell as the title character  
mitchell and trask have reinvented the movie musical and couple it with the underlying story of just whom hedwig is and what she is looking for  
i am , by far , not a big fan of musicals  
sure , there are exceptions , like bob fosse's "" all that jazz "" and "" cabaret , "" but , for the most part , they are just not my cup of tea  
 "" hedwig and the angry inch "" is an exception , though , with its combination of humor , wit and a collection of tunes that covers musical styles ranging from "" the rocky horror picture show "" and meatloaf to david bowie to the sex pistols  
the original songs , by stephen trask ( also appearing as one of the members of the band the angry inch ) , are full of energy and variety and , even though it's not my kind of music , i found every one entertaining and fun  
the audience i saw "" hedwig "" with thought so , too  
the main attraction to this one-man/woman show is the presence of its star  
john cameron mitchell gives a solid , sometimes fun , sometimes angry performance as a person searching for self-enlightenment and love  
as a young boy growing up in east berlin , hansel is abused by his g  i  
father and raised by his german mother in a tiny flat so small that "" mother would make me play in the oven "" where he listened to pop music on armed forces radio  
later , as a young man , he meets luther , another g  i  
and is swept off of his feet  
the ensuing angry inch incident comes soon after  
flash forward to a trailer park in junction city , kansas , and luther is leaving hedwig for another boy  
frustrated and broke , she takes on baby-sitting and the odd "" job "" to make ends meet  
she also forms a band with four korean housewives and the musical talent of hedwig is born  
she meets , falls for and loses young tommy , who steals her songs and goes off to become a rock sensation  
jealous and angry , hedwig and her new band begins a campaign to shadow tommy's tours and , with the help of her manager , phyllis stein ( andrea martin ) , is trying get a law suit going against the star for stealing her songs  
hedwig and the angry inch get gigs , not coincidentally , at a chain of seafood restaurants that just happen to be next to the forums where tommy gnosis is playing  
things finally come to a head , so to speak , in new york city  
the popularity of the off-broadway musical and its offshoots have garnered a ready-made audience base for "" hedwig  "" 
the wit , humor , music and search for identity has great appeal to young adults , but the charismatic presence of mitchell makes this a cut above what it could have been  
it is this one-man/woman show that casts its spotlight on its "" internationally ignored "" rock star and mitchell is outstanding in the role  
there isn't a lot going on with other characters , though there are amusing little sidebars , like hedwig's backup singer/lover , yitzak ( miriam shor ) , deciding to break away from the band to join a polynesian road show of "" rent "" as a puerto rican drag queen  
the low budget that the moviemakers have for the production belies the quality of the film  
attention to details - hedwig's costumes and outrageous "" cabaret "" -like makeup ; the seedy trailer park setting ; and , the kitschy seafood restaurants - are loads of fun to watch and lend the appropriate air to the proceeds , all on what has to be a beer budget  
 "" hedwig and the angry inch "" may not be for everybody , but the energy of the effort , the songs , the imaginative sets and costumes and a fast steady pace make it a pleasure to watch  
if you're a fan of contemporary , edgy music , it is an even bigger draw "

1,"there seem to be two reactions to dark city  
you either love it or you are unimpressed  
count me as a "" love it  "" 
as good as the crow and spawn are , dark city is better  
where the former two have a specific comic-book following , the latter is an original work with the potential for broader appeal  
it has a similar look to the others , but dark city is much more thoughtful and much less violent  
not clever or complex , the story is still fascinating , like a selection from the twilight zone  
a man ( rufus sewell ) is awakened in his bathtub by a man with a syringe  
surprised , the attacker runs off  
the dazed man gets out of the tub and finds a woman's body in the room  
a mysterious caller warns him to leave the apartment immediately , so he packs some clothes and leaves , never sure why he's leaving or what he's fleeing  
ghoulish figures in long coats recognize the man and chase him through the dark city , hounding him like figures in a nightmare  
an odd blast of willpower allows the man to dream himself free from his pursuers long enough to check his i  d  
the amnesiac learns that he is not dreaming and that his name is john murdoch  
now if only he could remember the rest of his life     
dark city is good on many levels  
first , the look of the movie is excellent  
give credit to production designers george liddle and patrick tatopolous for creating a coherent look from diverse elements  
there are visual elements from the american 1920s-60s , mixed with dickens-era urban industrial elements  
it is all pulled together in a sad , dark look reminiscent of the diner in edward hopper's painting , nighthawks  
proyas' use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the film's world ( for not only does the audience see the city a model , but so do the ghouls )  
the look is like a cross between tim burton's batman and the bleak animation of the brothers quay  
second , the editing of the film is good  
the pacing is on track , and the plot is revealed , the "" amnesia "" explained , in satisfying increments  
also , the stylized editing within each scene gives the movie a tense , caffeinated look  
third , the special effects are well used  
they look good , but more importantly , the right effects are used for the right job  
one example stands out in my mind : the coated figures who haunt the city can attack telekinetically  
a simple ripple effect is used  
a more showy effect could have been chosen , but then it would have just been gratuitous  
restraint was shown where necessary , letting the more critical effects look more impressive  
finally , like gattaca , dark city spends a just a little effort striving for mythical significance  
unlike gattaca , the story is just open-ended and non-literal enough to be successful  
john murdoch's recovery from amnesia is tied to the passing of the night , and the hopeful coming of the dawn  
his struggle with amnesia is both figuratively and literally the struggle of all mankind ( at least in his world ) "
1,"plot : a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side  
but this new guy is not like all the others , he's got ambition , he's got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster  
violence , lots of swearing and betrayals ensue  
critique : a very good , serious-minded , unique british gangster flick which misses the "" great "" mark by way of an annoying voice-over popping up throughout the film and a so-so ending  
here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix  
okay , so it's not entirely new , but it's definitely original when all put together as done here  
the thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place  
it's 1968 and these dudes are looking good ! 
yes , it's all about the suits , fellas    the 
italian shoes , the cufflinks , the ties and the birds ( that's ladies , for those uninitiated ) hanging around you  
here are a bunch of horrible men , gangsters if you will , looking sharp , talking shit and busting heads all over the place  
but that's not the basis of this movie  
the basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group , the excellent david thewlis , and one of his cronies , paul bettany , also extremely good in this film , and how the power , sex appeal and coolness of one , affects the other  
you know how there are always these "" hanger-on "" gangster types who latch on to the godfathers , the leaders , the top dogs of every crime organization ? 
well , most of the time , these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person    that 
is , their boss  
so all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence  
but this film brings the betrayals , the messed up loyalties , the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package  
of course , director paul mcguigan isn't trying to be guy ritchie here , and doesn't over-stylize his presentation , jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix  
nope , he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this  
the first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he's attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty ! 
 ( "" look into my eyes ! "" ) 
in fact , the last time that i've seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers' miller's crossing  
scary shite  
but there's an ever better scene than that in this film  
this one features bettany , once again , slowly torturing , hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster ( from that man's point-of-view ) , but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes , one by one ( that's right , he "" does "" the guy in his underwear )  
that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film , especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss ( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman ? )  
but the flick's not perfect  
in fact , i didn't mind malcolm mcdowell's voice-over narration at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) , he came in every now and then , and rarely added anything of interest to the plot  
all he seemed to do was swear and call people the c-word umpteen times , and even described one scene as it was happening ( ""    so 
i opened the door , then went up the lift , etc     "" -it's 
like , yeah , i know that already , i could see it on the screen ! ! 
overdone  )  
i also didn't quite "" buy "" the ending of the movie , which despite being original , seemed a little unbelievable , especially when you consider that it's supposed to be taking place 30 years later , and folks still seem to be holding grudges , still in love , still living in the same apartments ? ? ! ? 
i mean , c'mon "

he has done films since then such as basic instict and starship troopers

in a verhoeven movie a guy doesn't get shot once in the chest- he gets shot many times all over the body  
robocop takes place in detroit in the future  
things are pretty bleak  
the company ocp rules the city with an iron fist and is moving in on running the police force  
peter weller plays a cop who goes on a mission with his partner , nancy allen  
peter weller goes in an empty room alone and gets killed  
meanwhile ocp has a failed demonstration of a ed-209 model robot crime fighter  
someone comes up with the idea of having a cyborg robocop so they use any parts worth scalvaging from peter weller and make him into the robocop the movie is titled after  
the plot of this movie generally runs at a decent pace  
it drags a bit towards the end with robocop wanting to finish everybody off , but plot twists keep it exciting  
the acting is bad from weller when he is human , but very good when he is robocop  
nancy allen does a decent job  
this movie doesn't leave itself open for a sequel exactly  
but they made one anyway  
enter    
robocop 2 starring : peter weller and nancy allen directed by : irvin kershner 
detroit is in a more bleak state than it was in the first film  
ocp is trying to develop an improved 'robocop 2' that will be more than a match for criminals  
most of the police force is on strike due to ocp taking it over , leaving robocop to be the police force in the city  
this film is pretty bizaare  
it has a 13 year-old drug-lord who curses as much as eddie murphy , even more violence than the original , and some more humor  
the plot of this movie is pretty large , almost too much so  
there are three or four plot lines weaving around that don't really match up  
the effects are still decent though  
this sequel isn't more of the same really , just a darker version robocop dealing more with drugs than with armed criminals  
if you liked the first one , watch this  
but be dissapointed  
so later comes    
robocop 3 starring nancy allen and robert john burke 
ocp is now owned by a large japanese company  
robocop joins a band of rebels to counter-attack the evil empire , i mean ocp

1,"very few people would be unaware of beavis & butt-head ( both created and narrated by mike judge )  
they are the two animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know to human kind  
you may have seen them on their television program , as they snigger and make lude remarks about women , anything related to sex , and the music film clips that they watch  
in beavis & butt-head do america the pair finally make their big screen debut , to the delight of some , and the deplore of others  
beavis & butt-head ( yes , those are their real names ) , are two very ugly teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones  
they live their lives in front of the television  
the worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen  
this happens as they sleep , and when they awake it takes them a few minutes just to decipher that the television has gone  
beavis even tries to use the remote , though there is no television there  
the two spot a van outside and two sinister looking men carrying a television  
even at this point they have no idea what has happened  
they look around , seeing all the evidence , but are completely oblivious to the fact that these men have just stolen their television  
before the movie i knew that they were stupid , but i didn't realise just how stupid  
this is typical of their behaviour throughout the film  
eventually they realise that their television has been stolen , so they leave their sofa to go search for a television  
luck would have it that they stumble into a hotel room ( looking for a television ) where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it is to kill his wife  
this man , thinking that beavis & butt-head are the assigned killers , tells them that they can have $10 , 000 if they "" do his wife ""  
beavis & butt-head , being the ignorant fools that they are , think that he is offering them $10 , 000 dollars to have sex with his good looking wife  
they are taken to the airport where they fly to las vegas to "" do her ""  
to them , this is the best day of their lives  
not only are they going to lose their virginity ( one of their lifelong aims ) , but most importantly , they will have enough money to buy a big screen tv  
inevitably they become caught up in a huge crime , and unbeknown to them , are tracked across the country by the fbi  
oddly enough , it is their complete stupidity that spares them from being caught , as a result the fbi is convinced they are criminal masterminds  
they end up travelling right across america , visiting places such as the hoover dam and washington dc  
the irony is that although they visit so many grand and spectacular locations , their one time out in the big world away from their television , they are completely oblivious to it  
at old faithful they are far more fascinated with the infra-red operated urinals than with the geyser itself  
beavis & butt-head essentially have the journey of their lives  
they even get to meet the president  
but all they care about is getting their television back , and losing their virginity  
this is one of the many reasons that the film is so funny - it's unbelievable just how stupid they are , and how they can be so oblivious to everything around them  
the humour is certainly crude , but then beavis & butt-head are just that ; crude , lude and rude  
in the end you can't help but feel sorry for them , a pair of anti-social couch potatoes whose life is television  
in this respect , and also with regard to authority ( such as the fbi ) mike judge is quite critical of amercian society  
if you are easily offended , or find this pair particularly annoying , steer clear  
otherwise , it should keep you laughing the whole way through  
one note of warning : don't take friends who like to imitate beavis & butt-head    "

summoning up the audacity to fall in love is a harder job  
if you're a total jerk like melvin udall is , the odds are even more against you  
melvin ( jack nicholson ) is a successful romance author who is just the opposite of what you would expect someone in that profession to be  
a solitary man hidden away in his new york apartment with no human interaction and not even a hint of ever having been in a passionate relationship , he avoids the outside world as much as possible  
his obsessive-compulsive disorder rules his life as he uses several different bars of soap to wash his hands and refuses to step on a crack on the sidewalk  
 ( there's a great scene when he has to cross a floor made of mosaic tiles -- _very_small_ mosaic tiles  ) 
melvin has some great lines  
when his publisher's receptionist asks him how he writes women so well in his books , he responds "" i think of men and i take away reason and accountability  "" 
don't get him wrong , he's not merely a misogynist  
setting his sights higher than that , he's also a homophobe , racist , anti-semite , xenophobe , animal-hater and intensely dislikes people who talk in metaphors  
when we first meet him , he's busy dumping a neighbor's dog down the garbage chute  
he's an equal opportunity bigot  
he does venture outside his apartment every day to eat breakfast at a local cafe  
melvin is such a grouchy curmudgeon that waitress carol connelly ( helen hunt ) is the only one willing to wait on him  
and she's none too happy about it  
when carol doesn't show up for work , melvin's routine is shot and he's determined to do something about it  
tracking down her address , he shows up at her place begging her to come back to work so that he can eat breakfast  
the fact that she's a poor single mother caring for a chronically ill son doesn't appear to phase him , he wants his food  
much more upsetting is that his gay artist neighbor simon bishop ( greg kinnear ) is brutally attacked during a robbery  
this doesn't upset melvin much ( "" don't worry , you'll be back on your knees in no time "" ) but when he is bullied into taking care of simon's dog , his life is turned topsy-turvey  
melvin is sequestered because he's afraid of what's out there on the other side of his apartment door  
he has to make sure it's ritualistically locked three times to keep the world on its proper side  
when he brings the dog home he reluctantly grows fond of it , talking to it and taking it everywhere he goes  
this little crack in his emotional armor opens him up  
hiding behind his need for carol to return to work so she can serve him , he pays for a specialist to treat her son  
he even develops a friendship with simon  
all three people are heavily damaged  
melvin has retreated from life in his apartment  
carol has devoted herself to her son , convinced that she has to give up her life for him  
simon is estranged from his parents and his friends disappear when he is hospitalized and his money runs out  
a more unlikely trio to form relationships , you'd rarely see  
and in the midst of it all , there are some wonderful moments  
melvin is hilarious in his grouchiness and touching as he attempts to be nice  
 "" you make me want to be a better man , "" he tells her  
one of the best aspects is that even as he opens up , he is still a curmudgeon  
carol , afraid that his monetary contribution to the wellness of her son hides a hidden agenda rushes over to his apartment in the rain to explain in no uncertain terms that she will never sleep with him  
it only takes her a second to realize that she is delivering that statement while looking as if she just left a wet t-shirt contest

geez , french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this ! 
sorry , non-british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders - my apologies  
the pair are british comediennes ( jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in "" absolutely fabulous "" ) , who did a series of film spoofs a few years back , including alien , the exorcist and misery  
needless to say , amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates ( the resemblance was quite uncanny ! ) , dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder's legs ! 
but despite the lingering memory of their sketch , and although i've now seen the film a couple of times now , that "" hobbling "" scene was no less disturbing ! 
i'm still left screaming at the telly in revulsion ! 
that may be the most memorable scene , but it's certainly not the only worth watching  
stephen king , whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality , strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale  
it's a nicely crafted psychological horror , which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon ( james caan )  
rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes ( bates ) , who introduces herself as the writer's "" number one fan "" , he soon becomes her prisoner  
both the script and kathy bates' beautifully masterful performance ( for which she won an oscar ) work arm-in-arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit-cake ( or is that fruity as a nut-cake ? )  
bates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece  
at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she's a rather tragic character , and more often than not she's just damned scary ! 
this is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity  
it's an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it's basically a two-hander , mainly set in one locale , it's a remarkable piece of cinema  
there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner's stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan  
oh , i haven't really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who's a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books )  
but , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show  
along with the pig , of course ! 
anyway , the tension is built-up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense  
there's the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve-shattering lengths to poison her wine  
he succeeds , but    she 
knocks the glass over ! 
i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well ! 
in the immortal words of homer j  simpson - "" d'oh ! ! "" 
other nerve-wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house  
we cut to annie in her car - she's on her way home    he 
realises this and tries to get back to his room    cut 
to the car again , she's getting near    will he make it ? 
ok , so these sequences aren't exactly original , nor perhaps unpredictable - but they work ! 
boy , do they work ! 
if a film has you on the edge of your couch , biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense , then it's doing something right ! 
of course , the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned "" hobbling "" ! 
annie realises her captive has been out of his room , and she's going to stop him once and for all  
cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer , and    i feel ill just thinking about it ! 
nasty  
it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand , and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho ! 
and then we're given one of the most ridiculously over-the-top fight scenes i've ever seen  
she gets hit over the head with a typewriter , set on fire , head smashed against the wall - and she just won't die ! 
sheldon isn't in terribly good shape either  
if it weren't so gorey it would almost be laughable  
but it's a terrifically effective film , and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked "
1,"probably the most popular and praised film of all time , turned out to be a primitive and predictable costume drama with a dose of social criticism  
everyone knows about the greatest and most famous shipping disaster of all time  
and the actual catastrophe is masterfully crafted by director james cameron , combining visual -and sound effects , he re-creates the frightening atmosphere of the sinking ship in the middle of nowhere  
i liked very much the emotional and brutal contrast between the first and the third classes  
while their cabin is slowly filling up with water , a mother is telling her children a fairytail -- ""   and 
they lived happily ever after   ""  
and then the ship goes down and the few survivors are left alone under the stars and the chilling air  
however , the actual disaster is happening almost at the end of the movie , while the first two hours are just beautiful sets and bad dialogues  
in the present day , the rms titanic is explored by brock lovett ( bill paxton ) , a treasure seeker looking for the coeur de la mer diamond , lost during the sinking  
somewhere inside the ship , lovett's crew discover a sketchbook of an artist long dead  
here , in the shape of a nude young lady , is a window into the distant age of 1912  
lovett is extremely surprised when he get's a phone call from rose dawson , claiming that she is a model  
she is immediately helicoptered onto the vessel , and she gets the first glimpse of the fated ship in 80 years  
as the memories come flooding back , she once again becomes rose dewitt buketer ( kate winslet ) , the fianc ? e of wealthy cal hockley ( billy zane ) and daughter of ruth dewitt bukater ( frances fisher )  
on board there are rich and poor , everyone trust in the ship's designer ( jonathan hyde ) and her master , captain e  j  
smith ( bernard hill )  
on board the ship , rose , unhappy and restless meets jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) - a young american artist , poor , brave and attractive  
a love story slowly emerges and the two lovers must not only experience the difference between the social classes , but also face the greatest power on earth - death  
cameron could as well have called his picture "" the never ending love "" or "" love at first sight "" , as he concentrates all his energy on the young couple , and not on the disaster itself  
the plot is anything but original and the dialogues sometimes resemble a television soap-opera  
the director doesn't even try to overcome his empty script  
because of its primitive and predictable plot , titanic is totally depending on the visuals that truly are breathtaking  
russel carpenter's rich , majestic and incredibly detailed cinematography is certainly award-worthy  
everything from art direction to visual and sound effects are a top notch  
but it doesn't help much when the costumes are more convincing than the actors who wear them  
the actors are not to blame , because their characters are more like caricatures , in other words - fake  
jack is a man with many talents : he is a talented artist , handsome , brave , honest , strong , funny    you 
name it  
he doesn't have any dark side , he doesn't make any mistakes , that for a second would make him human  
jack is perfect , but he is - poor  
on the other hand we have cal  
he is a bastard that treats rose as an odalisque and not as his wife-to-be  
he lacks everything jack possesses , but he is -- rich "
1,"there's good news and bad news about mulan  
the positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy-handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules  
on the other hand , the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs , several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast  
but mulan is a step in the right direction and disney's best animated feature since the lion king  
after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas , disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians  
mulan is set in feudal china and features the ever-popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married  
that's what we find out when young mulan ( voice of ming- na wen ) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her  
cartoons    
meanwhile , word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns  
since mulan's a girl , that means her decrepit old father must go  
she pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad , but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family  
that's chinese culture for you    
so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father's uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place  
the movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army  
it should have been called g  i  
chang  
mulan calls on her ancestors for help  
they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her , but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up  
voiced by eddie murphy , mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges  
murphy's performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin -- lots of wisecracks and ad-libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they're going to have  
you ain't never had a friend like mushu  
speaking of songs , mulan doesn't have too many of them , which is a plus with a story like this  
disney songs about war probably wouldn't go over too well ( "" heigh ho , heigh ho , it's off to war i go    "" ) , and the ones they do have aren't memorable  
the best of the bunch , sad to say , is "" be a man , "" the requisite basic training montage song  
yes , even in medieval china , they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle  
sung by donnie osmond ( a bad sign if ever there was one ) , "" be a man "" accompanies footage of mulan's platoon going from screw-ups to heroes  
it makes me wonder , has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that's ended badly ? 
i only wish real-life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage  
for the curious , mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl  
all she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulder-length , talk macho and slap guys on the butt , as was male custom a thousand years ago in china  
the deception fools everyone but the audience , who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12-year-old boy , at best  
but she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army , led by a big , evil-eyed attilla-looking monster "

1,"driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small , intimate story  
it's a quiet film , a slow film , a deliberate film  
but if you're patient with it , the movie offers innumerable rewards , such as a pair of self-assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy  
driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry's pulitzer-prize winning play of the same name , which first opened in new york four years ago  
the play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago , los angeles , london , vienna , norway , and the soviet union  
uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy ; he also penned the wonderful sleeper , mystic pizza  
the film , like the play , is set in atlanta , georgia , and it revolves around two people in their twilight years : a cranky , 70-something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60-something black man who becomes her chauffeur  
the movie relies on character , rather than plot , to propel the action  
in fact , the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense ; it doesn't present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together  
rather , driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life : shopping , listening to the radio , visiting the cemetery , eating fried chicken , and so on  
the film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta's history , including the 1958 bombing of the temple ( the city's oldest jewish congregation ) and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr  martin luther king , jr  
the story begins in 1948 with daisy ( tandy ) crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway  
the insurance company cancels her insurance , and her son , boolie , decides to hire her a chauffeur  
freeman , reprising his role from the play , plays the chauffeur , hoke  
the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger  
driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature , aging , prejudice , and a great many other things , but more than anything it's about a relationship : one that spans 25 years , 4 cars , the advent of civil rights , and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon  
daisy is strong-willed and set in her ways , and , from the outset , she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur  
initially , she treats hoke with contempt , refusing to let him drive her anywhere  
once she does get in the car , daisy is the ultimate back-seat driver  
to make matters worse , she is extremely self-conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand  
eventually , however , daisy is worn down by hoke's good-natured charm and infectious cheer ; she softens and opens up to him  
tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well , but unfortunately this feisty , cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace  
we've seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations , from on golden pond to cocoon  
nevertheless , tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own  
freeman , as hoke , on the other hand , gives the more distinctive of the two performances  
there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color  
hoke is uneducated and illiterate , but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man , an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior  
both freeman and tandy seem to be in their element , in full command of their natural charisma  
they flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves  
they bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie's gentle humor  
at the same time , tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama  
in his first dramatic role , dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie , tandy's loving and patient son  
drama seems to agree with aykroyd ; taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor , especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ( ghostbusters ii , the great outdoors , my stepmother is an alien )  
the only other significant characters in the film are daisy's housekeeper , idella , marvelously played by esther rolle ( "" good times "" ) , and boolie's pretentious wife , played by patti lupone  
under the direction of bruce beresford ( crimes of the heart , tender mercies ) , driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again  
but fortunately , beresford never forgets he's shooting a movie , and accordingly , he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches , such as gorgeous shots of flowers , trees , and tomatoes  
in adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen , the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety  
uhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say "

1,"city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most : thought-provoking , moving , and completely unsentimental  
i find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant , which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality  
city of angels is a wonderful film , enhanced by interesting and well-rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years  
it's a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story , and avoids most of the cliches we're so used to seeing in films like this  
city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders' 1988 film wings of desire  
i have yet to see wings of desire , so i am , unfortunately , unable to make a comparison of the two  
i have heard , however , that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways , which makes me glad that this film isn't a rip-off of its source material  
nicolas cage stars as seth , an angel who , like all of his angel counterparts , is present to lead the dying to heaven ( or somewhere just like it )  
one day , he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr  maggie rice ( meg ryan ) , and his attention is called to her  
the angels can make themselves seen to humans , but they can't experience any of the senses ( most importantly , touch )  
he shows himself to maggie , and she falls for him , unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status  
seth wants to become human so he can feel her  
that's when he meets nathaniel messinger ( dennis franz ) , "" former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race  "" 
 ( as a side note , i found messinger to be the most fascinating character , for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death  ) 
messinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human  
seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel ( i know , it sounds ridiculous , but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well-done ) ; after much deliberation , she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel  
this , of course , is when seth decides to take the plunge ( literally ) from a building ; when he wakes up from the fall , he is human , and happy to feel what it's like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead  
since i love this film so much , i'll make a minor note that it certainly isn't perfect  
although it is original and mesmerizing , it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre  
the plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic ( though the details are what make the story excellent , and steel has done a great job with them )  
the ending , too , could have been more powerful and less predictable  
these elements are minor , though , and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels  
the acting is superb from everyone involved  
this is perhaps my second-favorite performance from cage ( my favorite being the rock )  
he's quiet and pensive , and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly-toned words  
he's perfect for a role like this , and at the same time he reassures us he's not bound by playing the psycho ( though he is good at it , as he shows in face/off )  
meg ryan is a powerful , enticing , and appealingly-chirpy actress , and her work here is some of her best  
dennis franz , however , steals all of his scenes as the energetic former-angel  
what i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation  
director brad silberling is a talented man , and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters , rather than forced sentimentality  
his direction is steady , and he shows this in just about every scene : near the beginning , maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead  
there is no music or elaborate camera work ; we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information  
this is the way stories should be told , and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real  
the film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do  
cinematographer john seale ( the english patient ) provides some of the most stunning images i've seen on the big screen : hundreds of black-clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours ( just as an example )  
the music , by gabriel yared ( also of the english patient ) , is perfect for this film : it's quiet and moody music ( but not sentimental ! ) , and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely  
the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far  
all of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre "

1,"based on the relatively unknown ( in comparison to spider-man ) marvel comic book , blade tells the story of half-vampire half-human ( played by wesley snipes ) who was born of a vampire's latest meal  
now swearing vengeance against all vampires , blade hunts them all  
his latest challenge is his biggest though    he 
must stop the vampire deacon frost ( played by stephen dorff ) from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires  
admitedly , comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums , often viewed as juvenile by most standards , even seen as illiterate by some  
judging by a series of poorly recieved ( financial and critical ) comic book based films ( such as batman and robin , steel , barb wire , the crow : city of angels , and the list goes on ) , one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film  
to some degree , i agree with this sentiment  
having read comic books since the age of nine ( i'm 21 right now ) i can count the number of good comic book based movies ( not including japanese manga ) one hand : 1 : the crow ( 1994 ) , 2 : batman ( 1989 ) , 3 : superman , 4 : the mask , and now , #5 , blade  
 ( "" men in black "" is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book ) 
why is this ? 
for the most part , it is because the filmmakers understand 
the comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match  
the crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere , which the director provided  
the mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics , which the casting and cg effects reflect  
superman 
is not over the top with colour and flash , and the film reflects this  
blade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film , creating an appropriate atmosphere  
this is in stark contrast to joel schumacher's contrived vision in batman and robin , reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960's television show  
batman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact : comics have grown up , and so has the audience ( i'm working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when i'm ready )  
which brings me back to blade  
although he may be a familiar character to some , due to his appearances in the spider-man animated show on fox , one will find no single trace of the warm-and-fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon  
the film depicts a vicious vampire killer that 
uses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends  
the end results are not pretty by any means  
the story elements work very well -- for a comic book story  
screenwriter david goyer ( who also wrote the crow ) incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore , using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films  
this is presented through karen , a hematologist portrayed by n'bushe wright  
this leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires  
add this 
to the neat little gadgets that blade uses ( including a titanium sword complete with an "" anti-theft device "" ) , and one has an interesting premise  
however , the film works best as an action film  
actor wesley snipes has 
an extensive background in martial arts ( most of which comes from capoeira , a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks ) , choreographing every single move  
proving that quick , flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences ( see batman and robin for a 
good example of that ) , wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes  
regardless , this film is far from perfect  
the film suffers from at least one major plot hole , regarding the summoning of the blood god  
the ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are standing on 
marked squares , yet one of them is viciously murdered , allowing the ritual to pass ( and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square )  
obvious continuity errors also surface , especially during a scene where deacon frost takes a drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame ( there is no trace of smoke either )  
much of the special effects are not that spectacular either  
while vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch , other cgi ( computer generated imagery ) effects are almost slapped together , which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released ( the film's release date was pushed back multiple times )  
scenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake , knocking the believability factor down a few notches ( but then , i'm really hard to impress )  
the film's r rating comes from gory violence , but the lack of 
realism made me wonder why it got such a rating ( for realistic violence , 
watch "" saving private ryan "" )  
the overuse of cgi in films has made me yearn for the days of director george romero and makeup wizard rob bottin , both pioneers in the art of gore without extensive use of cgi  
still , scenes involving non-cgi special effects do surface ( and look much more impressive ) , such as one particularly gruesome scene where a vampire tries to use blade's sword without deactivating the "" anti-theft device "" "

1,"titanic is , without a doubt , the best movie i've seen all year  
and believe me , i'm not an easy critic to impress : the english patient was too long , men in black was over-hyped , and several of the "" big summer releases "" were dead in the water  
thank god this film got delayed until december  
it's my christmas present  
titanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years-gone-by , and it is truly a stunning film  
while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized , never taking your eyes off the screen , nor checking your watch to see how much longer it's gonna last , despite its 3 hour plus running time  
as a friend of mine , who's a true titanic-buff , said "" if someone doesn't like this film , it's because they didn't want to  "" 
truer words are hard to come by  
of course , it doesn't hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors , james cameron , who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time  
if you wish to argue that point with me , look at his list of credits : the terminator , aliens , the abyss , terminator 2 , true lies , etc  still care to disagree ? 
not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film , he also wrote , produced , and edited it  
and to show his true faith for the project , he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs  
it's obvious he truly loves titanic  
the film opens with footage , both real and fake , of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic , where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the "" heart of the ocean "" , which , according to bill paxton's character , would be worth more than the hope diamond today  
their search turns up , dissapointly , no diamond , but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond  
this picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose , who claims to be the girl in the picture  
she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond  
almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past  
rose's narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl , engaged to a rich man named cal hockley ( billy zane ) that she didn't want to marry  
her mother is pushy and obnoxious , and cal hockley is arrogant  
they are boarding the titanic , which is sailing to america , and this is where she is to marry cal  
meanwhile , a young man named jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) and his italian friend ( danny nucci ) win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game  
they are overjoyed , and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving  
for them , this is their ticket to america , to a better life  
for rose , she is sailing to her doom  
the first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt ( kate winslet ) and jack dawson fall in love  
it's the classic wrong-side-of-the-tracks story , and does sometimes resort to a few cliches  
but as i said above , the love portion isn't sappy and doesn't "" weigh the film down "" , as some critics have said  
it's sweet , and it didn't make me restless at all , despite the fact that i usually hate love stories  
of course , it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen  
most of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912 , including the enigmatic molly brown ( played by the talented kathy bates ) , the captain of titanic ( bernard hill ) , and so on  
all of these characters add an extra depth to the film , and make it that easier to watch  
of course , things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark , where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom  
the sinking is depicted realisticly , and the effects are truly amazing  
it is not told in a heroic fashion sense either , as people are portrayed as panicking , pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats , and drowning and dying horrible deaths  
the best part of the movie , in my opinion , comes at the very end , when we flash back to the future  
the crew , who at first had been skeptical of rose's story , now are totally aborbed by her  
rose goes out onto the ship's ledge , and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard  
we then see a dream of rose's , in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson "

1," "" when you get out of jail , you can kill him  "" 
starring ashley judd , tommy lee jones , bruce greenwood  
rated r  
double jeopardy is a lurid , prepostrous thriller that's also one of the year's most enjoyable  
it's an uncompromisingly brutal , cheerfully anarchic , hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it  
there is not a moment here when the events on screen don't have a direct bearing on the plot ; once the film gets going it never stops  
it has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and that's probably a correct assessment of the plot , but the film itself has little in common with the 1993 andrew davis/harrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones  
not even bothering with character introduction , director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the get-go and never finds the brake  
we meet , rather hastily , libby and nick parsons ( ashley judd and bruce greenwood , respectively ) a seemingly happy married couple , with a son matty , age 4  they go out on a sailboat one night , and after a period of some rockin' sex , they go to sleep  
libby hears a strange noise , wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood  
she follows a red trail to the upper deck , where she finds a knife and , out of astonishment , picks it up  
at that convenient moment , the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested  
her lawyer , a friend , puts up a defense in court , but though we know she is innocent , the evidence against her is too compelling  
her friend adopts her son and she goes to prison  
once in prison , she makes a phone call to her friend  
her friend gives her son the phone  
nick walks in the room  
little matty screams "" daddy ! "" 
the phone goes dead  
libby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isn't even dead  
she gets some advice from a prisoner/former lawyer , who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband , they can't convict her of the same crime again , meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they can't touch her  
after a weirdly short amount of time , she gets out of parole  
she is sent to live at a house with other recent parolees , under the command of parole officer travis lehman ( tommy lee jones )  
she sets out on a mission to find her husband and get her son back , which turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated  
she winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her son's "" adopter ""  
double jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false  
the law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime : same time , same place , same circumstances  
it's not like it matters  
this is a rollickingly good thriller ; intense , exciting , fast and furious  
it's silly alright , but this is the kind of film you just don't question  
in some films , plausibility is everything  
double jeopardy , however , is not concerned with making sense : its sole purpose is to entertain , and it does  
judd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role  
this is her breakout box-office performance , and she is terrific  
she brings some emotion to what could have been a one-dimensional role , giving the movie a little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set pieces  
tommy lee jones basically just reprises the role for which he won an oscar in the fugitive , but the movie makes good use of his stone-faced wit  
thankfully , too , double jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby and travis ; a subplot which doubtlessly would have interfered with the film's story  
this is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys , and i took a sort of sick pleasure in that  
the sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful , as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book "
1,"george little ( jonathan lipnicki ) wants a little brother  
after mr  and mrs  little ( hugh laurie and geena davis ) visit the orphange , they decide to adopt stuart , a talking mouse ( voiced by michael j  fox )  
george isn't so fond of his new brother when stuart arrives at the little house , and neither is snowbell the family cat ( voiced by nathan lane )  
george and stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race , but snowbell wants stuart out of the house ( he's unable to live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying it's ridiculous that a mouse has a pet cat )  
stuart little is a mix of live action and computer generated imagery ( cgi )  
the character of stuart , while obviously a computer generated image , grows on you as the film progresses and you'll soon see him as much more than a mere special effect  
there is also a great deal of animal training involved with this film , as many of the "" supporting cast "" are actual cats ( with computer animated mouths so they can speak )  
it's fascinating to watch these cats give performances without an actual mouse to interact with  
stuart little is a charming family film  
there are some great laughs in the movie ( with a script co-written by the sixth sense's m  night shyamalan no less ! ) , 
some moments that can only be described as "" too cute "" ( the boat race sequence is what won me over ) and even the majority of the one-liners ( common nowadays in children's films or films featuring nathan lane ) are tolerable  
kids and parents will love this one  
stuart little is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video  
there are two different dvds on sale : one contains the film in full frame , and the other presents the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1  66 : 1  
both versions feature choices of either dolby surround or dolby digital 5  1 audio  
both versions also contain the following extras ( and hang in there with me here    there's a lot of them ) : a full length audio commentary track by director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson , a full length audio commentary track by the visual effects supervisors , an isolated score track , an interactive trivia game , an interactive featurette that goes step by step through eight of the effects in the film , a making of documentary that originally aried on hbo , and a stuart little read-along story ( which you can read yourself or have stuart read for you )  
there are also three music videos , and six theatrical trailers ( called thecatrical trailers    
get it ? 
it's funny ! ) for stuart little and five other columbia tristar releases : the adventures of elmo in grouchland , madeline , the nuttiest nutcracker , muppets from space , and baby geniuses ( the only bad thing about this entire dvd    
i did not want to be reminded of the awfulness that is baby geniuses )  
dvd-rom features are also on the disc , including web links and a demo of the stuart little cd-rom game  
but wait    
there's still more ! 
there's a section called "" basement treasures "" where you will find the auditions of the film's animators , six deleted scenes which you can select to view with or without commentary from the director , a visual effects gag reel , a production gag reel , and an incredible eight minute storyboard sequence detailing the original concept for the boat race scene ( with commentary from the director )  
the first commentary track features director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson  
they give insightful and detailed thoughts about the film's production  
minkoff likes to point out scenes where other screenwriters came in and polished up the script , namely writers like scott alexander and larry karaszewski ( who wrote the people vs "
1," "" you'll go ape over tarzan because it's more fun than a barrel of monkeys ! "" 
okay , there's the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie  
disney's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship  
father , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson  
it's amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack  
before you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard  
against the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own  
tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild  
much of tarzan's young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his "" father , "" which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his attempts  
all he's looking for is acceptance , perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers , but one which will ring true with a lot of adults  
when you really think about it , this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end  
look back on past disney animated features and you'll see the trend  
growing up , tarzan ( voiced by alex d  linz as a child , and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends  
one is an ape named terk ( rosie o'donnell ) , and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight )  
both provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold  
i'm beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films  
just fill in the blanks ! 
can you see it ? 
 "" now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it  
we've already had a fish and a crab , and we've had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues     have 
we had an ape and an elephant yet ? 
well , there we go ! "" 
of course , there's gotta be romance somewhere along the line , so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through  
together with her father dr  porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa  
she discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately , and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory "" you tarzan , me jane "" scene  
thankfully , those aren't the exact words  
however , i found it distracting that tarzan is going "" ohh ohh ee ee "" one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction  
how does he tell his name to another ape ? 
 "" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? "" 
well , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable  
but hey , tarzan's a young adult  
do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ? 
isn't that illegal in most countries ? 
oh , well  
i don't think disney will be using my quote anymore  
tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical  
there's lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time  
we instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material  
this isn't really a bad thing , as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it's just different  
do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie  
with each new feature , disney animation gets even better  
not necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan  
there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying "

1,"in the wake of the smashing success of "" rumble in the bronx , "" it's looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release  
rumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii  
the version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it's widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days  
availability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng  
the subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small  
although the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you're reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it  
to be fair , i must admit that i've never been very fond of "" period-piece "" martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past  
perhaps it's because most of those i've seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it's because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant  
in fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end  
or , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc  ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts  
having said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i've seen , and i quite enjoyed it  
surprised ? 
well , so was i  
drunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu  
where he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong's practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu  
apparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i've heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i'll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better  
one of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the "" once upon a time in china "" movies , but i have not yet seen those  
the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you're watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren't expecting something on the order of "" war and peace ""  
the story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china's cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill  
however , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong's perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs  
the macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners  
in the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer  
in the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng  
after fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general's son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng  
and so it goes  
and the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong's girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i've already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves  
let's move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies    the 
action  
there's plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie    of 
course , in a kung fu film , that's to be expected  
however , this isn't just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius  
the primary martial arts "" style "" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk  
further , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated   "

1,"warning : this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film "" fail-safe  "" 
if you haven't seen the film yet , proceed with caution  
nutshell : a relevant , intelligent , suspenseful drama  
still powerful today , even after the end of the cold war  
-------------------- "" fail-safe "" ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes 
screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e  youngstein directed by sidney lumet 
review by jamahl epsicokhan -------------------- 
the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn't have a winning side and a losing side  
in a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world--assuming the world survives  
the idea--and perhaps the only real option--is to avoid war at all costs  
this is the theme of sidney lumet's "" fail-safe , "" a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler  
 "" fail-safe "" takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism  
the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws  
five u  s  bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america  
the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers  
suddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike  
a great deal of "" fail-safe "" 's plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u  s  bombers from reaching russia's borders--at any cost  
the plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios  
the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails  
general bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable  
the events in "" fail-safe "" are fascinating because they're anything but predictable , but the real reason "" fail-safe "" works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot  
a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states' role in all of it  
most of this is through the film's use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president's advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war  
many of the film's most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices  
early in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of "" strategy "" in a nuclear assault to "" minimize "" casualties  
 "" what's the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? "" 
a guest asks impatiently  
 "" forty million , "" groeteschele responds wryly  
the problem with groeteschele's mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war  
the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals  
groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over  
yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o'herlihy ) has often recommended  
on the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u  s  , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage  
such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race  
 "" fail-safe "" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film  
why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ? 
is it wise ? 
is it even logical ? 
no , not really "

1,"in october of 1962 the united states found itself on the brink of nuclear holocaust when u2 spy plane fly-overs of cuba revealed that the soviet union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles 90 miles from the us  
president john kennedy ( bruce greenwood ) and his staff must face this major threat to world peace and stop soviet expansionism in director roger donaldson's dramatic recreation of the most dangerous crisis in american history in "" thirteen days  "" 
one of the highlights to come out of made-for-tv movies was a 1974 entry called "" missiles of october "" that also recreated the historic event that almost embroiled the us , ussr and the world in an all out nuclear showdown  
that teleplay , starring william devane and martin sheen as john and bobby , showed the political tensions of the period that brought to the fore the danger the world faced in those two weeks in 1962  
now , a quarter of a century after the landmark tv movie , director roger donaldson and producer kevin costner team together again ( the last time was for the taught spy thriller "" no way out "" ) to re-enact the events of that most dangerous time in america's and the world's history  
taken from the viewpoint of special assistant to the president kenneth p  o'donnell ( costner ) , donaldson and crew recreate that volatile event , once again , as the country is plunged into what could have been total nuclear war  
as o'donnell gets ready to head to work one october morning , he deals with the usual family crises and problems  
meanwhile , a u2 spy plane photo mission over cuba has produced some startling images - medium range nuclear missiles in the first stage of deployment  
suddenly , ken's routine day switches into crisis mode as the president and his key advisor bobby begin to muster the considerable forces of the us military to face the soviet threat  
where "" thirteen days "" differs most from "" missiles of october "" is , as expected , in the scope of the project  
there is a big difference , budget-wise , between making a television docudrama and one that goes to the big screen  
it shows as the makers of "" thirteen days "" craft a recreation of the cuban missile crisis that encompasses not only the political intrigue within the white house , it also depicts the events that took place as america girds itself for nuclear confrontation  
the cast , a true ensemble , is led , surprisingly , by bruce greenwood as jfk and not by kevin costner  
costner's o'donnell represents the family guy thing as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him and his family  
this puts a personal spin on the film as we see both the crisis and america's preparation for war and the pressure it brings to bear on those in the know  
kenny reassures his wife and kids that all will be okay and they will be safe , but he knows that , if the crisis comes to a head , his family will be no more  
the meat of "" thirteen days "" is in the big picture , not the microcosm of family , though  
this is where the film stands out as we see the workings of our government on the highest levels  
the story does not just cover the face-off between the world's two most powerful countries ; it also depicts the animosity between the president and the military/cia  
the disaster of the bay of pigs invasion the year before left a distrustful taste in the mouths of the generals and admirals who blame the kennedys for not backing the cuban expatriates fighting fidel castro  
the missile crisis becomes a struggle for power as the army/navy/air force want to flex their might and invade cuba , while jfk wants to end the confrontation peaceably but with america's dignity and world leadership intact  
while the internal battle for power rages in the white house , with air force chief curtis lemay ( kevin conway ) advising the president to bomb cuba into the stone age , our armed forces are set into motion to stop the soviets with a blockade of offensive weapons to cuba  
this is where the political intrigues of high office are replaced by exciting action  
when the first confrontation takes place between a us warship and a soviet freighter , the tension is palpable  
the most involving action sequence takes place late in the game as another u2 is sent up to shoot some snaps of the buildup and the fully prepared soviet forces launch an anti-aircraft attack on the hapless pilot of the spy plane  
this is a sweaty palm sequence to say the least , making you squirm in your seat as you try to help the pilot avoid those missiles  
the ensemble cast places greenwood as the first among equals with like weight given to all the principle players  
greenwood does not play act at being a caricature of jfk , foregoing the typical kennedy boston accent  
instead , he plays the man as a powerful figure who has to maintain the dignity of the office , directing his subordinates but giving them the latitude to make clear all of his options  
kennedy used this decision by committee method to good effect as his senior staff uncovers all the options available to the president  
costner , as ken o'donnell , is really a supporting cast member as a kennedy crony brought on board as a personal political favor  
costner plays o'donnell as if he crammed on old jfk speeches with a forced kennedyesque twang to his speech  
the rest of the players are first rate from start to finish with steven culp looking and sounding just like robert kennedy  
the rest of the familiar players in this drama are uniformly well cast , too  
standing out are michael fairman as the beleaguered us ambassador to the un , adlai stevenson , who was forced to become the challenging voice of the united states in the united nations and i remember the confrontation vividly  
the filmmakers capture the accusations laid down by stevenson with accuracy , using old style video footage to good effect  
dylan baker has the look and feel of the intelligentsia as the brainy secretary of defense robert mcnamara  
kevin conway gives his general lemay the right "" bomb them to hell "" attitude "

1,"the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages  
martin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime  
unfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies  
seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime  
this film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s  
goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film )  
the book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york  
at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands  
after couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro )  
three of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history  
wealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business  
but the perfect world of "" wiseguys "" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends  
goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory  
scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker  
world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating  
scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny  
after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens  
scorsese also manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience  
with the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character's dialogue or narrator's commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era  
even if we don't pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker  
first , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie's ironic prologue  
then , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards  
this multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation  
same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack  
nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s  
but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed  
however , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people  
such scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s  
fragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn't have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese  
he uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious "" a day in life "" segment near the end of the film  
another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents  
the most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues  
joe pesci deserved his "" oscar "" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film  
ray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn't look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film  
liotta's henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs  
liotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction  
lorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband  
paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave  
as a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time "

his 1998 film cure , with one of his niftiest ideas , is just now getting a sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with  
cure is probably his classic  
last year he released seance , a remake of seance on a wet afternoon  
that was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into a non-supernatural story  
pulse is kurosawa back on form  
taguchi , a young computer expert , is late with his delivery of some important software  
two co-workers go to his apartment and find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment  
taguchi , acting very strangely , lets his friends look for the missing software  
meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain  
when he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself  
if that was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange dark mildew-like spot on the wall  
taguchi's computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus  
people whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide  
but they are not entirely dead  
their spirits seem to remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet  
people who get the computer virus are asked if they want to see a ghost  
if they say yes , they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow  
the computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist  
this is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing "" like a computer disk  "" 
instead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses  
there is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers  
leave it to kurosawa to find a new kind of death  
this is a film that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the film all work  
it may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to death , but whatever it does convey is nightmarish  
kurosawa , who directs his own screenplay , ties his story into the real world with some familiar and accurate computer discussion  
frequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact  
his plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange  
junichiro hayashi , the cinematographer who recently has been doing all of kurosawa's films , creates a dark , cold , and gloomy tone  
images are obscured by semi-lighting or are behind plastic curtain  
scenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might "
1,"director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one )  
film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story , but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something  
but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story  
so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential , the film almost automatically deserves a good review  
and when they add a fascinating story to it , you have nearly perfect entertainment  
fincher's the game is no exception to this  
the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time  
fincher hasn't made a film since "" seven , "" his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever  
so it is about time he made another film  
and what a ride it is  
the game isn't quite as powerful as "" seven , "" but in some ways it is better  
overall , the game could have used a little more clarity , or a little more uncertainty  
it walks a line of insanity and reality , but it never goes either way until the very end  
the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events , and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight  
unfortunately , unlike "" the usual suspects , "" we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening , whether it be true or false  
however , this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent  
the game is told completely from its main character's point of view  
nicholas van orton ( michael douglas ) is a high-strung and isolated businessman  
he lives alone in his giant mansion , divorced from his wife elizabeth , and is celebrating his 48th birthday ; the same age at which his father committed suicide at , in the same mansion  
for his 48th birthday , conrad ( sean penn ) , the rebel of the family , gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs : consumer recreation services  
 "" it will make your life fun again , "" his brother promises  
as skeptical as nicholas is , he is somewhat intrigued , and annoyed by the lack of information--something this businessman hates  
seeing a billboard in an office , he decides to visit the mysterious company  
jim feingold ( james rebhorn ) greets nicholas and guides him through the sign-up process , which consists of psych-tests , physicals , emotional responses , and other mind games  
 "" each game is suited to each person's emotional and psychological needs , "" explains feingold  
one day , nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests  
even more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up , he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company  
what he doesn't realize is that the game has already begun  
the phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas' way  
how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive  
the detail involved in fincher's shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them  
with "" seven , "" fincher had almost every single shot mean something  
he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to  
compared to "" seven , "" though , the game is light and comical  
because of this film's sense of humor and self-awareness , nothing can be taken quite seriously  
so don't try to make much sense of what goes on in the game , because it doesn't want you to  
what does make sense is the final revelation--when everything becomes apparent and clear  
if taken as it is , the game's ending makes complete sense  
but if you try and critique every minute detail , then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility "
1,"a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal  
a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another  
a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain  
a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end  
if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues  
it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label  
edward zwick's the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states  
you'd think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines  
arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u  s  responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack  
however , unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden's camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal  
in retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world  
unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau's new york office at one federal plaza  
while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information  
generally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u  s  , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm  
even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country  
hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government  
the original tagline for patriot games was , "" there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil  "" 
however true , it was pulled before the movie's release because it sounded too much like a dare  
revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america  
admittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who's going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two-thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid  
i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare of good guy g-men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order  
it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab-american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself  
in fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk  
although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups  
throughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully  
what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides  
it actually gets rather heady at times , but it's a credit to screenwriters zwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they don't underestimate the intelligence of the audience  
i don't know if it's his tone or inflection or something else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great  
this , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid-level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable  
annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i've seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable  
it's somewhat unfortunate that her character's fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range  
bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough-guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face  
however , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film's development  
notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant  
the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society "

1,"there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review , not because of their own complexity , but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original  
one of such masterpieces is casablanca , probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art , but definitely the most popular one  
its popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere , but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day  
casablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience  
one of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail , at least judging by conventional movie-making wisdom of its time  
it was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn't been produced on stage ; screenplay by three writers - julius g  epstein , philip j  epstein and howard koch - was beeing written as shooting went along ; the main actors were producers' second choice , and , finally , man behind camera , michael curtiz was considered to be capable , but not great director  
however , the movie was commercially successful and earned three "" oscars "" , including the one for the best film  
until this very day , it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film- making in its own golden age  
the plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda , yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story  
in december 1941 , casablanca , exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral , yet nazi-collaborating french vichy government  
thousands of refugees from war-torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america , and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas  
many shady characters thrive on their misery , including the corrupt police chief , captain renault ( rains )  
his best friend is rick blaine ( bogart ) , who used to be idealistic anti-fascist , and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of "" sticking his neck for nobody ""  
however , everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas  
this event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca  
one of them is victor laszlo ( henreid ) , czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe  
he is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund ( bergman ) , with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris  
the couple needs visas , especially because of the gestapo major strasser ( veidt ) being on their trail  
rick is now forced to choose between love , wounded pride , self-preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism  
the casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration - humphrey bogart , most legendary actor in the history of cinema , is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status  
bogart's portrayal of rick as complicated man , torn between idealistic past and bitter present , was so perfect , that his icon would forever be connected with that character  
another icon in his company is ingrid bergman , great actress of old hollywood , here in her artistic and visual prime  
the cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking - some happier times when the romance on the screen didn't look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works  
for many people , casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made  
but the reason for that isn't the romance itself - it's the realistic story of people forced to make tough , and often wrong choices in their life  
the casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads  
the supporting actors also did a marvellous job  
sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic - john huston's maltese falcon ; yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters  
another shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle ; character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny  
unfortunately , the charisma that burdened laszlo , leaves little place for difficult choice , making his character forever overshadowed by rick/ilsa coupling  
however , rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca  
captain renault , brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a lifetime , was embodiment of perfect , almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm  
despite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie , rains managed to make renault sympathetic character , and his final conversion to the side of good , symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary  
rains also gave another dimension to the movie , making it even more ambiguous ; people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renault's relationship towards rick , and rick's final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations  
together with well-drawn characters and exciting story , the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere  
professional nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies , but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww2 movie that is beliavable , if not realistic  
any way , even if we don't see it as a historical document , casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration "

1,"hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death ( no pun intended - honest )  
it's a shame , too , because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b-movie monsters  
i mean , come on  
are people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour ? 
hell no  
and not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell , but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well , not commonly associated with horror films  
and not only has the idea been done too many times , but with the possible exception of from dusk 'till dawn , has not been done very well lately , either  
this is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu  
i got to go back to the times when making movies ( even horror movies ) was considered an art form , and not just done to make cash like nowadays  
and that is exactly what this film is ; art  
i've been a horror fan since i was eight years old , and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers  
let me backtrack a minute  
when i say "" intellectual ground "" , i don't mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that , i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to , a little bit of thinking is involved  
with most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what-not , you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown  
those movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit ; movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen  
you see , this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore  
this is a thinking man's slasher flick  
the "" nosferatu "" of the title is orlock ( max shreck ) , a strange , hermit-like count that , as the film opens , is looking for a new home to buy  
he employs the help of hutter ( gustav von wangenhein ) , a real estate salesman ( or something to that effect ) who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen ( greta schroeder )  
upon orders from his boss , hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlock's castle and speak to him about his new home ( which just happens to be right next door to hutter's )  
the next morning , he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck    not 
really a good sign  
he then discovers through some reading that the count is a "" nosferatu "" , or vampire , one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans  
but by the time he pieces this together , he is too late ; orlock has already embarked to hutter's hometown via boat  
will hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock ? 
the character of orlock is , of course , dracula  
the only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strocker's novel  
just thought that was an interesting little side note    
probably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainment's digitally restored cut , now available in stores  
however , this version is quite different than maunau's original masterpiece  
the movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band type o-negative and color tinting , much like the 1984 version of lang's metropolis  
now , i really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying to do here , bringing a classic like this to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one  
but alas , i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen  
but that's just my bag ; you may like the newer , more "" modern "" version better  
either way , i suggest investing your money in a copy  
if you like what they have done with it , pop it in the vcr and enjoy  
if you're like me , just do what i'll do during future viewings ; turn the color all the way down on your television , hit mute , turn on some bach or mozart or whatever , dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made "

1,"roman emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) chooses his trusted general maximus ( russell crowe ) as his successor  
however the emperor's evil son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) murders his father before the announcement can be made , and maximus ( as well as his family ) is sentenced to be executed  
maximus is able to escape his executioners , but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo ( oliver reed )  
proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money ( he being a former gladiator himself ) , and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator  
when emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum , proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle  
maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus  
gladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania , and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required "" 40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence "" style of moviemaking  
the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used    
it's choppy slow-motion which is unsettling and distracting  
it's similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan , but nowhere near as effective  
the actual gladiator battles are thrilling , but also a bit disjointed  
many times it's unclear as to exactly what's going on    
all the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled  
we're not sure who's blood or by who's hand though  
there's an instance of this earlier in the film too that's disappointing  
it's comes when maximus escapes his executioners  
some flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free    
but i still don't know exactly how he did it  
russell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995's virtuosity  
for whatever reason his stardom never arrived    
but he should have it now  
from here on moviegoers should now be able to say , "" let's go see the new russell crowe movie ""  
he gets the best scene in the film ( and one of the best moments of all recent movies ) when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum  
it's both rousing and chilling  
joaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person and not just a cartoon character ( which could have easily happened )  
commodus is conniving , sneaky and whiny , but phoenix never lets the character get silly  
it's a very good ( and very creepy ) performance  
oliver reed died during the filming of gladiator , and it's a huge loss to the acting world  
i've always been fascinated with reed   "
1,"i didn't realize how apt the name of this movie was until i called the mpaa ( the motion picture association of america - the folks who decide what's g , nc 17 , pg , r or x ) to ask why the preview was rated r  so that we can make some sense of their response , let me tell you about the movie itself  
 "" the celluloid closet "" is a documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades  
it's brilliant , funny , naughty and extremely poignant  
it tore at my heart to watch a gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that , as a rule , gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen  
regardless of how veiled - or how sordid - the presence of a gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation and makes them feel as if they're not quite so invisible as america seems to want them to be  
the movie itself is rated r - and for good reason  
it contains scenes of bloody , violent gay bashing and graphic , uninhibited , sex  
as with any movie , i appreciate knowing about these things ahead of time , so i can decide for myself whether to see the movie with a friend , a date , my 11 year old niece , alone or not at all  
but , that's the movie  
now back to the preview  
prior to this film being theatrically released ( it was originally filmed as a documentary for hbo ) i had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times  
there was no nudity , no violence , no bad language , nothing that i could see that would be offensive or inappropriate for a general audience ( okay , whoopi goldberg did refer to someone "" boning "" someone , but the last i knew that wasn't one of the seven words you can't say on tv )  
except for a scene of two fully clothed men kissing  
hmmmmm  
when i inquired about the rating on the trailer , a very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from "" the handbook "" that a trailer approved for all audiences could contain "" no homosexuality or lesbianism and no going down on someone  "" 
hello ? i was in the office and it was the middle of the day  
bravely , i pursued  
 "" i've seen that trailer , oh    
probably half a dozen times , "" i gulped    
 "" and i don't remember that scene  "" 
 "" well , "" she chirped  
 "" it's there  
our little eyes are trained to see that  "" 
no really  
in the words of dave barry , "" i am not making this up  "" 
they are "" trained "" to "" see that ? "" 
when someone who was shocked at the rating the first time and made a note to watch it carefully the following five times or so managed to let it slip past her ? 
gosh , i certainly don't mean to question the mpaa , or "" the handbook ""  
i would , however , like to suggest that it's they who are in the closet on this one  
and the light ain't good in there  
but , having seen "" the celluloid closet , "" and being one of a handful of straight people involved in a primarily gay and lesbian weekly bible study ( email me and i'll give you the details ) , none of this was any big surprise  
the point of the movie was that homosexuality , even in the politically correct 90s , is ridiculously perceived as a threat to a mostly heterosexual society  
a point well made in this candid and honest film  
now , i could go off on the mpaa's ruling that a trailer must contain "" no homosexuality or lesbianism "" and ask how that is defined , particularly in light of some of the things , both sexual and non-sexual , that i've watched straight people do in trailers  
i just don't feel the need to go there , because it seems so obvious  
i'll instead suggest that the mpaa re-evaluated their evaluation criteria "

will they turn themselves in ? 
all of these questions were running through my mind while watching this slick suspense film  
the events in the curve are very surprising , original , and fun  
the plot sounds much like dead man on campus , but that is not the deal with this film  
this film is a very serious one , with not many laughs  
there are many twists and turns that make this film different from most films  
the ending in particular is completely unpredictable and satisfying  
it is a terrific , suspenseful ending that i could never predict would happen  
hands down to dan rosen who wrote this wild ride  
the sound really stood out in the film  
it is quite eerie and it really adds to the feel of the film  
the way the movie is filmed is also great  
all of the technical aspects , as well as the acting and directing aspects are very well done  
the performances in the curve are very good  
matthew lillard gets to play another creepy role , just like in 1996's scream  
 ( a+ ) he is very strange in this film as well  
i like him in this sort of role , rather than the roles he has been playing in comedies such as senseless and she's all that "
1,"i have a soft spot in my heart for pure , amoral sleaze  
i liked showgirls ( there , i said it )  
i typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz , sex-filled cinematic tabloid-ish trash  
wild things is the best sleazy film i've ever seen  
it's filled with great performances , graphic sex , three-way sex , rape charges , double-crosses , plot twists , genitalia of all genders , graphic violence , death , witty humor , and , best of all , denise richards  
criticizing this film for being disgusting , raucous , and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing , or titanic for being lofty and epic  
wild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors , but i don't just admire it for this--i admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the movies  
i must admit up-front , however , that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal  
i imagine that this shows  
it's hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn't be known  
i thought i had the whole thing worked out from the trailer , but i was wrong ; there are a lot of turns here  
i'll just say that the film takes place in blue bay , a rich little town in florida  
in blue bay lives sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students , kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , and suzie toller ( neve campbell )  
kelly's mother , sandra ( theresa russell ) , immediately presses charges  
all of this happens fairly early in the film  
and right up until this point , i had the whole film predicted  
i was wrong , though , and every time i was proven wrong , i was shocked  
wild things isn't even remotely plausible , but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless , and often invited , just for kicks  
i remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers  
i'd give the preview four stars  
it made me want to see the movie so much that i've been waiting for it anxiously ever since  
over the past few weeks though , i started to realize that there was no way the film could live up to the preview ( see independence day ) ; thankfully , i was proven wrong  
the preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution company : not only does it make us want to see the film , but it doesn't give away any of the secrets  
but i'm not here to talk about the preview  
i'm here to talk about denise richards  
now , i found her mildly interesting in starship troopers , but in wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene she's in demands attention in a way that almost no other performer can  
of course , this might have something to do with her oceanic eyes    and 
flawless body    but 
i thought she did a great job acting , too ( stop laughing )  
no , richards is truly a find--she is talented , and always convincing in this film  
this mixed in with her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace in the future  
the other actors are good , too  
dillon is as suave as ever ( it's nice to see him bouncing back from albino alligator and in & out )  
bacon does a good job acting all determined and stuff as a sex crimes officer  
neve campbell gives the most layered performance of all of them , though i won't pretend that any of these characters are deep and complex "
1,
1,"as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it , the more pleased i was when i left  
first , getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz : "" if you liked scream , you'll love wild things ! "" 
 "" campbell gives a stunning performance ! "" 
 "" this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days ! "" 
 ( oh yeah , the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me ) 
now , onto more serious stuff ( and with this film , i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way )  
wild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa  
i'm not saying that in a bad way , but when you see this film , you may be shocked by what you see  
however , perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film's charming cast and tricky plot , that they let the film slide with an r rating  
being mormon , i'm bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film  
trouble is , i have already seen it  
and i like it ! 
wild things is a film noir of the 90s , filled with 40s sensibilities , and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture  
the style in which it is filmed is rich in color  
the actors are all gorgeous people , seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film  
sure , it's all too good to be true , but ain't it fun to watch ? 
when movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it  
there will be people who don't want to admit liking what they see , but i tell you , most anyone who sees this will like it  
wild things begins at blue bay high school , the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into  
it's almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone )  
of course , there are those select few who may look slightly ugly , but compared to the average person , they are gorgeous  
immediately , the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time  
we can turn off our brains , right ? 
wrong  
while you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn't turn out that way  
the film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present  
there's sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students  
he's heading the class discussion  
there's also kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam  
teaching the class , however , are two policemen : ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) , who want to talk about 'sex    
 ( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) '  
 "" what is a sex crime ? "" 
ray asks  
 "" not gettin' any ! "" 
one student responds  
this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch  
however , upon hearing this , one student , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , stands up and leaves the room , commenting that they can both kiss part of her body  
and so , wild things sets into motion  
quickly , kelly begins hitting on sam , but sam doesn't want anything to do with her advances  
kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him  
she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep  
surprisingly , that's really all i can tell you about the plot  
any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists  
and what's more , these plot twists are actually unpredictable  
going along the way of scream , wild things maintains that film's surprises , and then adds even more to them  
there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen "
1," "" jaws "" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen  
the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds  
then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score  
dah-dum  
from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly  
right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once "" jaws "" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip  
perhaps what is most outstanding about "" jaws "" is how spielberg builds the movie  
he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act  
unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act  
until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music  
he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying  
he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery  
the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years  
the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money  
brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute  
hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( "" it's a perfect engine , an eating machine "" ) make it that much more terrifying  
when vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark  
the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it  
 "" jaws "" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror  
it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by "" star wars "" )  
even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's "" psycho , "" and it never seems to age  
although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill  
the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects  
scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time "" jaws "" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman  
nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark  
scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town  
 "" it's your first summer here , you know , "" mayor vaughn warns him  
dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in "" american graffiti "" ( 1973 ) and "" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz "" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers  
however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards  
bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism  
he's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature  
however , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars  
quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u  s  s  
indianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese  
his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen  
shaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film  
of course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature "

1,"when quentin tarantino made "" pulp fiction "" , he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s ; he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time  
but before you send me hate-mail for not giving that title to "" citizen kane "" , hear me out  
much like "" citizen kane "" , "" pulp fiction "" has changed movie making forever  
but i think the latter has had a tad more impact  
 "" pulp fiction "" has actually ushered in a new era of film making  
it has altered the way films will be viewed  
 "" fiction "" has spawned so many imitations , i've lost count  
sure , some have been excellent ( "" bound "" and "" the usual suspects "" spring immediately to mind ) , but any serious movie-goer recognizes "" pulp fiction "" as the original neo-noir of the 90s  
in this review , i hope to change all the people's minds who have criticized it for it's excessive profanity and violence ( which , by the way , isn't really that graphic )  
the most brilliant aspect of tarantino's masterpiece is the screenplay  
it is filled with so much classic dialogue ( the "" quarter pounder with cheese "" speech will go down in history ) , it should be required reading for any film student , if it isn't already  
the story ( told in unorthodox non-linear format ) centers around three main episodes , all of which eventually intertwine  
the first , titled "" vincent vega and marcellus wallace's wife "" , deals with a very loaded john travolta ( i forgot to mention the cool heroin shoot-up sequence ) taking mia wallace ( a star-making performance by uma thurman ) , his bosses wife , out on a date to a cool 50s restaurant called jack rabbit slim's  
they talk for a while ( with the occasional "" uncomfortable silence "" ) , mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror  
after giving marcellus' new bride a foot massage , he was thrown off a building and into a greenhouse , giving him a "" speech impediment ""  
they also partake in a cool dance contest and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic "" you never can tell ""  
i won't reveal the rest of the story , but i'll definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night , despite the cool trophy they win  
the second story ( the least of the three but still four stars ) stars bruce willis ( proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the "" die hard "" flicks ) as boxer butch coolidge  
previously in the film ( like i said , it's told in non-linear form ) , he had made a deal with marcellus wallace that he would take a fall in a match  
as it turns out , he not only doesn't take the fall , but he ends up actually killing his opponent  
he takes a cab to his half-witted girlfriend's apartment , and to make a long story short , ends up going back to his own place to retrieve a gold watch , sort of a family heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flash-back sequence  
on his way home , he bumps into ( literally ) marcellus  
the two winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers , which results in the infamous "" gimp "" scene , which is very reminicent of the "" squeal like a pig ! "" 
scene from "" deliverance ""  
the last ( and best , in my opinion ) of the episodes features john travolta ( again ) and samuel l  jackson ( in the best performance of any supporting actor ever ) as two slightly off-kilter hitmen trying to rid themselves of a bloody car  
they seek help with a friend of jackson's ( played by the q-man himself ) , desperately in need of a stress ball  
they end up calling a "" cleaner "" of sorts , played by the god among men harvey keitel , to help them out  
in the end , the story brilliantly loops around itself , actually ending where it began  
if you haven't already seen the film ( or even if you have , for that matter ) , i suggest you invest your money in a copy of the letterbox collectors edition  
it features two previously unreleased scenes and the original film restored how it was originally meant to be seen  
earlier today , i bought this version and watched it a few hours ago  
what the pan-and-scan did to this movie is inexcusable  
that version cut out , like , half the movie  
what i have missed in the past years of viewing this flick is amazing  
for instance , when travolta and jackson are in the apartment near the end , the widescreen version allows you to see that several things on the walls make crosses  
this might help explain the divine intervention that takes place  
just a theory   "
1,"linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogma's lead is nothing short of inexplicable  
she's still in fine form as bethany , an abortion clinic worker who's lost her faith  
one night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany's bedroom  
he is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god , and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-the fate of the universe depends on it  
god would do it him/herself , but he/she is    missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again  
bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the "" prophets "" jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double-duty ) , the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith's films thus far  
at some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and very black ) "" thirteenth apostle "" , and offers his assistance , as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek )  
it's a wild ride  
they're in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck , respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been ) , who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return  
loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates  
at one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets  
it's a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks , "" how corrupt are you ? ""  
wings of desire this ain't  
since debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors  
 ( chris rock is this film's only weak link-between jokes , he's wooden  ) 
his no-frills visual style hasn't changed much over the years , though ( dogma's widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another  
dogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition  
as well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever  
any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogma's pacing goes slack  
a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we've heard enough  
because his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki's bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time  
sure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated  
like tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker  
dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes ! 
smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan "" catholicism wow ! "" ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished  
i bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions  
proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever  
it's a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma  
the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ's , martin scorsese's 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis' controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the picture's content but to rumours and heresy  
there's a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against  
 ( not one of them had watched it  ) 
every single person refused  
smith and scorsese have a lot in common , and so do the two films in question , because both smith's bethany and scorsese's jesus are hollow shells without their faith  
in fact , dogma's denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown that's worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster  
 ( i felt sentimental about a religion i don't belong to  
now that's powerful filmmaking  ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through "

1,"since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they're portraying , it's fitting to say that "" beloved "" come as a real shock as a film  
it's confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i've seen all year , and that's not necessarily because of the three-hour running time  
 "" beloved "" is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , "" beloved "" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based )  
 "" beloved "" tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children  
when the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family  
sethe is proud , though , and will not move  
her sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation  
a couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging  
he has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot  
when he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies "" it ain't evil  
it's just sad  "" 
some more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears  
but when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house  
her name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills  
she stumbles around , half-grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk  
they let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down  
 "" beloved "" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story  
most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low-lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day psychoanalysts  
sethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , "" they took my milk ! "" 
worst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back  
she runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don't leave them alone  
when she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film , she says she doesn't regret it  
she killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did , and she has convinced herself she did the right thing  
of course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we aren't flat out told that until later on in the film  
beloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long  
thus , "" beloved "" becomes a sorta-redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci-fi classic , "" solaris , "" where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife , who commited suicide years before , has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system  
that film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories , how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past , and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us , it would control us completely  
 "" beloved "" moves along freely , without a lot of explanation , and for the most part , this is extremely respectable  
the most interesting films are the ones that don't explain everything for us , leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense  
sethe is never fully explained as a character , but we understand all her actions since she's being played by oprah winfrey  
it's been well over a decade since her last major performance in "" the color purple , "" but judging from these two films , i'll bet she's one of the best actresses working today    if 
she was strictly an actress  
her talk show , which i suppose is a great entity , has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress , and that's a shame because she brings so much to this movie  
emotion  
sadness  
strength  
watching the strong sethe , who's so afraid of the past that she's built a rather strong protective coating around herself , break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great  
she makes it real "
1,"books could be , and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy , and rightfully so  
this is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70s/early 80s , inspiring literally dozens of clones , from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day , and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre  
the special effects were groundbreaking , revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later  
literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it  
and now , george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy  
much has been and is still being made of the fact that mr  lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now  
some fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection , while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday's star wars updated with today's special effects wizardry  
either way , the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen , where it rightfully deserves to be seen  
can there be anyone in the world who doesn't know what star wars is about ? 
in a way , star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it  
it's a story about a young man's coming of age , a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire , a tale of swashbuckling and derring-do the likes of which haven't been seen on the silver screen in decades , strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn , and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world  
it's high adventure , incredible special effects , and    well , it's just an _experience_  
something about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation    and 
it's about to do so again  
this new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film's devoted fans , who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now  
interviews , trailers , leaks from within lucasfilm    all of these have been collected , collated , and placed on webpages for people to see ( pages such as http : //www  islandnet  com/~corona/films/details/sw4  html 
or , my personal favorite , http : //leopard  cs  latrobe  edu  au/~koukoula/ 
 )  
pictures of before and after have been placed side by side    even 
months before the movies were released , fans were making comparisons  
in some cases , the changes were nothing less than phenomenal , and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater  
the digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here , unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original  
for instance , in my personal favorite example , the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep , moss-covered carvings and etchings  
and mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling , booming city , with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing "

1,"robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible , god-given gifts , but are able to act like ordinary people  
in "" the natural "" ( 1984 ) , he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs , the baseball player who was destined to be "" the best there ever was , "" but still acted like a humble farm boy  
in "" butch cassidy and the sundance kid "" ( 1969 ) , he was the most dangerous shot in the west , yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good-looking charmer  
even in "" indecent proposal "" ( 1993 ) , where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love , redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency , especially when reciting a tale of lost love  
in his latest film , "" the horse whisperer , "" based on the best-selling novel by nicholas evans , redford again plays such a character  
redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie - i suppose the character of tom booker , a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses , was just too good to pass up  
despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses ( a magazine article coins the phrase "" horse whisperer "" to describe his uncanny talent ) , booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life  
booker's talents are taxed into service by annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) , a new york magazine editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , was recently in a horrible accident  
the accident , which is filmed with gut-wrenching horror , happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses - an eighteen-wheeler kills grace's friend , severely wounds and traumatizes grace's horse , pilgrim , and causes grace to lose part of her right leg  
annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed , grace will be healed as well , which leads her to booker  
at first , she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse , but that doesn't work  
instead , she packs up grace and pilgrim , leaves her husband , robert ( sam neill ) behind , and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother , frank ( chris cooper ) , and his sister-in-law , diane ( dianne wiest )  
in many ways , the film is like a journey , both literally and symbolically  
the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal , and it's hard not to see annie and grace's leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs  country  
in "" the horse whisperer , "" country is clearly the victor  
the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness , and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide-open spaces of montana that grace's anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate , annie's controlling nature begins to relax , and pilgrim once again learns to trust people  
redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed "" a river runs through it "" six years ago  
in many ways , "" the horse whisperer "" comes from the same poetic vein as "" river , "" and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera-time on the grass and mountains  
but then , that would ruin the magic  
much of the film's photography is truly elegant , and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land  
to further emphasize this , redford and cinematographer robert richardson ( "" natural born killers , "" "" platoon "" ) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film - which takes place in new york - with mostly cold , harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1  85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shifts to montana , richardson switches to soft-focus and natural lighting , and the screen widens to a 2  35 : 1 aspect ratio  
in terms of the story itself , "" the horse whisperer "" gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean's "" a brief encounter "" ( 1945 ) and clint eastwood's 1995 adaptation of robert james waller's "" the bridges of madison county "" ( richard lagravenese , co-screenwriter here also adapted "" bridges "" )  
although "" the horse whisperer "" has a strong romantic sensibility , i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story  
it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who's being left behind for this brief , heart-sweeping affair , but there rarely is  
in "" the horse whisperer , "" the thankless role of being the fuddy-duddy husband falls to sam neill  
he plays the character as a decent , hard-working man who is a good husband and father ; his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him  
he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away , but simply because he happens to be a normal , fairly uninspiring man  
there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character  
it shows booker and robert going into a horse pen - booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all , while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out-of-place in a baseball cap  
as they enter the pen , booker assuredly swings over the fence , while robert hesitates , then opens the gate and , in a goofy moment , forgets to close it behind him  
it's a small scene , but it clearly demonstrates the movie's thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness  
after all , booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it  
the best scenes in "" the horse whisperer "" tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie , but rather the healing process of grace and her horse  
although booker's horse-training methods are mythical and unrealistic , the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing  
these are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace , some of which are humorous , and all of which are tender and true  
at some point , i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more "

1,"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
be forewarned  
like its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent  
a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking  
the film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop  
as boogie nights opens , he's toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity  
recruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar  
wholeheartedly embraced by jack's troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c  reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his "" one special thing "" are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a "" big bright shining star ""  
his lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in  
the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr  anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious  
from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr  anderson's accomplished command of the camera is without question  
while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco's unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr  anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent  
it's a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker's career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it's somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he's clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he's borrowing from some of the best , and it's entirely effective within the context of this film  
while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it's also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour  
the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre-aids-scare period in american history where uninhibited , free-wheeling lifestyles abounded  
while much of the film's humour pertains to the characters' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope's demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get 'freaky deaky' with the music -- it's elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous  
a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie/dirk's bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking  
ably supported by a well-selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr  anderson's personal collection ) , there's a clear affection for the era in boogie nights  
it's the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film's promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters  
after the debacle with 1996's milos forman film , the people vs  
larry flynt , another finely-crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography-related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public  
however , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it's hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there's very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business  
the glimpses on the sets of jack horner's shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there's a candid matter-of-factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it's refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided  
if anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves  
jack horner's dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence )  
in both films , the world of quickie low-budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack's retort of "" there are shadows in light , baby "" to his cinematographer's complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood's "" it's not about the little details , it's about the big picture ! "" 
rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false  
in boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there's nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an 'artistic' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark  
much like the humour lacing ed wood , the laughs involving jack horner are double-edged ; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres , when jack breathes "" this is the best work i've ever done "" , it's genuinely funny , but given his utter sincerity , also possesses a tinge of sadness  
mr  anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter  
while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn't any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film's characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film's * protagonist * literally doesn't say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it's no wonder why the playfully inane "" how much can you bench ? "" 
banter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film's finest exchanges  
and while mr  anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it's problematic that some of the the threads given to the film's characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore's child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv-movie version of her character's story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions  
still , even if he doesn't always know what to do with his characters , mr "

1,"it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival's palme d'or , a $100 million-plus box office gross , and an oscar nomination ? all for his sophomore outing , pulp fiction  
since then , the talented film maker has been virtually invisible , surfacing briefly as a co-director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire-fest , from dusk till dawn  
in between , he has moonlighted as an "" actor "" with several decidedly unmemorable performances  
now , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown  
and , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard's novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed  
for the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie  
the story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double-crosses and triple-crosses  
and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , '70s pop tunes , and close-ups of womens' bare feet  
yet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown  
the sheer , in-your-face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent  
the mostly-straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn't match up favorably to the non-linear style of tarantino's previous efforts ? an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives  
and there aren't nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around  
there's a samuel l  jackson monologue about guns , a jackson/chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson/robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson/travolta material from pulp fiction , but that's about it  
jackie brown's lone "" innovation "" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives  
this isn't exactly an original technique ? it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa's rashomon and most recently in edward zwick's courage under fire  
however , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino's sole purpose for using it appears to be because it's unconventional  
had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost  
as a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity  
for the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a '70s icon  
this time around , instead of john travolta , it's blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown )  
in one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier's career , tarantino uses a '70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits  
there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking )  
grier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states  
she's working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l  jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official  
no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv's "" banyon "" ) to post the necessary $10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal  
jackie passes ordell's test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 of ordell's money into the united states without tipping off the feds  
soon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell's perpetually oversexed and drugged-out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right-hand man , louis ( robert de niro )  
unsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l  jackson , but ordell isn't nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction  
in addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar- caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination )  
robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely- smile roles  
bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino's foot fetish  
robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking , middle-aged actor  
the film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a- half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown )  
tarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself  
when it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second-tier effort  
it's an entertaining diversion , but not a masterpiece , and certainly not an oscar contender "

1,"in 1912 , a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america  
this ship was built to be the largest ship in the world , and she was  
she was also build to be one of the most luxurious , and that she was  
finally , she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not  
to get a ticket for this voyage you either : spent a life's savings to get to america to start life anew , were part of the upper class and had the money to spare , or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson  
jack dawson makes the trip , and happens to be at the right place at the right time  
rose dewitt bukater , a first class passenger , climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping  
thus is started a tale of romance and intrigue , and a tale of death and tragedy    
this movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago , an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia  
the movie titanic shows what happened , maybe not with a 100% degree of accuracy , but it still shows it very realisticaly  
now the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story  
it serves as both admirably , brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating  
this movie is very emotional simply because of what it is , but that alone is not enough  
the story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective  
movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency  
the attention to detail that was paid is remarkable  
the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting , with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie  
part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting , and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast  
the performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired  
the characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles  
looking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren't acting but are actually the characters in the movie  
the casting for the movie could really have been better , in my humble opinion that is  
one character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself  
yes , you read correctly , the ship is a character  
how is the titanic a character ? 
you ask well simple , a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you  
this character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this  
mr  cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense  
all this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp  
now , to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards  
the effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking  
in some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there , you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening ( if your imagination is good )  
the technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique  
the movie will leave you amazed at the effects , and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie , just humans and an oversized ship  
the movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions , the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes  
now that is not a feat accomplished by most movies , now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch , i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end  
the historical value of this movie is quite high , and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy , for it is extremely well done "
1,"here's a word analogy : amistad is to the lost world as schindler's list is to jurassic park  
in 1993 , after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit , many critics described schindler's list as the director's "" penance "" ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster )  
now , after a three-year layoff , spielberg is back with a vengeance  
once again , his summer release was special effects-loaded action/adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers  
now , following his 1993 pattern , he has fashioned another serious , inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity  
that film is amistad  
although not as masterful as schindler's list , amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture  
thematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact  
watching schindler's list was a powerful , almost spiritual , experience  
spielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three-plus hours later  
aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since  
amistad , while a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent  
the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that's not a surprise  
however , the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric , and , while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account , most of the basic facts are in order  
several , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film's dramatic force  
on the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired  
one stormy night during the summer of 1839 , the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape  
led by the lion-hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , they take control of the vessel , killing most of the crew  
adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa , they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey  
they are tricked , however , and the la amistad , which makes its way northward off the united states' eastern coastline , is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut  
the kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison , charged with murder and piracy  
the first men to come to the africans' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard )  
they are soon joined by roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a property attorney of little repute  
aided by advice from former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) , baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for , and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men , not property -- convinces the judge  
but powerful forces have aligned against baldwin's cause  
current president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , eager to please southern voters and 11-year old queen isabella of spain ( anna paquin ) , begins pulling strings behind-the-scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free  
at its heart , amistad is a tale of human courage  
cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to  
he is a free man , not a slave , and , while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle , he will not give it up  
effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou , whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention , cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies  
they are individuals , and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie's success  
to amplify this point , spielberg presents many scenes from the africans' point-of-view , detailing their occasionally-humorous observations about some of the white man's seemingly-strange "" rituals ""  
the larger struggle is , of course , one of defining humanity  
as the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as "" sub-human , "" so the pro-slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense  
the abolitionists regard the africans as men , but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property  
in a sense , the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war , which would break out less than three decades later , looming over everything  
amistad's presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating , making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history  
four claimants come forward against the africans : the state , which wants them tried for murder ; the queen of spain , who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an american/spanish treaty ; two american naval officers , who claim the right of high seas salvage ; and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad , who demand that their property be returned to them  
baldwin must counter all of these claims , while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque "
1,"first , i am not a big fan of the x-files tv series  
i have nothing against it particularly , i just don't happen to watch it  
having said that , i can now say that i liked the x-files pretty well  
for us non-fans , there's nothing big going for it , but there are a lot of little things  
the movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 , 000 b  c  
two proto-humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside  
the alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien  
the movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy ( lucas black , from sling blade ) is captured by the same black ooze  
we then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder ( gillian anderson and david duchovny ) , who have been pulled off of their previous assignment ( investigations into the paranormal ) and put onto the bomb squad detail  
a caller has threatened a federal building in dallas , texas  
on a hunch , mulder checks out the building across the street , and , wouldn't you know it , he turns out to be right  
the fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse  
five people die in the blast , and when mulder learns who the victims were , a light bulb goes on over his head  
the two agents team up to investigate , against fbi orders , the links mulder has made  
their search leads them back to the north texas cave , all across the country , and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to "" the truth  "" 
the plot , and "" the truth , "" are uninspired  
i got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me  
it didn't  
the possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them  
but the point of the x-files is not what the truth is , but the extent to which it has been hidden  
it's a slightly more interesting angle , but it still raises expectations about that "" truth "" too high  
if this were the whole film , i would say the movie was mediocre , perhaps even boring  
but there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it  
the pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest  
before the audience can get tired of one location , the agents follow a hot tip to another location , and so on and so forth  
the locations are not all computer-generated sets , either  
there are some artificial settings , but the desert night of nevada , the edge of suburbia in texas , and the endless fields of snow in antarctica ( actually somewhere in north america  ) 
make this fantastic film feel more real  
ward russell's cinematography is very good  
the overall look is dark and ominous , appropriate to the intended tone of the film's plot  
russell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding  
when the movie is set in darkness , the picture quality is still rich and detailed  
finally , and specifically , there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train  
i don't know if the shot is faked in any way , but it looks dangerous , and it looks great  
the movie's soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film  ( skip 
to the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie - there is a spoiler in the following sentences  ) during the opening prehistoric sequence , a howling wind dogs the soundtrack , never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound  
in one of the movie's most effective sequences , metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees "

one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise  
with some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie  
there's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there  
the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict  
the premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist  
we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely  
later he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right  
the fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling  
this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone  
the man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him  
in fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc  until after we've observed them for a while  
but in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story  
eventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police  
we met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time  
two other important characters are also introduced : dr  daniel p  schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies  
it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film  
he also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story  
but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo  
everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities  
however , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential  
by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax  
everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction  
but , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off  ' 
for reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' )  
the aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight  
at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then  
this premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard  
he does provide some explanations such as that dr  schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form  
the aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not  
in the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world  
however , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is  
the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either )  
for example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending  
and that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense "

1,"cinema has been around for about a hundred years now  ? 
it's not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film , but i'd like to think that i'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time  
recently , i've seen the films of hitchcock , capra , fellini , godard , kurosawa , chaplin , lang , and many others  
 ? those men were talented artists , and their films reflect their genius  ? 
they are likely to be remembered for  
  
  
well , quite a while  ? 
i like this film , too  ? 
yes , it's a disaster-slash-action movie  ? 
true , its budget is a lot more money than i'll ever see in my lifetime  ? 
and there's not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money  ? 
in fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would've been more profitable  
i certainly don't care what their intentions were , because michael bay ( the rock ) is such a skilled director that i doubt he'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through  
of course , skillful direction doesn't complete the package , but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together  
the story is well-thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) , the acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters  
yes , you read that right  
armageddon actually has characters you can care about ! 
if you don't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be  
if you've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story  
it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film  
so , it's up to the u  s  government to stop it  
 ( why the u  s  is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated  ) 
their plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within  
the head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis )  
his group of men is a colorful bunch , including a  j  
 ( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi )  
there's also an interesting triangle formed between a  j  , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry's daughter  
a  j  
and grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad isn't too happy with the situation  
it's absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you'd like to call armageddon  
it's not about story -- it's about viscera and action , and thrills-a-minute , and all that stuff "
1,"the coen brothers are back again , this time with homer's "" odyssey "" as the backdrop in their tale of three fugitives from a mississippi chain gang who trek across the south to find a secret treasure in "" o brother , where art thou ? "" 
right for the beginning of "" o brother "" the coens grab your attention with a chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks along the road in unison to a work song  
the camera flows around the hard toiling men , giving a visually exciting symmetry to the scene that ends with our three heroes - ulysses everett mcgill ( george clooney ) , delmar ( tim blake nelson ) and pete ( john turturro ) - escaping across a cotton field  
it is the beginning of a journey that takes on different meanings and urgencies to each member of the trio  
a strong suite , as always with the coen brothers , is the depth of character of the folks they create in their films  
their characters are goofy and comical , like nicolas cage in "" raising arizona "" ; or , dramatic , as albert finney and john turturro in "" miller's crossing "" ; and , even a mix of the two with frances mcdormand in "" fargo  "" 
in all cases , and in "" o brother , "" too , the characters populating their films are three-dimensional people  
ulysses everett is a handsome , hair-obsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue and not a lot in the brains department  
but , he seems like a genius when compared to the simple , sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete , who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of $1  2 million  
their odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of homer's original material as they meet all manner of people along the way , including those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and a cyclops who beats them and takes all their money  
there is magic , too , when delmar believes that pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens  
the story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys' adventures , giving the flick a choppy , episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow  
some of the interludes are an epiphany , though  
the trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitar-playing tommy johnson ( chris thomas king ) and visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere , run by its blind owner ( stephen root )  
they become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man and , without their knowledge , are recorded as they sing the traditional tune , "" i am a man of constant sorrow  "" 
it is a wonderful moment of moviemaking and gives us , in my mind , the best movie song of the year  
contrasting this and other wonderful moments ( the sexy seduction by the sirens comes to mind ) are some pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of "" o brother  "" 
in particular , near the end , is a scene where ulysses , delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched  
the scene is overblown and flashy and reeks of "" the wizard of oz  "" 
they don't say "" lions and tigers and bears , oh my ! "" 
and there's no dorothy , but it is the land of oz we're seeing here  
the highs and lows of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several levels  
george clooney is funny , charming , a little dumb and one of the handsomest actors in the business today  
he has the charm of a 30's movie idol and is able to put himself into silly situations with dignity  
ulysses has an ongoing obsession with his hair , risking life and limb to get a particular brand of pomade and a supply of hairnets  
his vanity will come to plague him as it would any mystical hero-wanderer  
while clooney is the name draw for "" o brother , "" the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar  
the heretofore unknown nelson is terrific as the simple convict who , at one point , hears the word of the lord and joins members of a church congregation in their mass baptism  
delmar is saved and dedicates his life to doing good and provides a richness to his simple character that makes him shine  
the taciturn pete , as played by longtime coen collaborator turturro , is the sullen member of the trio and gives them the necessary angst  
all together , the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the three stooges and the three musketeers as they prove to be buffoons , albeit brave ones  
the colorful supporting cast is rampant with homerian characters to meet and get to know along the way of the boys' odyssey  
charles durning appears as incumbent governor pappy o'daniel , who keeps crossing paths with them in his bid for re-election  
john goodman is wicked as the one-eyed bible salesman and con artist , big dan teague  
michael badalucco is manic and outrageous as outlaw and bank robber extraordinary , george "" babyface "" nelson  
stephen root is amusing as the blind dj , rep'ing one of the many references to the sightless that abound in the film in mystical ways  
holly hunter is wasted in the small role as ulysses' estranged wife , penny ( and the real reason for this adventure , not secret treasure )  
techs are , as expected in a coen brothers venture , first class  
cinematographer roger deakins , who has worked on five previous coen films , captures the sultry atmosphere of the south  
the photography complements the lush period production and costume provided by dennis gassner and mary zophres , respectively "

1,"you may not have heard of lucas , or if you have , you might not think much of it  
probably because it stars corey haim , or maybe because it's about a little geek who collects insects , or maybe because it doesn't feature slick one-liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80's  
however , you have been missing out on a true masterpeice , the best film of 1986 , and the best film about adolescent life ever made  
corey haim stars as lucas bligh , a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair , thick glasses , and an interest in insects and other outdoor life  
one day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him  
her name is maggie , a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty , with lovely red hair and a sweet , innocent complexion  
maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her , but somehow he interests her , and soon they are talking and getting to know one another  
they gradually become good friends , and spend the summer together doing various things , such as studying insects ( namely locusts , who come out of hiding once every 17 years ) , playing tennis , and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover  
lucas is obviously in love with maggie , and while she is charmed by him , it's clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend  
this is not clear to lucas , however  
he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate , and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what's about to happen  
we soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally  
they throw him on stage , right in front of his beloved maggie  
surprisingly , he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around , but he takes it too far , and is embarassed in front of the entire school  
the next scene is brilliant  
maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally  
she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened  
he rails back against her , in a cruel unfair fashion  
in lesser movies this would've turned into a confrontation between the two characters  
but maggie is written smarter than that  
she understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him  
next we are introduced to another great character named cappie ( charlie sheen )  
he is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend  
what's interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks  
of course anyone with a brain can tell what's gonna happen next  
cappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas' relationship  
this begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone  
she's been assigned to show him how to operate the washer/dryer so he can clean his shirt  
maggie is charmed by cappie's tender undertsanding demeanor , not to mention his shirtless body  
this scene is so delicate and sweet , but cappie still has a girlfriend , preventing either one from acting on their desires  
desperately trying to puncture the tension , cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room  
it's not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend ( in the films only subpar scene )  
lucas finally figures out what's going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance  
this causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself , such as try out for the football team  
the last third of the film revolves around this attempt  
while the idea seems cliched , the way it is executed is not  
there are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up  
dave grusin's memorable score , played at the perfect moments , certainly helps  
lucas is filled with great performances "

1,"with the release of gattaca , i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens , or aliens in general  
hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films , but what was usually lacking was a good story    
and good characters    
and good acting , etc ( contact being the exception )  
and for some reason , hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth  
the closest , that i have seen anyway , was 2001 : a space odyssey , which made mankind an alien race themselves , being dwarfed by the technology which they created  
now comes gattaca , another film about technology reigning supreme , except here on our planet  
the difference between 2001 and this one is simple : gattaca is more frightening  
most of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering  
using this premise , writer/director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills  
unfortunately , due to a lack of advertising , i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office  
since seeing the film , i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca  
lately , however , i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca  
most people don't even realize that it is a film  
despite this fact , i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it  
niccol's film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter , better produced , and more realistic  
gattaca begins in the 21st century  
procreating is now done in a petri dish , and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it  
natural child birth is considered old-fashioned  
we are introduced to jerome morrow ( ethan hawke ) , an employee of the gattaca space program  
one of the directors of the program has been murdered , and the main suspect is one vincent freeman  
the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman  
vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love  
however , after his birth , and through several genetic tests , doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99% chance of a weak heart , as well as poor eye sight and a short life span  
as a result , both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics  
anton ( loren dean ) is produced without flaws , and the competition between brothers spawns  
vincent has a dream to fly a solo-flight around the titan , the 14th moon of saturn , but because of his condition , gattaca , and society in general , forces him to do menial labor around the company  
labeled an "" in-valid , "" vincent's dream seems impossible , until he meets a black-market dna specialist , german ( tony shalhoub )  
german introduces him to a "" valid "" who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident  
jerome morrow ( jude law ) agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools ( urine , blood , skin and hair samples , etc  ) that he will need to get past gattaca's tight security  
in exchange , vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship  
after the murder , however , his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincent's eyelashes left at the scene of the crime  
irene cassini ( uma thurman ) is a genetically flawed "" valid "" working for gattaca , and she begins to fall in love with vincent/jerome  
gattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time "

rated pg-13 for mild language , adult situations , drug use , martial art action and violence  
107 minutes  
super 35mm / panavision ( 2  35 : 1 ) 
what can you say about jackie chan that hasn't already been said  
since the release of 'rumble in the bronx "" back in 1996 ( the u  s  release ) , jackie has become a fairly recognizable commodity on america's video shelves  
having made over 80 films , jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of action-comedy to the west  
his latest release , "" shanghai noon "" , is a joyful tribute / spoof of the classic western  
and by adding jackie chan into the genre , the tag line for the film ( "" the western gets a kick in the pants "" ) rings true  
jackie stars as chon wang , a lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china  
the royal princess pei pei ( lucy liu ) is set to be married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture  
unwilling to follow her father's wishes , princess pei pei with the assistance of her english tutor , decides to escape to america  
but this is all a ploy devised by exiled guard lo fong , which will lead to the princess' kidnapping and ransom  
unable to take any legal action , the ransom demands are met and three of the forbidden city's bravest guards ( played by cui ya hi , rong guang yu , and eric chen ) are ordered to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson city , nevada  
chon wang pleads with the imperial court and is given permission to join the team , as he is looked upon as a buffoon  
on a train in the u  s  jackie meets up with bandit roy o'bannon ( owen wilson )  
he is much less of a bandit than he is a glory hog , looking simple for the notoriety and fame that being a bandit will bring him  
with his gang in tow , roy attempts to rob the train , when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court , who also happens to be chon wang's uncle  
chon wang gives chase , foiling the attempted robbery , but also leaving himself stranded in the desert  
as the disgraced guard wanders through the desert , he again comes upon roy , who has been left for dead by his former gang  
buried up to his neck in the desert , roy pleads with chon to dig him out  
chon demands to know where carson city is  
roy directs him , and chon leaves  
but not before sticking two chopsticks into roy's mouth and telling him to dig himself  
chon soon finds himself confronted by angry crow warriors , a friendly sioux tribe , gunslingers , a horse that thinks and behaves like a dog and an indian bride ( brandon merrill ) , before once again running into roy  
 "" shanghai noon "" is just good fun  
the chemistry between the cast is remarkable  
the performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film  
jackie's performance is as good as anything he's done before  
he's not called on to do much acting here , as the character is not written with any depth  
but jackie's natural charisma shines through , and his comic timing is so perfect , both physically and ( surprise ) verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on  
owen wilson , last seen in the embarrassing remake of "" the haunting "" , gives a good natured performance as roy o'bannon  
his innocence is refreshing and fun  
a bad guy that's not really bad  
his scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis  
lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script , but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant "
1,"i was pleasantly surprised by this film  
with a budget topping $200 million , i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century's greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see  
how much could you dress up the sets ? 
how many models and computer effects could you use ? 
how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks ? 
oh , if i've just given away part of the plot for you , go back to school  
after having viewed titanic , however , i found it to be a well-paced , well-designed , and overall well-made movie  
there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic , but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i've seen  
titanic tells its story in two time periods  
it starts out in the present , when ocean explorer brock lovett ( bill paxton ) and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic , searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship  
what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace , which is broadcast on the news  
the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett , who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas  
there she tells her story to lovett and his team  
in 1912 , rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) , a young lady belonging to society's upper class , boards the titanic for the ship's first atlantic crossing , from southampton , england to new york  
she is engaged to cal hockley ( billy zane ) , an heir to old money , and a snob in every sense of the word  
on board , rose feels the stifling trappings of high-society's expectations , and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic's stern , but is saved from her self-proclaimed fate by jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a passenger in third-class ( "" steerage "" , as it's referred to ) , who talks her out of jumping  
although for rose the attraction is not immediate , a love affair soon develops between the two , which endangers rose's social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal  
the story sounds very simple , and perhaps even unexciting , but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron , a good movie comes through  
dicaprio is marvelous as the young , but worldly-wise jack , playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors  
his is a character that is immediately likable , as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations  
girls are going to swoon over him  
winslet also proves herself a good actress , delivering her lines convincingly , and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable  
the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character's upbringing  
simply by judgment of her gait , i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper-crust debutante  
rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess , she sometimes looks positively clumsy , and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting  
billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal , since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him  
his features are such that even when he smiles , there's something mistrustful about him , and when he scowls , he is evil incarnate  
he's something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher , but a cheaper model  
like dicaprio and winslet , zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well  
backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy , cal's personal assistant ( or "" man "" as they said at the turn of the century )  
no matter who else is in the cast , you can always count on a good performance by warner , who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match  
additionally , there are a number of smaller fictional and non-fictional roles thrown in for color , such as kathy bates as "" the unsinkable "" molly brown , danny nucci as jack's friend fabrizio de rossi , eric braeden as john jacob astor , and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie  
nice to see dr  bombay getting work  
also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die  
this by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic , but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship's crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the first-class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else  
in this way , titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures  
you don't just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop , but a very real account of class struggle as well  
as i mentioned before , the budget for this film was tremendous , and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects  
the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail , and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic  
with regard to the exteriors , i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale  
cameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank , but only had room for 90% , and therefore had to computer-generate the remaining 40 feet "

1,"veteran actor clint eastwood has never looked as grizzled as he does in true crime , his latest directorial effort  
when steve everett ( his newest character ) gets angry at someone , he glares them down with those famous dirty harry eyes , furrows his brow and frowns like a grizzly bear who's just lost his cubs  
eastwood has played some particularly despicable characters in his time , but everett could just take the cake  
he gets my vote , at least , partly because `ev' is a drunken affair-a-week womanizer who has many relationship problems , very few of which are with his wife ( diane venora )  
when his colleague at the oakland tribune is in an ugly car wreck and dies , everett must take over for her at a vital interview session  
the interview is with frank beacham ( isaiah washington ) , a death-row inmate set to die at midnight for the murder of a pregnant convenience store clerk  
eastwood furrows his brow  
as everett gradually finds information , he realizes that beacham could very well be innocent  
he interviews a key witness ( michael jeter ) , who claims that he burst in the door at pocum's foods because his car had overheated , only to see beacham standing over the dead woman's body , blood on his suspenders , gun in hand  
but everett protests : how could he have seen the gun , which was lowered by his side , with the potato chip rack in front of him ? 
jeter doesn't know what he's talking about  
eastwood furrows his brow  
crinkled expressions and all , clint is the centre of energy of true crime  
the film is by no means a standard action/suspense yarn , but a thoughtful human story in which the characters come before the shoot-outs  
isaiah washington has a break-out performance as frank beacham , and scenes with him and his weary wife ( lisa gay hamilton ) are truly heartfelt moments  
but the best scenes are ones that feature eastwood duking it out with those in authority over him  
denis leary , as everett's editor and boss , has more than a few memorable moments of restrained anger ( you see , ev is sleeping with his wife )  
but hands down , the most enjoyable segments of the film are when james woods is on camera  
playing the big boss alan mann , woods and eastwood create amusing chemistry and laugh-out-loud punchlines  
when true crime opts for a high-speed chase to the governer's house at the finale , the quality of film-making takes an abrupt nosedive  
eastwood was so successful with colorful character portraits that he didn't need to switch lanes  
true crime is a tension-building , intriguing drama showcase for the talented director and star  
this is a road block he could have easily dismissed ( i furrow my brow )

1,"most sequels don't do what they're supposed to do like "" toy story 2 "" does  
far too many of them end up re-hashing the original and adding very little  
is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors ? 
thankfully , "" toy story 2 "" is a wonderful exception  
i can't remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one  
it's yet another sign that pixar , the acclaimed animation studio behind "" toy story "" and "" a bug's life , "" is still at the top of its game  
woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit "" toy story , "" and things have changed a bit since the last one ended  
woody ( voiced by tom hanks ) is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp  
in his absence , he has assigned buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , now comfortable in his role as a toy , to take charge  
unfortunately , woody's trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale , and is stolen by an over-zealous toy collector ( wayne knight )  
off to save him are buzz and members of the old "" toy gang , "" including mr  potato head ( don rickles ) , rex the nervous dinosaur ( wallace shawn ) , hamm the piggy bank ( john ratzenberger ) , and slinky dog ( jim varney )  
while in captivity , woody makes a startling discovery : he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a 1950's children's show entitled "" woody's roundup  "" 
he meets the show's other characters , which include jesse ( joan cusack ) , his cowgirl sidekick , the wise old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) , and bullseye , his trusty horse  
they have all been anxiously awaiting woody's arrival , as once their set is completed , they will be sold to a japanese toy museum , and finally escape storage forever  
this means woody now faces a difficult choice  
with his friends coming to rescue him , does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy , or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever ? 
as in the original film , "" toy story 2 "" contains first-rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there  
reportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct-to-video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters  
the film is well worth seeing on the big screen  
the colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more "" human  "" 
the animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable  
there are so many impressive sequences that i'd find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al' s toy barn , the store owned by woody's captor  
pixar's rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it  
the voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development  
tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice  
it was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim  
all the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent  
several new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work  
 "" toy story 2 "" is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie  
woody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn't yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like  
the new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner  
it may be computer-animated , and it may have sappy music , but it's downright touching  
the script , despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers , is endlessly clever and inventive , especially considering that it's a sequel  
the reason "" toy story 2 "" works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original's success by re-doing the same story and using the same characters  
not this one  
we get character change , new characters , and new issues brought up  
 "" toy story 2 "" is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself  
there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here  
the humor is sharp and witty , with something to amuse both kids and adults  
there are funny asides to films such as "" star wars "" and "" jurassic park , "" among others , new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock 'em sock 'em robots , and appearances from other pixar efforts "" a bug's life "" and the 1997 short "" geri 's game "
1,"jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway  
in as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive-compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you-know-where  
he's mean  
i mean really mean  
the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium  
every day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress  
you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe  
one day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks  
at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too  
another person who often crosses melvin's sights is simon ( greg kinnear ) , an artist who lives on melvin's floor  
aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city , simon has the added benefit of being gay , making him a prime target  
simon's friend frank ( cuba gooding , jr  ) , also gay , does not fare much better  
when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment , he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital , and frank , who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor , intimidates melvin into watching after simon's dog while he convalesces  
this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage  
an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in : melvin gets to like the dog , and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin's softening up to the world around him  
it doesn't happen overnight , but throughout the film , he bites his tongue here , cares a little there , and most miraculously , falls in love  
one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others  
he's traveling terra incognita here , and it shows  
good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film , especially by nicholson and hunt  
they play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen  
greg kinnear , who is becoming known for his supporting film roles , is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon  
he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist , and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels  
cuba gooding jr  performs with a hyped-up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear , and comes through with a near constant comic performance  
the screenplay , by mark andrus and james l  brooks , is clever , touching , and funny  
the best part about it , however , is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting  
melvin is a man we can't quite figure out , but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention  
carol is a working woman living with her mother , trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem  
simon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers , but who is still not accepted by much of society  
combined with the talent of the actors , these characters make the film  
the one noticeable area where the film is lacking , however , is the absence of cuba gooding , jr  through the second half  
his character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary , but the film ends before his return , leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved  
i would have liked to have seen more of his character in general , in addition to a part in the film's conclusion  
there's one actor , who will probably not be recognized by any awards , but who contributes greatly to many of the movie's best scenes and who deserves mention  
this is that little dog  
he plays such a pivotal role to melvin's character development , actually serves to forward the plot , and has some absolutely scene-stealing moments , that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal "

1,"did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion ? 
that is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward , with a comatose sunny von bulow  
she is the main narrator of the film , in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder  
the dramatic trick works , as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder , sex , unhappiness , and a lawyer's moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win  
jeremy irons is claus von bulow , in what is his finest role , and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history  
he is as hated as any man alive , as cold as a cucumber  
his remorse for his wife's comatose condition is nonexistant , and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas , 1980  
the background to the case is such  
during christmas of 1979 , sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke  
the same situation occured in 1980 , only sunny never woke , and probably never will  
when examined , it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood  
claus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson , convicted , and freed on bail  
he immediately hires alan dershowitz , the renowed harvard law professor , to acquit him  
ron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him  
we follow him through two very different cases ; the case of the johnson case , where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didn't commit , and von bulow , who he still hasn't figured out  
dershowitz doesn't know what happened to sunny , and he is extremely hesitant to take the case  
nevertheless , he does , based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him  
together with a group of law students , dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed  
silver's performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film  
schroeder directs on many different levels , with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz  
there are flaws ; at times , the film gets overly theatrical  
yet , due to glenn close's troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow , the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well  
the flashbacks are good , but at times schroeder doesn't fill in the blanks  
the movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film , and it could have used a better ending  
the film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly , without any intelligent conclusion  
the supporting characters are often neglected , and dershowitz's team should have been allowed to grow character wise , but schroeder over-simplifies the story and the characters  
yet , for all these flaws , the film is deeply engrossing because of irons  
as von bulow , he is brutally evil  
anti-semitic , prejudiced , arrogant , protective , he is a rotten , lying monster , whose conviction may have been wrong legally , but morally he was to blame  
irons plays him to a cold perfection , with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence  
he is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder  
however , the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility  
there is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wife's death by years of neglect and coldness  
however , legally , did he do the murder ? 
schroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind  
with all the character flaws , reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent ; he wants the viewer to make up his own mind  
schroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations , and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow , in death  
for all the failed dramatic theatrics , this is one that works beautifully  
we don't know what happened  
that sense of legal ambiguousness , along with von bulow's obvious moral guilt , is why reversalf fortune works  
in the end , von bulow is as sadistic as ever "

1,"mike myers , you certainly did throw us a ? frickin' bone here in what you call ? the biggest austin powers adventure yet  ' 
austin powers : the spy who shagged me is the sequel to the 1997 smash comedy austin powers : international man of mystery  
many are skeptical about sequels , saying that the sequel is never better or as good as the original , but austin powers : tswsm goes beyond the first film  
austin powers : the spy who shagged me stars mike myers in three different roles  
he reprises his role as the title character , austin powers , the shagadelic spy whose body was frozen in 1967 , and unfrozen in 1997 to stop his long time nemesis dr  evil , also played by mike myers , from destroying the earth  
tswsm leaves off where the original stopped , with dr  evil's ? frisch's big boy' space capsule floating through space  
dr  evil returns back to earth by ejecting from his capsule , plotting to go back in his time machine to the year 1967 , in which he plans to steal austin powers' "" mojo "" , what keeps austin going with spy talents  
upon his return to his secret lair , which is now a starbucks coffee shop , dr  evil learns that his evil henchman , which includes the returning robert wagner as number 2 and mindy sterling as frau , have created a 1/8 size clone of dr  evil , which is later named mini me  
the evil mini me replaces scott evil , played by seth green , as dr  evil's son in the madman's mind , because dr  evil thinks of scott to be only "" quasi-evil  "" 
dr  evil has always wanted a son that is evil just like him , and now he has one  
dr  evil tells mini me , "" you complete me , "" in a loving manner  
dr  evil loving ? 
wow ! 
mike myers' third role is as fat bastard , a scottish henchman of dr  evil's , who is sent to steal the mojo from austin powers' frozen body  
austin powers learns of dr  evil's trip back into the 60s , and uses his own time machine to take him back to 1967 , to try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold of it  
once arriving in the year 1967 , austin travels to his "" pad "" , his smashing home/dance club , where he meets felicity shagwell , played by heather graham , a cia agent who is willing to help him in his journey to stop dr  evil  
as the film progresses , hilarious one liners are thrown at us , mainly by dr  evil , for example , "" don't go there , girlfriend ! "" 
to the president of the united states  
many witty gags take place , note the entire tent scene , and just plain , funny scenes which are so stupid- they're funny come a dozen per fifteen minutes  
take for example , scott evil going on the jerry springer show complaining about how evil his father is  
the way austin powers : tswsm uses its humor is clever , throwing a hilarious scene at you , followed by five minutes of one liners , followed by another outrageous scene , so you never stop laughing  
there was honestly not one moment in austin powers : tswsm where i wasn't laughing  
the last film that i laughed so hard in , was well , austin powers ! 
it is apparent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it  
the film even makes fun of itself in a line , something along the lines of , "" it's funny how england and southern california look nothing alike  "" 
tswsm was filmed in southern california , but was supposed to take place in england  
i can tell you one thing- he is having a lot of fun with this enormously popular character , which is all over television , newspapers , magazines , and the movie theaters  
i believe that dr  evil got more attention in the tswsm than austin powers did "

1," ""   it's certainly more than just a monster story   "" 
- kenneth branagh , director/actor/co-writer of mary shelley's frankenstein  
kenneth branagh's new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein-films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world , including the most controversial version of them all - directed by james whale  
the dark and stormy nights , the lightning bolts , the charnel houses of spare body parts , the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful  
but the center of the film , quieter and more thoughtful , contains the real story  
horror-fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror  
branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues : morality , philosophy and human elements of the story , and not on old fashioned horror cliches  
his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel  
the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean  
the year is 1794  
a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters  
his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs  
as the ice closes around his ship , a figure appears on the horizon  
it's a man  
exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew  
his name is victor frankenstein ( kenneth branagh ) and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown  
the myserious stranger begins his tale , or more precisely his confession , in geneva , 1773  
he is remembering his childhood and youth  
laughter , banquets and parties - a happy life , without troubles or concerns  
here victor lived with his father ( ian holm ) , mother ( cherie lunghi ) , his surrogate sister ( helena boham carter ) and his servants in happiness and harmony  
this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed  
like thunder from a quite sky , his mother dies , giving birth to his youngest brother  
shocked , baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair , victor ( already interested in science ) becomes obsessed with death  
standing on his mother's grave he says : "" oh mother   you 
did not have to die    no one should ever die    i 
will stop this   i 
promiss   "" 
after proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished , victor travels to ingolstadt , in presuite of a medical career "

1,"i have to say it  
tim burton's retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys  
ok , that's off my chest  
no more monkey puns , i promise  
seriously , though , planet of the apes is one rip-roarin' summer outing , filled with thrills , action , adventure , wit and bits of funny ( dare i say , monkey ) business  
i know , i know , i promised  
and for those film buffs who are fond of the original , burton's version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie  
mark wahlberg stars as capt  leo davidson , a deep-space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future  
he crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted , captured and sold into slavery  
despite being darker than the original , burton's film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious  
some of the movie's flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton : an organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed  
then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter  
the seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty : "" one thing you don't want in your house is a human teen-ager , "" he says  
you don't have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement  
touches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton's brand  
lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout : the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian's foot to try righting himself are : "" take your stinking hand off of me , you damned , dirty human  "" 
anyone familiar with the first version of the film will , of course , recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue  
another of burton's in-jokes is to have charlton heston , star of the original , play the chimpanzee father of tim roth's gen  thade  
the young chimp goes to visit his dying father  
both have one thing in common , a hatred of humans  
with his dying breath , the elder spews out his vile : "" damn them , damn them all to hell , "" he says before expiring  
that is the famous line heston's taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet's terrible secret  
the performances throughout are top-notch  
wahlberg plays davidson not as some gung-ho hero , but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home  
he is reluctant to lead the human rebellion ; his only objective being to find a way off this upside-down planet  
this hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable  
roth is ferocious , cunning , cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity  
he leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet  
it is a masterful turn  
helena bonham carter is ari , the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals  
hers is a smart , compassionate characterization  
michael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken  
a fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo , the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures  
as the battle between apes and humans looms , the cowardly limbo pleads , "" can't we all just get along , "" echoing the words of rodney king  
much of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton's technical crew , especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup  
burton's musical collaborator , danny elfman , provides another fine score , though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow  
the movie's only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original "
1,"ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances  
for his followup to the academy-beloved the english patient , he has once again turned to a love story , this time directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong ( little women )  
despite some obvious overplotting , oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences  
the film opens in the mid-1800s , with parallel storylines in new south wales , australia and devon , england  
as the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us , lucinda leplastrier ( cate blanchett ) is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback  
meanwhile , half the world away , oscar hopkins ( fiennes ) has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues , and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest  
lucinda is fascinated with glass ; oscar is obsessed with theology  
lucinda is rich ; oscar is poor  
lucinda is forward and self-assured ; oscar is timid and uncertain of himself  
yet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals -- the compulsion to gamble , whether it's on horses , dogs , cards , or the flip of a coin  
and fate has decreed that they will one day meet  
that day doesn't occur until 45 minutes into the film , when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney , australia , where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help  
another of the passengers is lucinda , who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newly-acquired glassworks factory  
at first , their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor , but it doesn't take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other  
a friendship is born , and , once they reach australia , it develops into something more potent  
but oscar is uncertain of lucinda's affection , and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her  
oscar and lucinda isn't beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response , and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions  
on more than one occasion , it's apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route  
coincidence is a crucial plot device ; without it , this movie can't go anywhere  
the voiceover narration ( never one of my favorite techniques ) is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments  
 ( however , without it , the final twist , which i will not reveal , would not be as poignant  ) 
yet , despite these quibbles , i enjoyed oscar and lucinda  
storyline faults pale in the light of two such finely-realized characters  
thematically , the film is also strong  
the unifying motif -- that everything in life is a gamble -- is successfully delineated  
oscar and lucinda don't just wager their money , they bet their hearts , minds , and souls  
a card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form of emotional "" strip poker "" where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared , secret passion  
oscar does not see gambling as a vice  
in fact , he believes that the greatest chance one takes in life is betting one's immortal soul on the truth of a religious faith  
ralph fiennes , who normally plays strong , confident men , is very much at home as the fumbling , insecure oscar  
the actor brings a variety of nervous tics to the part , all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is on-screen  
as good as fiennes is , however , he is eclipsed by cate blanchett  
the actress , who appeared earlier this year as one of the leads in bruce beresford's paradise road , is mesmerizing as lucinda  
she gives this liberated woman her flash , and feeds the chemistry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rather than fizzles  
effective support is provided by ciaran hinds ( the male lead in jane austen's persuasion ) as lucinda's close friend , tom wilkinson ( the full monty ) as oscar's mentor , and clive russell as a self-serving adventurer  
there's a real magic in the way armstrong develops the story , keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long on any one moment or sequence  
 ( in fact , i wish she had devoted a little more time to the luminous middle act , which has oscar and lucinda together  ) 
with the skill of a consummate storyteller , she weaves romance , friendship , passion , humor , and tragedy together into a complete package  
the characters , with all of their human foibles and neuroses , are wonderfully developed by fiennes and blanchett "

1,"it is easy to see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his a  i  
artificial intelligence , just as it is understandable why spielberg was attracted to the material  
for here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home , an outcast seeking family , themes very familiar from most of spielberg's body of work from sugarland express to close encounters of the third kind to e  t  
to empire of the sun to hook to saving private ryan , naming just a few examples  
a  i  is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies  
it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances  
the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions , and with the number of births limited by the government , many couples are yearning for children  
and professor hobby ( william hurt ) has the solution  
a robotic boy named david ( haley joel osment ) , who is programmed to love  
as a test , david is placed with henry swinton ( sam robards ) and his wife , monica ( frances o'connor )  
their natural-born son has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be found for his illness  
the first third of a  i  
deals with david's life with the swintons and how that is changed by the recovery and return of their son , martin  
circumstances force david to be cut off from the swintons  
he is abandoned and alone  
david , highly influenced by the fairy tale , pinocchio , feels that if he becomes a real boy he can rekindle monica's love for him  
the film's second act follows david's search for the blue fairy , whom he believes will be able to fulfill his wish  
during these adventures he meets and is helped by gigolo joe ( jude law ) , a robot who specializes in sex  
spielberg is at his top form in this sequence , offering a brutal "" flesh fair "" where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying customers  
here , is where kubrick's influence is strongly felt , as the movie explores the fear and distrust humans have for robots  
the savagery conjures up images from the late director's a clockwork orange  
at about two hours and 30 minutes , the film begins to falter during the last 20 minutes , a sequence that seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed from close encounters  
it is all very anti-climatic and jarring  
these scenes seem almost superfluous , as if from a different film  
a  i  is a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg-13 rating  
it is a story combining hope and intolerance , sacrifice and bigotry , and while it does not coalesce perfectly , the movie does offer some disturbing images  
but a  i  
is really a showcase for the acting talents of the amazing young osment  
if ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination , it is this lad , who brings a sense of joy and wonder to the role of david , a being created for the express purpose of loving  
he shines when with monica , beaming with love , as eager as a puppy to please  
after being left in the woods , he is confused , lost , hurt , focusing on one objective : to become a real boy and find his way home so he can redeem himself in his mother's eyes "
1," "" oh my god , i sounded just like a mother ! "" 
mrs  pascal , played with devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold , tells her son  
 "" didn't i sound just like a mother ? "" 
 "" you are a mother , "" her son marty tells her disgustedly  
 "" i know , but i still can't believe it  
i look at you people and wonder , how did you ever fit in my womb ? "" 
marty , you see , is a grown-up twin  
although his sister , who thinks she is jackie-o , is certifiably insane , marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes  
mother and daughter , played in a brilliant performance by parker posey , are both varying degrees of wacko  
most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and mean-spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is  
the daughter's fantasy of being jackie-o is probably the most sane part of her being  
mrs  pascal is the sort that will not let jackie-o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level  
she explains to marty's new fiancee , lesly ( tori spelling ) , soon after their first meeting that jackie-o was holding marty's private part when she came out of the womb  
the dialog by wendy macleod , based on the play by mark waters , is so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment  
the script , reminiscent of a david mamet play , flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters  
the exaggerated setup has lesly and marty arriving at the family's out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane  
in this storm are two sane individuals  
the fiancee is a giddy , school-girl type , embarrassed by everything , a complete contrast to her rival jackie-o's bitter pseudo-sophistication  
as the two twins' younger brother , anthony , freddie prinze jr  plays the all-america boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his brother's fiancee that night  
 "" we all have our secrets , "" jackie-o tells her potential sister-in-law , and boy , does she have a few  
this is a house filled with them  
 ( when lesly calls it the family's "" home "" to mrs  pascal -- they've never had a visitor before lesly -- mrs  pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly is talking about their "" house  "" ) 
in a film that gives new meaning to the phrase , "" made for each other , "" the twin's biggest , but not their only secret , is that they've had a long-term incestuous relationship  
they don't like to discuss it , although they are not particularly ashamed of it  
perfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy , this story never pulls its punches  
jackie-o tries in many ways , few subtle , to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his  
in one scene marty and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackie-o pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands  
marty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy  
the chemistry between parker posey and josh hamilton is nothing short of amazing  
they put down their little brother and most of the other sane people in the world  
their ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best  
director mark waters keeps the show's energy level high and lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace  
his crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it  
jackie-o is temperamentally incapable of being nice  
and being jealous , she cuts lesly down mercilessly  
 "" were you poor ? "" 
jackie-o asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime of growing up impoverished  
 "" did you eat pies ? 
chicken pot pies ? "" 
 "" pancakes actually , lots of pancakes , "" lesly replies with her usual sincerity "

1,"this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city , of james cameron's most heralded film , titanic  
postponed from last summer , with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history , this was one film i was eager to preview  
so , is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday ? 
my best guess     it will sink , though with many awards attatched to its hull  
no doubt , titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made  
it boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date  
to see a ship fall apart , with actual people running across the ship , flying across the deck , and falling to the water , is just amazing to look at  
the effects are so stunningly realistic , you would swear you were looking at actual footage  
but titanic is more than a disaster movie , and that's where the problem lies  
there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise  
i'll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you : 
the film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic  
we see actual footage of the sunken ship , as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor  
bill paxton leads the expedition , in search of sunken treasure  
what he finds instead , leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage  
we meet rose ( kate winslet ) , a young woman , who comes from an upper-class family  
rose is to be wed to a man she does not love  
we meet jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a young man , who comes from a poor financial background , and wins a ticket aboard the titanic , in a poker game  
the two meet under interesting circumstances , and the love story begins  
add in a jealous fiance , and a not-so-nice law officer played by david warner , and you have a story that , well , gets a bit overplayed and oversappy  
i must add , at this point , that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates , as a woman with "" new money "" who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship  
she is a pleasure to see on screen  
when the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1 : 40 into the film , and eventually sinks , you never really feel for any of these characters  
the film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on  
the effects are tremendous  
from the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room , to a doomed ship cracking at the seams , this is an effects picture that looks and sounds like no other  
we saw titanic in dolby digital surround , and by far , it is the best sounding movie i have ever seen  
my friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard  
when people are in the water , at film's end , you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles  
titanic runs far too long  
the movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length  
and , while most of the first 2  5 hours runs very fast and well-paced , the final 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop , and you realize that this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends  
don't get me wrong about titanic    "

1," "" i'd rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell , "" earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher  
with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister , hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story  
he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american , and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation  
from elmer gantry on , we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church  
well , think again , for the apostle , which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade , does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister , and by implication all , the rest of organized religion  
instead it gives us a highly devout man , who certainly has his foibles , but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god  
and arguably just as surprising , the good-spirited film is no comedy , even if it does have humorous moments  
instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures  
when in the privacy of his attic , robert duvall , as texas preacher euliss "" sonny "" dewey , argues sternly with his lord , the scene shares a kinship with emily watson's character crying out for her god in breaking the waves's most powerful scene  
the body of the story starts with sonny's coming upon an horrific auto accident , which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters  
with his well worn bible in hand , sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident's dying victims  
the scowling police officer orders him to go away , and , after he has tried to work his miracles , sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord's work  
robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film's director , writer , executive producer , and chief financier  
rarely has a movie been such a labor of love  
with a white suit , peach-colored shirt and tie , and dark sunglasses , sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher  
duvall has every movement down pat  
even when he is walking down the street , the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy  
he dances and claps all the way  
sonny's churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep-voiced black orators , but his rhetoric is always competitive  
 "" i may be on the devil's hit-list , but i'm on god's mailing list , "" he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent  
and they lap it up  
people jump up , scream , "" praise the lord ! "" 
and mean it  
the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable  
but sonny is no saint  
it turns out that he has a wandering eye , which angers his wife jessie , played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett  
jessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church's youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny's church , leaving him unemployed  
sonny , letting his temper get the best of him , does something foolish , which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever  
the bulk of the film occurs in a small , predominately black church in louisiana , which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church ( "" one way road to heaven : holiness temple "" ) with an enthusiastic flock  
in this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e  f  the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church  
he asks his members to tithe , but he gives all of his money  
and his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks  
a man who can't stand to be still , he tells one of his friends , "" i quit school because i didn't like recess  "" 
in his new town he meets toosie ( miranda richardson ) , who , like him , has a family that she hasn't seen in a while  
his romance with the separated woman , like the rest of the film , doesn't follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies  
billy bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker  
his confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show's many surprising scenes , again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take  
although it probably couldn't have ended any other way , the movie does wrap things up nicely "

1,"contact is a nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagan's only novel  
it details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of a young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway ( jodie foster )  
we first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico , where she is part of the seti ( search for extraterrestrial intelligence ) project  
her research is quickly killed , however , by her highly political david drumlin ( tom skerrit ) , who disdains "" pure research "" in favor of science with "" commercial applications  
she goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s  r  
hadden ( john hurt )  
then , with that money just about to finally dry up , ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal  
in the movie's most exciting and believable sequence , ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega  
at first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers , then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before  
further decoding , with hadden's help , reveals another layer to message , containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine  
it appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens' home world  
of course , the big question becomes "" who gets to ride it ? "" 
 ( right after "" who's gonna pay for this thing ? "" )  
to boil it down , ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism , while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith  
drumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform ( apparently to keep "" godless science "" from talking to god , or something like that )  
then hadden reappears with startling news  
he has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie , in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest  
ellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream-like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels , where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father ( david morse )  
when she returns home , no one believes her  
she was not even gone for one second , they say , even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours  
her story is officially discredited , although believed by a large segment of the public ( who don't even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static  
  
  
eighteen hours worth of static )  
there is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first  
ellie arroway is a well-rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working  
neither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs , but that's a tough standard to meet  
ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures  
her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally  
drumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble  
hadden obviously has affection for ellie , but in the end he seems to see her as his creation , nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board  
even palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , ellie's love interest , takes a paternalistic interest in ellie , seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses  
the film is technically impressive , especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine  
the part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain  
the film falls apart when dealing with its central theme , the dichotomy between science and religion  
this is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved  
the film presents science pretty well ( until the end ) so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith  
religious people are presented as shallow caricatures  
rob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank ( very subtle , guys ) , the voice of the religious right "
1,"martin scorsese's films used to intimidate me  
because of his reputation , i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks  
as much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something  
i learned from scorsese's casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story  
no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies  
for example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other  
there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on  
or toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building  
again , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing  
i don't mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking  
but he simply uses the best tool for the job  
it shouldn't have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward  
the movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet  
the movie's title is another name for the dalai lama which means "" ocean of wisdom  "" 
his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story  
 ( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film's opening shot and watch where it is repeated  ) 
we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old  
his curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama  
a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before  
several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items  
the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own  
the boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama  
scorsese and long-time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk  
before selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation  
sometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice  
either way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader  
>from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama's spirit and the future leader of a nation  
it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child  
in the u  s  it might be grounds for a call to social services  
but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage  
neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable , well-rounded person  
certain patterns take shape over the years  
for example , the dalai lama is fascinated by technology  
radios , clocks , and telescopes are some of his favorite toys  
when he is old enough to accept his leadership , he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet  
he also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain , including herd animals  
it's nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter "

1,"i like movies with albert brooks , and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks  
lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies  
his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today , inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator  
you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film , while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent "" talk films "" which are finding their way into theaters  
the situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with , but even if we can't , brooks has the talent to make them comfortable , and therefore we laugh  
teenagers and jim carrey fans probably won't find an albert brooks movie very funny , but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will  
put simply , brooks' comedy is intelligent  
mother is albert brooks' latest film , and it does not disappoint  
brooks plays john henderson , a middle-aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce  
he makes an attempt at dating , but fails miserably  
he then has dinner with his brother jeff ( rob morrow ) , a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life  
jeff has a good job , a loving family , and most of all , a warm relationship with their mother beatrice ( debbie reynolds )  
after dinner , john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice , and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky-dory the dialog is  
in comparison , beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him , and john gives it right back to her  
at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john's life , she says , "" i love you , "" and john replies with , "" i know you think you do  "" 
the thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading  
it's the kind that goes something like , "" yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but     "" 
it seems as though nothing he does makes her happy  
there's always the big but  
john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self-esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner  
he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is  
 "" a great experiment "" , he calls it  
brooks' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother  
there's a scene where john has just arrived at his mother's house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the "" great experiment "" , beatrice asks , "" now explain to me again why you don't want to stay at a hotel  "" 
she still doesn't get it , and it is absolutely hilarious  
in the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh  
she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over  
when john points out the ice on the sherbet , beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze  
 "" you've named the ice ? "" 
asks john  
he's also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator , such as a twenty-pound block of cheese  
 "" the freezer was a good invention , "" says john , "" but it's not supposed to be used for everything  
that's why it's smaller than the refrigerator  "" 
it's something most of us find strangely familiar  
brooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur  
for example , in defending your life , his and meryl streep's characters are in a comedy club having a discussion  
when they're finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line , "" and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outside ! "" 
you don't know what the joke was because you couldn't hear him during the entire scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context "

1,"the laserman : somehow the title of writer-director-producer peter wang's film conjures up images of superheroes , like ultraman and spiderman  
you kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips  
as it turns out , the laserman _is_ about crime and about laser beams , but there aren't any superheroes  
instead , wang's film is populated by a group of refreshingly off-beat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot : new york city  
the laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity , eccentricity , and electricity  
the film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss ( marc hayashi ) , a chinese-american laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment  
he loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds  
arthur's professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas  
his personal life , on the other hand , is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives  
in fact , arthur is by far the blandest character in the film , despite a charismatic performance by hayashi ( the san francisco-based actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii )  
it's the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark  
arthur's not-so-typical jewish mother , ruth , for example , is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body  
she has dyed her red hair black , she takes herbal medicine daily , and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies , such as matzo balls in soy sauce--the ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine  
veteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it , almost stealing the movie in the process  
she plays ruth as a driven woman , determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture  
arthur's girlfriend janet ( maryann urbano ) is a kooky free-spirit who would rather meditate than copulate ; her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation  
arthur's best friend , joey ( tony leung ) , is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns  
joey is married to arthur's jewish sister , but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house  
arthur's 11-year-old son , jimmy , played by the amazingly adorable david chan , is--horror of horrors--bad at math ! 
he finds it impossible to meet his father's lofty expectations  
the various people in arthur's life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity  
like wang's earlier film , a great wall ( about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china ) , the laserman revolves around cultural differences  
every character in the film is , in some way or another , trying to find his identity--struggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture and the american way  
the movie also offers a provocative look at technology  
wang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu , a detective who is fed up with machines , even though he relies on them to do his job  
the film views technology with a wary eye , acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers  
wang raises the time-honored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions  
was einstein responsible for the a-bomb ? 
is arthur weiss responsible for his lasers ? 
the movie pits spirituality against technology , man against machine , and the result is a draw  
according to the film , technology has its place , but we must employ it with great forethought and caution  
ironically , by its very nature , the laserman is a triumph of technology--the technology of filmmaking  
wang's direction is exquisite , especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically cross-cuts between the various subplots , perhaps in homage to d  w  
griffith  
cinematographer ernest dickerson , who has worked on all of spike lee's films , gives the laserman a distinctive , artistic look  
mason daring's score , which includes a send-up of bach , is right on target  
the laserman is an ambitious endeavor , which is to be applauded , but it's sometimes ambitious to a fault  
wang serves up so many slices of life in the film that it's hard to digest them all  
for instance , one character ( arthur's sister ) has negligible screen time , and consequently we just don't care about her marital problems  
in weaving his web , wang has included a few too many strands  
overall , however , the laserman is a charmingly eclectic concoction "
1,"you've heard all the hype  
you've seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler's list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker  
if you've read any reviews , you've also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy  
you also may have heard that this one's too kiddie-friendly , and doesn't have enough content for adults  
believe the hype  
the effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala's sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth  
but there's something missing here , and it isn't budget or effects - it's everything money * can't * buy  
the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters  
the most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence  
he is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out  
portman's queen amidala and mcgregor's obi-wan kenobi don't fare nearly so well  
amidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life )  
and obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he's nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn's batman  
however , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job  
he also absolutely nails alec guiness' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise  
in fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that's one of the problems with this film  
i would never call myself a "" star wars "" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america  
however , if you are the one person in america who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost  
for example , one of the film's main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine  
for those of you not recently steeped in "" star wars "" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader's master in "" return of the jedi "" and "" empire strikes back  "" 
so , obviously , his appearance in "" phantom menace "" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful  
a lot of the movie is like that  
r2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it's obvious that lucas is banking on the audience's pre-existing fondness for them    
because he doesn't do much to add to it in any way  
same goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn't look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy  
even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from "" empire strikes back "" ) , and alderaan ( leia's home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in "" star wars "" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing  
what's the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? 
the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty  
there's no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be  
another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film  
i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters  
and jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast  
unlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you'll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive "" teenage mutant ninja turtles  "" 
furthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot  
oddly , this isn't just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids  
well , he's done a good job  
the hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy  
that's not jake lloyd's fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him "

1,"after watching "" rat race "" last week , i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that , when not laughing aloud , i had held a grin for virtually all of the film's 112 minutes  
saturday night , i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn't enjoy it as much the second time as the first  
 "" rat race "" is a great goofy delight , a dandy mix of energetic performances , inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness  
hands down , this is the most fun film of the summer  
the movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a '60s slapstick comedy , featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding around the screen  
then comes the setup  
donald sinclair ( john cleese ) , the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas , enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients  
to that end , he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines  
gathering together the lucky token holders , he explains , "" today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six  "" 
the competition is simple : each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city , n  m  , containing $2 million in cash  
there is a transmitter in every key , so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead  
the race has no rules ? whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money  
since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes , let's use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers  
decked out in flashy , trashy clothing and sporting big hair , vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby  
she finds that grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite , conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life  
thrown together , it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature  
owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr  ) is currently the most hated man in america  
an nfl referee , he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game  
after escaping from a vengeful cab driver , owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention  
mr  pollini ( rowan atkinson ) is a cheerful , odd little italian man on holiday in america  
he also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times  
pollini hitches a ride with zack ( wayne knight ) , a hyper-tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation  
randy pear ( jon lovitz ) promised his wife beverly ( kathy najimy ) and two kids a fun-filled vacation in las vegas  
fearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race , he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview  
beverly insists the family stay together , so they hop in the mini-van and tear off into the desert  
brothers duane ( seth green ) and blaine ( vince vieluf ) cody are young , crooked and stupid  
blaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self-done tongue piercing , and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him  
the boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal  
finally , nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) is a no-nonsense lawyer-in-training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet ( amy smart ) for the journey  
at first glance , they seem blandly wholesome , but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn ( dean cain ) and spies him swimming with another woman  
director jerry zucker ( "" airplane , "" "" ghost "" ) leaps from racer to racer , periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr  grisham ( dave thomas ) , his personality-impaired right hand man , continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers  
as with any zucker production , a few jokes fall flat , but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps  
high points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally , with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay-off  
had i been part of the filmmaking team , i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby's clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron "
1,"titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it's upsetting that it isn't  
the film , which cost $200 million+ to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it 'sunk' ( pun intended ) is a labour of love for cameron , who wrote and directed the film  
we all know that big budget dosen't mean great film ( see waterworld ( 1995 ) ) but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic  
but sadly , titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece ( although it is one of cameron's best films ) 
the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic  
they find a safe , and inside a picture of a woman  
the woman in the picture ( an old winslet ) tells the explorers that the picture is of her  
the explorers invite her over , and she then tells her story of titanic  
in the flashback , dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson , who , after winning a poker game , wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic , leaving liverpool to go to america  
also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater ( winslet ) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen't love at all , cal hockley ( zane ) so her family can remain rich  
she nearly commits suicide on the ship , but jack comes to the rescue , saves rose , they fall in love , and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them  
oh yeah , and the ship sinks  
and that is the main problem with the film , and which stops it from being a work of genius  
the story and script ( both by cameron ) are both weak  
the story is full of cliched characters , ( the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry , the poor boy with heart , the stuck-up mother ) and poor dialogue ( the script consists of lots of in-jokes of how the boat won't sink , and most of the dialogue is pretty basic ) it's a shame really , as the audience does have to sit through 3 hours of this film  
without good dialogue , a film could become a very long , very boring film ( like camerons own terminator 2 , 1992 ) but , luckily , there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear  
firstly , there's cameron's direction  
there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic , and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic  
but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end  
there is a lot of mayhem and panic , all done very well by cameron  
it's a scary sight , watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below  
thanks to cameron's direction , then , the audiences attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes  
to support the directing are the excellent cast , working very well with their underwritten characters  
dicaprio is good , although he only looks 16-17 years old  
his performance of a over excitiable , yet also well mannered boy is excellent , and he also has some funny lines  
winslet is great also , and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth  
zane is deliciously evil as cal , saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash  
the audience really does come to hate him  
he may be playing the same character he plays in every film he's in ( like dead calm , 1988 ) but he does it really , really well  
also worthy of note is kathy bates ( edward scissorhands , 1990 ) as a loud mouthed american  
finally , the icing on the 'great things' cake are the special effects  
cameron is a whiz with effects ( just watch aliens ( 1988 ) , terminator 2 and true lies , 1994 ) and they are used very well throughout  
the sweeps of the ships are awesome , although digital domain , who did the effects , cannot animate human movement too well  
the humans seem to move to 'smoothly' , there's just something odd about them  
you can tell that they have been animated on a computer  
of course , the ship sinking scenes are awesome , with bodies flying all over the place , and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed  
titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film  
titanic , then , is a wonder of directing , acting and cgi , but not writing and story  
again , like most of camerons films , the editing is loose ( cameron edits himself ) , and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts  
titanic , then , although not the godfather of movies it could of been , is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius "

1,"it has happened again  
a movie that is well scripted , well acted , and well directed  
it is involving , suspenseful    
it even has an unexpected twist at the end that packs a punch like a blow to the solar plexus  
but in order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie  
the sixth sense is that movie  
starring bruce willis ( armageddon ) as a child psychologist and haley joel osment ( forrest gump ) as a troubled youngster , the sixth sense is more spooky than scary , though it does contain disturbing images designed to startle  
eight-year-old cole sear ( osment ) sees dead people  
not just in dreams  
and not just as lifeless bodies  
he sees them walking around like regular people  
and he sees them all the time  
dr  malcolm crowe ( willis ) is trying to help him  
he recognizes in cole many of the same attributes as one of his earlier patients whom crowe failed , resulting in that patient shooting crowe before turning the gun on himself  
if crowe could manage to find a way to help cole , he believes he just might be able to put his own demons to rest  
but first he needs to gain cole's trust  
the boy is so frightened by what he sees , he has closed himself off emotionally , being unwilling to tell anyone    
not crowe , not even his own mother ( toni collette , clockwatchers )    
about his "" secrets  "" 
crowe begins to spend more and more time with him , even as his own marriage starts to dissolve around him , his wife anna ( olivia williams , rushmore ) becoming cold and distant because of his neglect of her and his preoccupation with the boy  
bruce willis underplays his role , allowing the excellent script to do most of the work of building character development  
crowe moves from treating a troubled boy who won't communicate , to treating a troubled boy who is having hallucinations , to wondering if perhaps there isn't some truth behind what the boy sees  
mr  willis does a serviceable job , letting the focus remain on the story instead of on his familiar action hero screen persona  
eleven-year-old haley joel osment manages to impress us with his performance  
he demonstrates an amazing amount of self-composure as well as an ability to play nuances in a complex character as if he were a seasoned pro  
it is fine work for one of such a tender age  
keep your eye on this young man  
the supporting cast is also quite effective  
toni collette , as the confused , frightened , and frustrated mother who can't understand what is happening to her child ; olivia williams , as crowe's once loving wife who is shutting down emotionally due to the lack of attention from her husband ; and donnie wahlberg ( ransom ) as crowe's ex-patient , now grown , who illustrates his doctor's failure to help him in the most vivid terms imaginable  
twenty-eight year old m  night shyamalan ( wide awake ) directed his own script , maintaining a proper tension throughout the film and crafting the storytelling so expertly that the film's full impact is not reached until its final moments , when a surprising revelation forces a reevaluation of all that preceded it "
1,"with the success of the surprise hit alien , directed by ridley scott , a sequel was inevitable  
in fact , after watching the first film , a sequel was wanted , particularly by this reviewer  
handing over the director's chair to recent box office gem james cameron , who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii , a surprisingly dull film , and terminator , making cameron a household name ) , the alien series got a face-lift of immense proportions  
instead of being a suspense/science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture  
what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created  
a film like aliens comes along only once in a while , and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it  
i never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have  
the terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear  
aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen  
with a science fiction plot , cameron gives aliens added testosterone , pumping up the action and fire power from the original film  
in fact , aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original  
perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero--or heroine , as the case may be  
never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film , and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character  
sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about  
placing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual , but because of weaver's presence , a woman is the only suitable hero  
aliens begins 57 years after alien ended  
lieutenant ellen ripley ( weaver ) is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened  
she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens , but "" the company "" is doubtful  
they explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left  
despite stern warnings from ripley , the company remains rigid and won't call the families back  
however , when the company loses contact with the colony , ripley's story seems much more feasible  
one of the company's directors , carter burke ( paul reiser ) , wants to gather a team to travel to the planet  
this team includes a buff private vasquez ( jenette goldstein ) , a questionable corporal hicks ( michael biehn ) , and a loyal android bishop ( lance henriksen )  
burke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony  
arriving on the planet , the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon-type environment  
the only survivor is 12 year old rebecca "" newt "" jorden ( carrie henn )  
ripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become , and she becomes newt's surrogate mother  
ripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened , and soon , all hell breaks loose  
aliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott's version , it also multiplies the number of aliens in general  
alien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member , except ripley , who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo  
aliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens , and as a result , the chills are incredibly heightened  
then again , this is james cameron , the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2 : judgment day  
he is the best action director out there ( topping renny harlin , who directed cliffhanger ) , and only he could create something as terrifying as this film  
it seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes , and aliens has the motherload  
with perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film , aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion  
i can't recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout , never dropping for a moment  
just when you think the movie is over , something else will occur , and it starts right back up again  
with a seemingly endless conclusion , aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history  
this scene is usually the one remembered most from the film , as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen "
1,"whenever writer/director robert altman works in a specific genre , he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms  
he made the west dirty in "" mccabe and mrs  miller "" ( 1971 ) , he parodied hard-boiled detective stories in "" the long goodbye "" ( 1973 ) , and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with "" popeye "" ( 1980 )  
the same holds true for his most recent film , "" the gingerbread man , "" which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years : the john grisham movie  
by the time "" the gingerbread man "" was completed , there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham  
there's no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise , matthew mcconaughey , chris o'donnell or matt damon , and it doesn't feature a great showdown in a courtroom  
instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession , "" the gingerbread man "" is a rain-soaked , southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters , a twisting plot line , black humor , a somewhat bleak ending , and even altman's trademark full-frontal female nudity  
the central character of the film is rick magruder , who is unlike any of grisham's other lawyer heroes  
he is older , experienced , and rich ; he drives a cherry-red $80 , 000 mercedes that never gets dirty , even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah , georgia , where the story unfolds  
rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife , leeanne ( famke janssen ) , and he rarely gets to see his two children , jeff ( jesse james ) and libby ( mae whitman )  
a reason is never given for the divorce , but it isn't hard to surmise that rick's womanizing had a large part in it  
whenever he's late to pick up the kids on his visitation days , leeanne always assumes it's because he's been "" screwing around  "" 
after an office party celebrating another of his court victories ( he hasn't lost in eight years ) , rick becomes involved with mallory doss ( embeth davidtz ) , one of the catering waitresses  
he drives her home because her car has been stolen , and they end up in bed together  
rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father , dixon doss ( robert duvall ) , a grungy , stringy , bare-footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers  
it was actually dixon who stole her car that night , and when rick asks why , mallory replies that he always does "" weird "" stuff like that  
as another character puts it , dixon is "" a few beers short of six-pack  "" 
rick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency  
he succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell , a private investigator friend ( robert downey jr  ) , and testimony from mallory's begrudging ex-husband , pete randle ( tom berenger )  
dixon is put in a mental hospital , but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out  
from there , the story delves into kidnapping , murder , double-crossing , and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action  
altman's cinematographer , changwei gu , gives the film a dark , soaked look  
if it isn't night-time , at least it's raining  
gu shoots the interiors , which are almost all dark wood paneling , with a minimum of light  
a great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods , which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability  
in the city there is danger enough , but when rick has to venture into the woods , you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world  
altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre , from westerns to epic dramas to comedies  
but , no matter what the genre , he is always sure to give it the altman stamp , which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings  
 "" the gingerbread man "" is no different , although his style is much more restrained here  
however , without those little touches , the film could have easily slumped into a routine action/thriller  
a great deal of the credit for the film's success can be given to the actors , especially branagh , who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction  
here , the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl , while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic  
rick is an extremely flawed man , but branaugh brings real humanity to his character  
without it , the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick's pain and frustration  
the supporting actors also put in fine performances , including embeth davidtz , who is probably best known for her heart-breaking role as the jewish maid in "" schindler's list "" ( 1993 )  
tom berenger provides some gruff comic relief , and robert duvall spends most of his on-screen time just looking weird  
it doesn't seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue , but watch him closely during the film's one courtroom scene : his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language , and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing  
while "" the gingerbread man "" isn't in league with altman's greatest works like "" nashville "" ( 1975 ) or "" the player "" ( 1992 ) , it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking , which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career "

1,"i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set , unless i'm watching a movie  
i don't even have cable , so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching "" the x-files "" every sunday night  
it's the only show that's worth an hour of my time each week ( though , since i don't watch reruns , i'm glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether )  
i am an avid fan of the show , and have been for about three years now  
and i love gillian anderson  
the x-files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off  
the film is like a two-hour episode , except that there are a lot more special effects , the plot is thicker , and the resolution is more satisfying  
this is a terrific film , both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it ( i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment )  
i expected to like it more than any episode i've seen , and my expectations were met  
actually , the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices , but , thankfully , the makers managed to do it right  
when the finale ended , the fbi branch known as the x-files had been destroyed , and our heroes , mulder ( david duchovny ) and scully ( gillian anderson ) were left stripped of five years of hard work  
the film picks up soon after ; and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building  
but wait , i'm getting ahead of myself  
the film actually opens in the ice age , about 32 , 000 years prior , during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien  
the alien's blood infects them ( fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer ) , and the story jumps into modern times , during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer  
it turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy , and mulder and scully uncover the cover-up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi  
soon , they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens  
as i've written before , it's not easy to write plot summaries for films like this , because everything needs to be a surprise  
fans of the show will know what to expect , and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film  
director rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen , making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television  
there are some truly suspenseful and well-created scenes here ( late in the film , when they're in the alien spacecraft , you'll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema )  
the special effects are very good , and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic  
what i find interesting is that the x-files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story  
our heroes are given subtle introductions ( we're not expected to know them on the outset ) , and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn't required to understand the film  
there are , of course , little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans , but i'll keep those as surprises  
it takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides , and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly  
the series is strong for a lot of reasons  
it's original ( though it has many ties to "" the twilight zone "" and owes some homage to hitchcock ) , and impressively eerie for a television show  
what really makes the series shine , however , are the actors  
duchovny has so much presence , and is just a fun guy to watch  
he has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man  
anderson is equally good , and paralyzingly beautiful ; she's also a strong actress  
both performers have acted in little more than their series , however , though i think they'll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon  
i enthusiastically recommend the x-files , both for fans and non-fans  
1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters , and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry  
it's an intelligent film , and takes you places that you might not have been ( or , at least , might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar )  
the x-files is impressive in concept , as well : fans of the series are likely to be highly critical , and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move  
it's nice to see a risk pay off for a change  
actually , it's nice to see a risk at all "
1,"when andy leaves for cowboy camp , his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys  
one of these toys is wheezy , a penguin with a broken squeaker  
woody ( tom hanks ) saddles up andy's dog and rides out into the yard to rescue wheezy  
woody succeeds in his mission , but doesn't make it back to the house before al , the unscrupulous owner of al's toy barn , recognizes woody as a rare collector's item and steals him  
buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) leads hamm ( john ratzenberger ) , mr  potato head ( don rickles ) , slinky dog ( jim varney ) , and rex ( wallace shawn ) into the city to find their friend  
meanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped  
al has collected every piece of merchandising from the 1950's tv puppet show "" woody's round-up "" except for a woody doll  
now that the collection is complete , al plans to sell woody and his round-up gang-bullseye the horse , jessie the cowgirl ( joan cusack ) , and stinky pete the old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) -to a toy museum in japan  
the gang is happy about the move ; they've been in storage for years waiting for woody  
if woody doesn't go with them , they'll be closed up in a dark box again , possibly forever  
trying to convince him to stay with them , jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up , and woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered  
while woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy , buzz and the boys invade al's toy barn , where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesn't know he's a toy  
the new buzz generates the movie's biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on "" zurg's fortress "" ( i  e  , al's apartment building )  
the original "" toy story "" won me over because its central themes reflected a grown-up sensibility rather than the usual this-is-what-we-think-kids-want-to-hear  
while most kids' movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill , in "" toy story "" buzz discovered that he wasn't special , that he was just like everyone else  
buzz sank into a suicidal depression , but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy  
in other words , it's okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life  
most of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that we're not space rangers and we're never going to be  
 "" toy story 2 "" addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie  
woody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded , abandoned , or sealed up in a dark box in the attic  
this is another big grown-up theme : everything ends  
the theme is introduced early in the movie when woody's arm is torn and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp  
on the shelf , woody meets wheezy , who's dusty , broken , and forgotten  
the other toys are shocked that woody has been "" shelved , "" and they worry that woody's ride out to the 25-cent box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt  
after he's stolen , woody has to decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with andy and his pals  
of course , in spite of the heavy themes "" toy story 2 "" explores , it's also very funny  
most of the laughs come from the toys' assault on al's toy barn and on the apartment building  
the brief substitution of a new , still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise ; i'd wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original  
most of the vocal performances are first-rate  
tom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work  
however , one voice-over also stands out as horribly miscast  
kelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector  
although he does a lot of voice-over work in commercials and on "" the simpsons "" ( as sideshow bob ) , grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice  
he doesn't have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete  
the animation is even better than in the first  
especially impressive were the textures of the figures "
1,"as i write the review for the new hanks/ryan romantic comedy you've got mail , i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet  
i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world's biggest paid commercial for america online  
and i wonder : is that so bad ? 
well , the commercial part is  
as for the movie , well , as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan , i think i'll be okay  
to paraphrase james berardinelli , whose reviews i admire very much , tom hanks and meg ryan can act  
they are both wonderful , but for all of hanks' glorious work in serious films , such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan , and his glorious triumph in philadelphia , i like him best when he's suitably obnoxious  
tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he's going to get the girl : the only question is how ? 
meg ryan , america's high school sweetheart , can act  
she's had a handful of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don't , get the movie-- fantastic )  
but , i like her best when she's , well , perky  
she is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks , they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime  
some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don't really know  
all i know is that i just like them both  
they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that's really hard to resist , and i'm not going to even try  
they're just really , really cute , sweet , and charming  
hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron , who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle  
here , the setup is a little different  
kathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children's bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her  
she is successful , beautiful , and dates a well-known columnist with very radical idea ( kinnear )  
she is also having an affair , of sorts  
you see , kathleen , with the handle shopgirl , is secretly emailing ny152  
they have a strictly un-detailed relationship : there are no specifics , and they have no idea who each other is  
ny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) , a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega-bookstores , run by his father ( coleman )  
fox books has decided to open a store on the west side , right across from a little children's bookseller named "" shop around the corner "" , run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly  
every morning , these two email each other silly , and every day , they fight "" to the death ! ! ""  
it's a charming premise , and one that works nicely , balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have  
it also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no "" let's have sex tonight "" mantra , if you'll excuse my bluntness  
this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love  
hmm  well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan "" hook up "" , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness  
you know it's going to happen , the question is now ? 
thankfully , ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two sweet kids  
it's all cute and wonderful , and for all of the idealism , it makes me feel good  
hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is  
he is , i believe , america's greatest actor  
does he show it here ? 
nah  
but he's still tom hanks , and she's still meg ryan  
which is what this movie boils down to  
it's pure confection  
all the bits about the godfather , the jokes , the superb script , it's all really sweet  
there are some immense flaws , like pacing "

1,"seen at the 21st portland international film festival 
film title : supermarket woman director : juzo itami country : japan 1997 cinematography : yonezo maeda music : toshiyuki honda cast : nobuko miyamoto , masahitko tsugawa , shiro ito , yuji miyake , akiko matsumoto super features : typical itami film    
funny and pointed in its own way  
if you don't care how and what the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket , then this film is not for you     
maybe it is better to ignore it , as this strong and biting satire , as only juzo itami can deliver , will give you an insight as to what some foods go through  
having , in the past , made films that pulled every punch imaginable , from the family traditions ( the funeral ) , to taxes ( a taxing woman & a taxing woman returns ) , to the diabolical gangsters ( minbo ) , to hospitals ( the seriously ill ) , juzo itami , this time takes on the supermarkets' own war , to get the consumers  
and while this film has its funny side , in the crazy situations that it creates , it also shows another side , which is very much the attitude of a corporate structure that is more concerned with its profits than it is with any customer  
goro has a supermarket  
and a competitor comes into the neighborhood , trying to take him out of business by providing less expensive prices for everything that is sold in the supermarket  
bargains galore , its name , has in mind the closure of goro's humbler venue , so that in the end it can mark up its prices in any way it can  
goro hires hanako , a housewife whose talents seem to be better suited to management , than they are in anything else  
hanako , as she gets familiar with the operation , discovers many of the tricks of the trade , done by many of the elders in charge of each section of the market  
and the procedures , are not always "" fresh "" food , but a new packaging and a new date , to try and convince the customers that quality is on the shelves  
hanako's ideas take hold , starting with a few of the women that work in the supermarket , being that they do not even shop there at all  
and hanako discovers along the way that a few giveaways here and there make a bit of a difference  
if not cause some serious problems in the running of the store  
a price error , forces them to give away eggs for very low prices , and causes the store a few hassles , but , it brought the people in , and everyone knows that these customers will buy a few other things  
as the operation gets stronger , the competition also has trickery up its sleeve , and it has been undermining much of the operation by paybacks to one of the store managers , as well as the meat and fish elder supervisors  
eventually these people are found out , and hanako has to tread slowly and carefully , until in the end they all have a showdown  
and here , the truth and honesty win out , and even one of the elders decides to stay rather than go to work for the corrupt opponent  
in the process , they also find that "" freshness "" ( with some very funny jokes on this word as well ) becomes a much more important tool than they imagined  
with some very nice performances , in this hectic , and fast paced film , this film gives us a sitting of two hours that is satisfying in many ways , although a failed love story between goro and hanako does not come off much , even though towards the end it is suggested  
but this would take away from the satire and its strengths  
with food gags all over the place , the film lets you have it  
and what fun it is  
worth seeing  
 ( editorial ) the director of this film , juzo itami , died shortly after the film was finished , and he left behind a legacy of comedy and satire that is rare , and uncompromising  
we would wish that he had been able to make one about film making , of which he must have had a few stories to tell , but we will have to do with much of the japanese society , and its many errant ways     
not to say that these things do not happen anywhere else    "

1,"after the press screening of "" moulin rouge , "" i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues  
everyone seemed a bit numb , understandable after sitting through a barrage of often-incongruous sounds and images  
a pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it  
another enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production , while a woman who flat-out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye  
when one fellow quietly stated "" i've never really been a fan of musicals , "" the statement surprised me because , even though the story is told almost completely through song , i didn't think of it as a musical  
there is so much going on in "" moulin rouge "" that "" musical "" seems too small a term to cover it  
 "" moulin rouge "" is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o' adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience  
australian director baz luhrmann , the man behind "" strictly ballroom "" and "" romeo + juliet , "" fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork , opulent imagery and songs ranging from "" the sound of music "" to "" smells like teen spirit  "" 
sumptuous and beautiful , vulgar and overdone , "" moulin rogue "" travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with 50 years worth of catchy tunes operates on the "" random "" setting  
oh , and it has a story as well  
 "" it was 1899 , the summer of love    
 "" christian ( ewan mcgregor ) is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris , "" to write about truth , beauty , freedom and love , "" where he encounters a group of bohemians , led by henri de toulouse-lautrec ( john leguizamo )  
christian meets satine ( nicole kidman ) , a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue , and his world transforms from black and white to technicolor  
at once fragile and vivacious , the dazzling red-haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying  
christian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well , which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession  
working with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler ( jim broadbent ) , christian writes an opus modestly named "" spectacular spectacular  "" 
zidler quickly finds a backer , the wealthy duke of monroth ( richard roxburgh ) , but there's a catch ? the duke also wants the hand of the fair satine  
as if all that isn't enough , satine has a cough , and while a cough in the real world probably indicates a cold , it rarely turns out to be anything that simple in movie land  
like a teeter-totter , "" moulin rogue "" moves up and down between the ridiculous and the sublime  
one of the loveliest moments comes as christine and satine commune outdoors at night , becoming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales  
together they dance , while serenaded by the man in the moon ( alessandro safina provides the vocals ) , apparently transported from the classic georges m ? li ? s silent film to guard the nocturnal sky  
other scenes merely traffic in everything-and-the-kitchen-sink overload  
the cavorting of toulouse-lautrec and his comrades gets strained at times and some of their overt comedy , accompanied by cartoon sound effects , is overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like "" bewitched "" beat into the ground  
of course , sensory overload was exactly what baz luhrmann had in mind  
 "" we never heard from baz to turn it down , "" one of the actors told the los angeles times  
 "" it was always , 'more ! 
more ! ' "" 
the director even sent a note to his cast reading , "" i dare you to make me say you've gone too far  "" 
the musical numbers reflect his attitude  
one knockout piece , the "" elephant love medley , "" incorporates the beatles' "" all you need is love , "" u2's "" in the name of love , "" dolly parton's "" i will always love you "" and elton john and bernie taupin's "" your song  "" 
need more ? 
how about "" diamonds are a girl's best friend "" spiced with portions of "" material girl ? "" 
luhrmann's cast offers a wide variety of approaches that , together , add up to something messy , but often wonderful  
ewan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian , emphasizing the sincerity of the love-struck poet  
mcgregor's singing voice is robust and adds vigor at just the right moments  
once labeled the "" ice queen , "" nicole kidman melts that characterization with a sizzling , yet tender , performance  
she handles the songs adroitly , although her voice sounds a bit thin in the upper range  
veteran character actor jim broadbent is suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler ? wait until you see him perform "" like a virgin  "" 
as the buffoonish duke , richard roxburgh proves to be the film's weakest link , although i'm sure he was simply following instructions  
i suspect "" moulin rogue "" will be one of those love-it-or-hate-it films  
while i didn't completely love it , i most certainly liked it a lot "
1,"in essence , good will hunting is an ordinary story told well  
taken as a whole , there's little that's special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path , leaves the audience with a warm , fuzzy feeling , and never really challenges or surprises us  
but it's intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) , strongly directed , and nicely acted  
so , while good will hunting is far from a late-year masterpiece , it's a worthwhile sample of entertainment  
like scent of a woman , which was released around this time of the season five years ago , good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world-weary veteran and a cocky young man  
the formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the characters are different  
al pacino's slade was a larger-than-life individual ; robin williams' sean mcguire is much more subtle  
and matt damon's will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o'donnell's charlie  
will is a troubled individual  
as a child , he was the frequent victim of abuse  
an orphan , he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis  
now , not yet 21 years old , he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet  
he has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box  
but he's a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems  
while working as a janitor at mit , he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building's hall blackboards  
then , one evening , his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) catches him at work  
will flees , but lambeau tracks him down  
unfortunately , by the time the professor finds him , will is in jail for assaulting a police offer  
the judge agrees to release will under two conditions : that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist  
eventually , once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man , sean mcguire , a teacher at bunker hill community college , agrees to take the case  
after a rocky start , the two form a rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor  
and , as will advances his self-awareness in sessions with sean , he also learns about friendship from his buddy , chuckie ( ben affleck ) , and love from a harvard co-ed named skylar ( minnie driver )  
the script , by co-stars matt damon and ben affleck , is not a groundbreaking piece of literature , and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation  
the characters are well-developed , however , and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles  
at one point , will comments that a session with sean is turning into a "" taster's choice moment  "" 
later , will gives a brilliant , breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith  
 ( note : since smith co-executive produced good will hunting , it's not out of the question that he had some input into this scene  ) 
director gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , to die for ) culls genuine emotion from his actors , and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes  
there's an edginess to some of the sean/will therapy sessions , and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver ( who became romantically linked while making this film ) translates effectively to the movie -- the will/skylar relationship is electric  
likewise , the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie's friendship  
many of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation , even if the overall story is somewhat generic  
matt damon , who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker , is solid ( although not spectacular ) as will  
minnie driver ( last seen in grosse pointe blank ) adds another strong performance to a growing resume ( and it's refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one )  
the outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams , whose sean is sad and wise , funny and somber  
arguably the best dramatic work in the actor's career ( alongside what he did in the fisher king ) , williams' portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination  
adequate support is provided by ben affleck ( chasing amy ) and stellan skarsgard ( breaking the waves )  
like most of what comes before it , the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable  
but meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren't always bad things in a movie , provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail  
good will hunting does both , and , as a result , earns a rating commensurate with the "" good "" in the title "

1,"i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files  
first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie  
the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable  
you have to reach for a larger audience  
therefore , the movie is quite user-friendly  
altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange  
but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on  
you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera  
in any case , the answer is no  
i am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium  
however , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie  
i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new  
everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others  
i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie  
warning : major spoilers follow ! 
please do not read to fully enjoy this movie , you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird "" hummm "" sound is all about  
you have been warned  
the x-files is what a summer should be  
exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances  
this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank  
from start to finish , this movie does not let go of you  
when i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon  
this flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes  
in fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue  
you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! 
the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid  
you know , when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? 
so yeah , the x-files is scary  
and guess what ? 
you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster  
do not think that the x-files is a monster movie  
in fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total  
no , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series  
scully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time  
she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much  
no , this is mulder's time in the spotlight  
by now , you have heard of the scene where mulder "" showers "" independence day  
if you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let's just say that due to recent events mulder should be "" showering "" godzilla instead  
to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there    who 
cares ! ? 
if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? 
the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous  
the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill "

1,"in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because , in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen-style , earnestly shallow gen-x angst pictures , it seemed to be actually about something  
it angered people , started arguments outside the theater , riled things up  
it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film  
having endured my share of the hype , i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside , and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about  
does men live up to its press ? 
well , yes it does  
and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office  
for the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment  
chad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business  
chad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder  
howard is chad's boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent  
we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge  
there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her  
the reason ? 
both men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex  
 "" it'll restore a little dignity to our lives , "" he says  
howard , helpless against the force of chad's will , agrees to the plan  
they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp  
chad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner  
howard follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham-handed and desperate  
flattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both  
you can guess which one she falls for  
soon a tragic lovers' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she's handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him  
adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ? 
in chad , writer/director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film-hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls  
his evil is as subtle as a viper's , and as easy as his smile  
we watch in stunned disbelief as he back-stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine's heart  
his character would be a joke if he wasn't so chillingly real- all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him  
he's the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness  
if one of his co-workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind  
politics is his game , and the modern cubicle-filled office is his playground  
men wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory  
the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won't describe  
the scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril  
could it happen in the real world ? 
probably not  
taken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society  
maybe it's just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience  
the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism- only the strong will survive  
the marvel of labute's multi-layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way  
but does the film work as entertainment ? 
its darned funny in spots , particularly in the men's room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions  
it works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers  
stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her "

1,"in 1987 the stock market crashed , and oliver stone's wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses  
wall street lucked out in its timing ; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had , and though its kill-or-be-killed approach to business was exaggerated , that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan-era businessman  
stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs  evil tale relayed in the fast-paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange  
critics and audiences lauded wall street , elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic  
i'm proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them  
i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone's output with its thin caricatures , obvious sentiments , and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen  
stone goes for broke in every scene ( the same could be said for nearly all of his works )  
this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions  
he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane  
it's all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity , rather than explore what these situations are really like  
i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative ( as they are presented in boiler room ) rather than laughably over the top  
these guys are salesmen after all , not televised judges  
more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street  
the only possible solution i can muster is its release date  
and not just the timeliness of the "" greed is good "" subject matter : the film was plumped down in the eighties , a decade in which the one-joke comedy rose to an art form , and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept , low result movies  
in my mind , the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies , but bad music , bad hair , and bad clothes  
maybe stone's after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace  
boiler room is an equally well-timed film with some similarities to stone's piece of crap  
they both feature a consequential father-son relationship , though boiler room's is much more subtle and touching  
and they are both concerned with the power of greed , yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery-smooth , heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street  
boiler room is a message movie as well , though ( at least until the end ) doesn't shove it in our faces  
boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash  
as i said , this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day ( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn't been seen in quite a while ) ; not only do we want to be millionaires , we want to watch other people become millionaires ! 
in our super-judgmental , power-oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything ; when you have money , you have it "" all ""  
and seth ( giovanni ribisi ) wants it "" all "" the easy way  
he's a well-intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm ( the kind that sells junk stock ) whereupon he meets others just like him  
ben affleck is cast as jim , the company headhunter , who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko  
his job is to influence trainee's into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood  
it's ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b  s that they're told to dish out to prospective buyers  
affleck's character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin's similar character in glengary glen ross , and that proves detrimental to the actor's performance  
affleck shouts , curses and be-littles his rookie employees just like baldwin , minus the edge  
when alec played the scene he became the part , spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own  
by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading  
the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks : they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game  
rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are : intellectual gangsters  
they aren't above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes  
we drink up this world along with seth , and watch him become seduced by it , just like we might be  
as in all cautionary tales , boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing , then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness "

1,"when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time  
while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good  
i'm happy to say that there's something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs  
in fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours  
the film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island  
ted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can't seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w  
earl brown ) , who's being harassed by one of the school jocks  
it seems warren's sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted's willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up  
mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom  
ted was just flattered that she even knew his name  
unfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital  
fast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn't seen since that fateful day  
with the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love  
however , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections  
there's something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin  
not exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them  
with their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you'll not only enjoy , but also won't mind talking about the next day at the water cooler  
the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers' last two films ) they almost all work  
i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on  
one minute you'll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you'll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary's apartment  
one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller  
he is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he's a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation  
ted's a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don't always work out  
it's comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top  
actually , i've liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties  
the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money  
in it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big-time bowling hustler  
it was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short-lived "" the ben stiller show "" on the fox network in late '92/early '93  
like "" the critic "" ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show's cancellation  
cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times  
however , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she's got guys just falling over each other to be with her  
heck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week  
my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn't change , and you know , it's really true  
he and ralph macchio must hang out or something  
maybe they live in dick clark's pool house  
anyway , here's another good piece of casting , as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary's heart  
the supporting performances are also good  
chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy  
lin shae , who plays mary's neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji-like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film "

1,"logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility  
considering that the skeptic's best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities , writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task  
occasionally , we get a film that does manage it  
terry gilliam's "" 12 monkeys "" was one such film  
but more frequently , we get films that don't much deal with it at all  
there is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ? 
the "" terminator "" films made up for them with exciting action , "" back to the future "" did it with an entertaining story , and the new film "" frequency "" pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own  
is "" frequency "" filled with plot holes ? 
yes  
does it matter ? 
not really  
the film opens in october of 1969  
firefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson )  
the double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective  
a strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in '69 and that john has found in the present day  
though both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom  
now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women  
frank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past  
the premise of "" frequency "" is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions  
this isn't explained ; you just have to go with it  
when frank doesn't die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way  
the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other  
sometimes frank's changing the past results in something happening right away in john's world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time  
now , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer's murders was because the change had already happened in frank's world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren't really the point  
when "" frequency "" gets cooking , it's a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing  
what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and "" frequency "" works as long as it keeps moving  
the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion  
director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure "" frequency "" as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved  
i liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward  
it actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john's advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him  
 ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself  ) 
i even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods  
some may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let's face it : it's a darn cool way to end the film  
there are enough surprises and plot twists in "" frequency "" to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant  
the other major thing to appreciate about "" frequency "" is the handling of the father-son relationship  
quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it's a rock-solid job from both actors  
the relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ? 
watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question  
the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don't believe in the characters , we don't care about the outcome of the thriller plot  
here , we do care , because we like the lead actors  
i also liked some of the supporting cast members  
elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably  
andre braugher , late of the television show "" homicide : life on the street , "" gives a nice supporting turn as frank's best friend and future colleague of john "

1,"robocop is an intelligent science fiction thriller and social satire , one with class and style  
the film , set in old detroit in the year 1991 , stars peter weller as murphy , a lieutenant on the city's police force  
1991's detroit suffers from rampant crime and a police department run by a private contractor ( security concepts inc  ) whose employees ( the cops ) are threatening to strike  
to make matters worse , a savage group of cop-killers has been terrorizing the city  
on murphy's first day of duty , after his transfer from another precinct , these cop-killers brutally murder him by shooting off his limbs one by one  
 ( orion pictures had to edit this extremely graphic scene in order to get an r rating from the m  p  a  a  ) 
after the emergency room staff at the hospital cannot save murphy and declare him clinically dead , s  c  i  
recruits his remains for their new "" robocop "" program  
using the remains of murphy's body as a foundation , their scientists build a cyborg , made of both flesh and metal  
the cyborg ( robocop ) is half human ( murphy ) and half robot ; the s  c  i  
engineers have erased murphy's memory and replaced it with a computer program ( or so they think )  
with his lightning quick reflexes , immense strength , and impenetrable armor , s  c  i  
envisions robocop as an indestructible super-cop : the solution to detroit's problems  
the remainder of the plot follows robocop's crime-foiling and vengeance on his murderers  
as a science fiction action-thriller , robocop is extremely effective  
dutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense , shocking gore , and spectacular special effects  
several sequences in the film , such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist , are destined to become cult-classics  
because robocop is so visually and emotionally rousing , it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audience--in other words , in a movie theater  
although the special effects and action are exciting , they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre  
rather , robocop stands out for its accurate and biting satire of american society  
the movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative , terrorism , board games , and television news broadcasts with air-headed anchors  
these news broadcasts , which are exceptionally clever , recur periodically throughout the movie and help to provide comic relief from the intense action and gore  
the satire in robocop , however , is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense and blood  
1990's america , as portrayed in the film , may seem far fetched but is in actuality ( i think ) only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society  
the humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible and absurd  
verhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining and enlightening piece of science fiction/social commentary  
unfortunately , robocop possesses several flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre  
the movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior , the terminator , and aliens  
robocop's main problem , aside from its dumb title , is that it does not sufficiently develop murphy's character "

1," "" dangerous beauty "" is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583  
it is beautifully filmed , wonderfully acted , and certainly nothing short of entertaining , but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness  
dealing with themes of forbidden love , religious intolerance , subordination of women , sexual freedom , and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high-cultured society , it still feels like brightly lit fluff  
the director , marshall herskovitz , doesn't want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down , so he opts for a more genial , livelier , and relatively shallow interpretation  
the film takes place during the renaissance , a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe  
at this time , venice was its own republic , and it thrived on being the central juncture of east-west commerce  
the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice , so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived  
however , there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes , their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment  
the story centers on veronica franco ( catherine mccormack ) , a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier ( rufus sewell ) , the son of wealthy aristocratic parents ( jeroen krabb ? and joanna cassidy )  
unfortunately , the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love -- rather , it was more like a business transaction , where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power , wealth , and ensure that outsiders couldn't get in  
veronica , despite her charm and good looks , is certainly an outsider  
after a short love affair , marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her  
however , because she is beautiful and intelligent , veronica has a chance to enter marco's world , albeit not as his wife  
she decides to become a courtesan -- a class of women who were as well-educated as they were ravishing , and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite  
a courtesan was not a mere prostitute ; they were afforded a special place in society , and they were greatly revered , respected , and often envied  
at one point , a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants  
veronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother , paola ( jacqueline bisset ) , who was once a famed courtesan herself  
once she enters the lifestyle , veronica finds that it suits her quite well  
she is allowed to read all the books she wants , she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry , and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet , including the awestruck marco  
their relationship develops into a playful bantering , with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marco's advances  
in many ways , their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love , and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love  
 "" love the love , not the man , "" as her mother told her  
 "" dangerous beauty , "" which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal , flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice  
it has multiple plot lines -- including veronica's adversarial relationship with a court poet ( oliver platt ) , her role in obtaining france's military assistance in venice's battle against the turks , and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition -- yet it is never confusing or overbearing  
much of the film's success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role  
known chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson's ire in "" braveheart "" ( 1995 ) , mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady  
she has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan ; her character is intelligent , witty , and both sensual and vulnerable , all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes  
the rest of the roles are also filled well , including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in "" dark city "" have assured him a solid place in hollywood  
he has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta , and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas  
oliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin , although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy  
platt is a good actor , but he's just too hard to hate  
jacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was , and even fred ward turns up in a small , but moving performance as marco's uncle  
 "" dangerous beauty "" is marshall herskovitz's sophomore directorial effort , after the overlooked 1993 film "" jack the bear  "" 
partnered with edward zwick , herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television ( "" thirtysomething , "" "" my so-called life "" ) and in the movies ( "" legends of the fall "" )  
his directing style can be best described as transparent -- it never gets in the way of the story , yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions  
he could have approached the film in any number of ways , including overdosing on the sexual aspect , which he wisely avoids  
 "" dangerous beauty "" contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic , but not so much that it seems exploitative  
herskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew , including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli , whose previous efforts include the highly-stylized thriller "" kalifornia "" ( 1993 ) and abel ferrara's dark sci-fi film "" body snatchers "" ( 1994 )  
bazelli captures the film in strong , bold colors , and be brings sixteenth-century venice to life in wide , panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery "

1,"seen april 16 , 1999 at 10 p  m  at crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n  y  ) , theater #15 , by myself for free using my hoyts' critic's pass  
[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good seats , sound and picture] 
do you realize that every time you encounter a new person you've just become part of a story ? 
everyone has their own life story , both past and present , and every time two or more interact , they become part of each others' story ( not necessarily an important or even significant part , but a part nevertheless )  
that seems to be the basic theory behind `go , ' where several characters' chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways  
in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn't usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them , such as a teenage supermarket cashier , a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors  
these types of characters might not sound all that original , but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father , a mid-level drug dealer , a narc obsessed with multi-level-marketing , horny wedding guests , a zen lovemaker , two shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out  
how they will all come together is the process the film deals with  
i'd imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators' testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general  
the film starts out as anything else , with little indication of what's to come  
we meet ronna ( polley ) , a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn't seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent  
she's not very charming , especially to her customers , but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works  
maybe this is because she's not a very afeminite character , but she's far from masculine - a creative character indeed  
things start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy , hyperactive , yet likable simon ( askew ) , an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences  
this agreement starts a three-pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug  
the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death  
nearly the same can be said for two other characters , zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) , who we don't think much of when they first appear as supporting characters , but later will become major players to the film's makeup - another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be  
once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle  
when the title screen `ronna' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene , it's clear this film isn't going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling  
considering how good it is up until that point , it's a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today  
and so the film begins to take shape , first by following ronna and her friends on a one-night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam ( who were actually looking for simon ) , which doesn't exactly go as planned , but that's what keeps it all so interesting  
the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna's story , but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead  
simon and his three friends head to ? vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined  
the third arc , about zack and adam , again overlaps with ronna's story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle  
we're shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna  
and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren't even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when they were  
i'd really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end , but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven't seen the film  
perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability , and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay , just through great filmmaking  
still , i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well : 
 ? direction : trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman , it's a great accomplishment  
he doesn't just depict a story , he wraps us up in it all , pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low  
 ? screenplay : besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general , it's clear the script has been inspired by many sources , with both obvious and subtle references , yet it never screams `rip-off  ' 
 ? tone/mood : where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream , this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre  
it's not overly-dark or twisted and the comedy isn't so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy , more like `macabre light  ' 
 ? cinematography/art direction : able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner  
 ? characterization : for nearly every character introduced , no matter what role they play in the big picture , we're able to get a sense of who they are , what they're thinking and how they came to be in their situations  
even when their actions are surprising , it never seems very out of synch  
 ? performances : every actor nails their role ( see above ) "

1,"let me open this one with a confession : i love cop movies  
i adore them with such an unwavering , near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998's one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers , steven  
was it any good ? 
well , just about as good as baldwin's steven seagal impression ( for those i've confused the answer is a resounding no ! )  
now let me clarify , i don't love just any cop movie ; i'm not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80's and now slowly ( gulp ) returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker  
i'm partial to those gritty , earthy cop dramas like serpico , donnie brasco , and the french connection  
problem is these films come along just about as often as george w  bush makes a cogent point so whenever a "" true "" cop movie does hit multiplexes , i come running towards it like an eager puppy ? ? ? and inevitably i leave , head bowed , tripping over my squiggly tail  
so what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $7  50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin-off , no ? ) ? 
truth is i'm a sucker for those barren streets , that gritty , graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops , like modern day knights , must shield us from their iniquitous clutches  
yes it's all very corny and awfully boys clubish , which , i'm guessing , is precisely where these feelings come from  
as little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe's , enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies , etc  the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies , and heighten them , turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos  
as an adult my tastes haven't changed all that drastically ; sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film , but i still delight at the promise a "" guy "" film could potentially bring  
now what if it's the cops who're the corrupt ones ? 
ooh that one really gets me going , these protectors using all that at their service , taking advantage of others for their own gain  
throw a courtroom drama ( yech ! ) 
into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city  
how absorbing is prince of the city , you ask ? 
so damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved  
the film stars treat williams , who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at  
since i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn't  
 ( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves )  
like mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn't make it to where he should have  
 ( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell )  
here , the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino's in serpico ( also directed by lumet )  
williams plays danny ciello , a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre-juliani streets of new york  
they work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes  
and that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done  
the squad relies entirely on informants ( low level junkies ) to gain access to the big wigs , and in order to obtain the info they seek , they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice  
danny has done this , and though he's a fairly honorable guy , who took the job in order to do good , his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way  
he seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a "" double agent ""  
he does so with one condition : he will not rat on his partners  
right away we know that that is exactly what he'll have to do  
and watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be  
undercover cop films are almost innately exciting , even the kind that pull out all the cliches ( like in too deep )  
how can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal , ambiguity , and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position ? 
prince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive , hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet , as well as a handful of intense performances , most notably by treat  
lumet's greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back , and lets the camera soak up the action  
his scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension , and he rarely holds for reaction shots , instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking  
lumet's worst tendency is one that many film makers ( especially oliver stone ) tend to overuse : he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension  
this isn't as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan , lumet's most recent cop \ lawyer endeavor , a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching  
though of late lumet has made several really awful career choices ( maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something ) , the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria , here he was on , sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot  
some of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic "

1,"wow ! what a movie  
it's everything a movie can be : funny , dramatic , interesting , weird , funny , weird and strikingly original  
yep that pretty much describes this movie  
it starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one of the weirdest , funniest most original movies i have ever seen  
it boggles the mind and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies like this more often  
besides being one of the best films of the year , being john malkovich may as well be one of the best movies ever  
period  
then again there are so many good movies , that one cannot pick an all time favorite  
john cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man out of a job , in search of a job  
his wife lotte schwartz who is played by a completely un-noticeable cameron diaz who looks like something off the streets is an animal lover and has about every kind of animal you could think of  
craig finds a job as a file at the 7 ? floor of a business building    you 
have to pry open the elevator doors open before it reaches floor eight , the 7 ? floor is just a floor between 7 and 8  
he is hired by his 105 year old boss ( orsen bean ) to be a filer  
in his office , he discovers a little door , to which was boarded up and hidden  
to his curiosity he opens it and starts to crawl toward it , he then gets sucked to the end and ends up in john malkovich's mind  
fifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike  
he returns to tell his co-worker maxine ( catherine keener ) that he has found a portal that will lead him into john malkovich's mind , she doesn't believe him but after she sees it it changes her mind  
lotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that being someone else is good after all  
john malkovich of course has no idea what is going on , and by the end of this bizarre film there are so many twists and turns , that we don't know what really happened  
john cusack is outstanding and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play  
he fits the role perfectly and to me was brilliantly cast  
cameron diaz is outstanding and utterly one of the world's most prettiest women , is made up here unnoticeable and very unattractive  
she however gives a very comic performance and this could easily be her best role to date  
catherine keener is very funny and sexy as maxine and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant and this movie plays big time homage ? to the master himself  
the whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart and clever  
spike jonze ( three kings ) makes his fabulous directing debut , and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film  
he lets the viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie  
by the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was  
the screenplay written by charlie kaufman was hilarious and often thought-provoking  
the film also had a soft side to it and even though the ending is very surprising it is also a little sad and heart-warming  
the whole movie was fantastic and had me rolling in the isles  
from cameron diaz's appearence to john malkovich's explorations i laughed very hard , and it may as well be as funny as as good as it gets ( the funniest ! )  
there isn't a slow point in the movie , or an overused idea  
there are no cliches except for the fact that this is the most original , inventie , witty , and smart movie i've seen in a long time  
i found myself amazed by everything : the direction , acting , writing and the whole idea of the movie  
by the end i had to wonder why hollywood doesn't want to make movies like this anymore  
or why they don't "
1,"every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody's surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling  
mtv films' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example  
did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ? 
the plot is deceptively simple  
george washington carver high school is having student elections  
tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high  
mr  "" m "" ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run  
and paul's nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons  
the dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be  
you can't help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have  
_election , a good film , does not live up to its hype  
what makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier  
the similarities are staggering : 
tracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play  
max fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play  
the most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student  
the most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student  
tracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive  
max fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive  
the male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined  
he even gets a bee sting  
the male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined  
he gets several bee stings  
and so on  
what happened ? 
how is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn't been fully formed yet ? 
even so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul's anti-social sister , tammy  
broderick here is playing the mr  rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since then  
witherspoon is a revelation  
it's early in the year , it's a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination  
and once campbell's character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you're won over  
one thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it  
there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film  
i suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less

star trek : first contact a film review by michael dequina copyright 1996 michael dequina 
star trek : first contact ( pg-13 ) anyone familiar with the series of star trek movies knows of the "" even-odd pattern "" --the even-numbered installments of the series are good while the odd-numbered ones are , well , not-so-good  
the pattern continues with the new star trek : first contact , an energetic sci-fi adventure that ( coincidentally ? ) is the eighth entry in the hugely popular series  
in this first trek feature to feature only cast members from the late star trek : the next generation television series , captain jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the rest of the 24th-century crew of the starship enterprise--commander will riker ( jonathan frakes , who also directed ) , android lt  cmdr  
data ( brent spiner ) , lt  cmdr  
geordi laforge ( levar burton ) , lt  cmdr  
worf ( michael dorn ) , dr  beverly crusher ( gates mcfadden ) , and counselor deanna troi ( marina sirtis ) --travel back to 21st-century earth while doing battle with the borg , a race of cybernetic beings that share a collective mind with the borg queen ( alice krige )  
the borg intend to alter history and assimilate all of humankind into their race--starting with the earth-orbiting crew of the enterprise and a 21st century stowaway ( alfre woodard )  
this is an interesting plotline that is sure to mesmerize trekkers everywhere and engage everyone else , but , unfortunately , it only makes up the star trek half of the script by brannon braga and ronald d  moore  
the other half of the title--first contact--refers to a subplot that takes place on 21st-century earth , where riker , troi , and laforge meet legendary scientist zephram cochran ( james cromwell ) , who is about to embark on the first warp speed flight in human history , which directly leads to the first contact with extraterrestrials  
while this story does tie into the main plot and pays off interestingly in the end , it is nowhere near as involving or exciting as the borg battles on the enterprise  
not helping matters is the tiresome cochran character , an eccentric whose drunken schtick starts out funny but becomes too one-note after a while  
in the end , though , the first contact subplot doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the film as a whole  
the story is typical sci-fi fantasy , but the conviction of the cast--most notably the always-phenomenal stewart--makes you believe and care  
frakes , making his feature directorial debut , keeps the action swiftly rolling along and delivers the action goods , even upping the violence a notch ( this is the first trek film to bear a pg-13 rating ) to greater effect  
st : fc has a bigger budget than the last trek outing , the middling star trek generations , and it definitely shows on screen--the production design and especially visual and makeup effects are outstanding ( in particular those involving the borg queen )  
braga and moore's mostly sharp script will please both trek devotees and the rest ; the references to the borg storyline in the tv series , the continuity with the previous film ( e  g  
the ongoing saga of data's emotion chip ) , and a fleeting star trek : voyager crossover will make trekkers squeal with delight , but such points are made easily accessible to those less familiar to the trek mythos  
paramount was reportedly worried about the staying power of its trek franchise with the next generation cast now carrying the helm  
based on the entertaining success that is star trek : first contact , i'd say the studio has nothing to worry about ( at least not until this cast retires and the crew of the wan star trek : deep space nine takes over    ) "

1,"what's shocking about "" carlito's way "" is how good it is  
having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino's previous film , "" scent of a woman , "" and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one ( he had just won an oscar ) , "" carlito's way "" was destined for underrated heaven  
that's what it is : an underrated gem of a movie  
and what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it , and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study  
 "" carlito's way "" deals with , well , carlito brigante ( pacino ) , a puerto rican ex-drug kingpin , who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke-addicted , curly-haired lawyer ( sean penn ) points out a legal technicality  
of course , carlito was actually awoken in prison , and has decided to go straight , even if he's really a crook at heart  
carlito , like barry lyndon , is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn , and can't escape into something he is not  
carlito's attempts at a clean , legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn  
when he first gets out , a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot-out , where he has to kill a couple people to survive  
he's constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he's doing anything illegal , and his lawyer finds himself neck-deep in a pile of shit , needing him to try and help him out , which includes him doing some prison breaking  
carlito , like ratso rizzo , wants to go to miami ( since , according to film logic , that's where it's at ) , but needs some funding  
being a legend , he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club ( this is the 70s , by the way , and since some of this takes place in night clubs , we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics , including several k  c  
and the sunshine band tunes - my personal favorite )  
he gets a bodyguard ( the great luis guzman , at his best ) , and is soon running a pretty good business , even if he's constantly attracting underworld young thugs , like benny blanco "" from the bronx "" ( john leguiziamo ) , who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito  
on the other side , the symbol of promise and hope , is gail ( penelope ann miller - what happened to her ? ) , his girlfriend from before prison  
she's a goregeous ballerina , and a stripper , and soon carlito is trying to get back with her , and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami  
while this relationship is never fully defined or anything , we get a sense of love between them , and they have some truly interesting scenes between them ( she never gives him addresses or locales - he always has to track her down )  
all of these elements clash together at the end , in a brilliantly executed , emotional climax , which is inevitable  
when i say inevitable , i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack , putting a great spin on it  
sure , it's going to eleveate some of the tension , but it gives the film a lot of depth , as carlito is seen trapped by fate  
what's amazing is the big chase sequence ( amazingly done by de palma ) has a lot of tension and thrills  
like "" apollo 13 , "" we know what's going to happen , but we're still thrilled by what happens in the middle  
it's also very emotional , thanks to a great script by david koepp , and amazing performances by pacino and miller  
de palma is famous ( or infamous ) for lots of violence in his films  
his earlier flim , "" scarface "" ( which starred pacino in the lead ) , has a ton of it , especially at the end ( and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i'm still not over )  
but de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes  
to me , the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building , looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet  
this is the most brilliantly done , and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film , and probably the best in de palma film history  
with a gorgeous soprano duet in the background , and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito's head , and a saddened , remorseful look on pacino's face , it's a tear-jerker ( well , for me , i dunno about you    )  
the acting from all is great , especially from the three leads  
pacino was panned for his performance , chiefly because his accent wasn't puerto rican enough and , well , it wasn't as "" strong "" as his oscar-winning role in "" scent of a woman  "" 
well , his "" scent of a woman "" performance was great and all , but it was nothing really but , as comic kevin pollack said , a "" foghorn leghorn impression  "" 
in "" carlito's way , "" he's emotional , and strong , despite the fact that he's remorseful over his entire lifestyle , which he cannot change  
i felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tango-dancing , insult-throwing blind guy in "" scent of a woman  "" 
as i said , penelope ann miller is great , and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry "

1,"i know that "" funnest "" isn't a word  
 "" fun "" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective  
but that's the word that came to me right after viewing "" chicken run  "" 
no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like "" that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! "" 
so to hell with webster's -- "" chicken run "" is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while  
i can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner  
the chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something  
living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box  
one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer  
rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs  tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan  
she orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , "" chickens go in ; pies come out  "" 
what sort of pies ? 
chicken pies , of course  
co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : "" creature comforts , "" "" the wrong trousers , "" and "" a close shave  "" 
the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures  
part of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new  
 "" the wrong trousers , "" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and "" a close shave "" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories  
but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived  
now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in "" chicken run  "" 
the plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement  
thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done  
part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? 
park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is  
but they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us  
another thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing  
there are references to "" the great escape , "" obviously , and "" stalag 17  "" 
the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both "" raiders of the lost ark "" and "" indiana jones and the temple of doom  "" 
there's even a nod to "" the blues brothers , "" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history  
the "" braveheart "" reference is a hoot if you catch it  
when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , "" chicken run "" is downright brilliant in its execution  
consider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of "" blair witch project "" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online  
out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome  
why ? 
because once you got past the thought that "" they're parodying that 'blair witch' movie , "" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose  
they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing  
conversely , "" chicken run "" doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene  
if you've never seen "" indiana jones , "" the chase sequence is still fun  
even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character  
park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , "" chicken run "" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either  
enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , "" chicken run "" is that much richer  
the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them  
ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on "" absolutely fabulous "" ) nails it "

1,"a couple of months ago , when i first downloaded the face/off trailer from the net , my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold 'yawn'  
followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key , not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss-poor trailer  
then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u  s      unique    excellent     must-see  
well , i thought still skeptical , i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here  
'here' , of course , was still three months away  
i'll admit , when i trotted off to see this film , the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow  
i'd heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled , but his films were definitely not on my must-see list  
that , let me tell you , has changed completely  
i knew this fact only five minutes into the film , after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet  
the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick  
seriously  
i've never been a big john travolta fan , but he , like cage , perfectly suited his role in the movie      sorry , 
make that 'roles' in the movie  
even travolta's great performance , however , paled in comparison to cage's character portrayals  
my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler's hideout  
half drugged out of his mind , he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his son's death from castor's perspective - "" doesn't it just break your heart  "" he mutters coldly  
now don't go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie - it's not  
that's what really makes this movie unique  
it's an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters   "
1,"screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker  
screenplay by andrew kevin walker  
inspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving  
directed by tim burton  
starring johnny depp , christina ricci , and casper van dien  
special appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken  
synopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation  
townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them  
cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery  
comments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years  
batman , of course , is perhaps his best-known film and led to a string of less successful sequels  
he's done biographical work ( on the director ed wood ) , children's movies ( nightmare before christmas ) , and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! )  
sleepy hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies  
sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international's series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe  
christopher lee , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders  
the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s  
one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein  
i mention these allusions for a reason  
seasoned horror film fans , including myself , will smile at their inclusion in this film  
with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies , especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade ) , we needed a film like this  
not only does it have a sense of history , but burton's skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror  
the film's eerie landscapes and foggy towns , indeed , overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie  
johnny depp , a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands , plays ichabod crane , who has apparently changed occupations from irving's original story and is now an investigator  
depp is adequate in his role  
no more ; no less  
equally adequate is christina ricci , who plays the love interest in the film  
she's a good witch too  
how cute  
one of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters  
the two actors , however , carry the movie well enough , but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine  
veteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough ( who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks ) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers  
while i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points , i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing  
you have to pay attention  
andrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay  
he's the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven  
walker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood , and sleepy hollow certainly doesn't hurt his growing reputation  
as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker , sleepy hollow is quite graphic  
there's a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings  
this is definately not a flick to take the young kids to "

1,"i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live-action-disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins , separated at birth by divorcing parents , never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again  
and everyone should know how i feel about remakes , especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you're going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea )  
this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list , and was actually quite the opposite  
contemporary live-action-disney films are not one of my favorties , anyway : they're usually unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10  
this one , however , is shockingly not bad  
in fact , it's actually good  
not the original good , but what's great about it is that it doesn't necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining  
because it's cute and innocent fun  
because it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with  
because the lead star is immensely appealing  
because the parents are also immensely appealing  
and ( i'm repeating myself ) because it's cute and innocent fun  
there's nothing too risque about it , save the plot ( the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish , but that is precisely the point of the movie ) , and it's aimed directly at either kids , adults who want to remember the original , or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid  
i , personally , am somewhere between the second and third  
i can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn't so weird or diverse ( the names godard and kubrick weren't even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc's "" wonderful world of disney , "" where they'd show you a live-action and/or made-for-tv disney flick an hour per week  
i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films ( like "" lady and the tramp "" and "" pinnochio "" )  
and , most sadly , i remember every single christmas , without fail , there were a barage of children's animated half-hour shows , made exclusively for the christmas season , that i wouldn't dare missing  
i can even remember seeing the made-for-tv "" parent trap ii "" on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the original "" parent trap  "" 
it's more of a late childhood movie , because it deals with the issue of divorce , but it deals with it in a disney-ized version  
it's playful , and witty , and charming , and if i saw it for the first time right now , having never experienced that part of my childhood , i'd probably dismiss it  
i'd probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn't seen the original at such a perfect age  
watching it , i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film , and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly-perfect parents splitting up , and how it affected my adolescence  
and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke , and pointed out that even in the most fucked-up of situations , things could always work out if you , well , manipulate things a bit , at least for the better  
this new version did that for me , but it's also charming in its own way  
it has a new cast , a contemporary feel , and , for the first time in awhile for a live-action-disney flick , a tone that isn't corny or condescending , but just right  
the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way  
and for the first time since the original film , the kids actually know better than the foolish adults  
the story is basically classic by now , repeated almost as many times as kurosawa's "" the seven samurai "" : a pair of twins ( played here by lindsay lohan , just like they were played by hayley mills in the original ) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents  
one , annie , is sent to live with the mother ( natasha richardson , resembling her mother , vanessa redgrave , more than i had ever noticed ) in london , where she lives with her parents and her devoted , foppish butler ( simon kunz ) , as she works as a swingin' fashion designer  
she grows up refined and classy , but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker-playing  
the other , hallie , is sent to northern california with her father ( dennis quaid ) to live on a vineyard with their pseudo-maid ( lisa ann walter ) , and grows up rugged yet charming  
they both meet at the same camp , one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged  
they feud because they look all-too similar , and are thus in tight competition , which results in some nasty pranks , which winds them in seclusion together in a private , out-of-the-way cabin  
there , they become friends , then learn about eachother  
once they know everything , they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent , whom they've only heard of  
they learn about eachother's lives in detail , they make sure they look alike ( which requires hair cutting and , notoriously , ear-piercing - a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in "" pulp fiction "" ) , and when the end of summer comes , they switch and hope for the best  
lindsay lohan doesn't necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original  
but she comes off just as appealing as she did once  
she does , though , add a couple new things : she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original , respectively "

1,"people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies  
often science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller  
in such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked  
but , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic  
such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman  
the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits  
but the right stuff film isn't even fiction  
it was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program  
the plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes  
the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier  
many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado  
but one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records  
ten years later , soviets have launched "" sputnik "" marking the beginning of the space age  
in order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space  
best air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image  
in one of critics' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s  
such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman's film looks quite atypical for its time  
with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life  
but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker  
philip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies  
the right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking "" artsy "" projects  
the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film  
the plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts  
the film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece  
that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles  
sam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty  
on the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases  
shepard's performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn  
young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward  
always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard  
kaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots' wives  
royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b  johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch  
great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman's superb direction  
most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time  
the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline  
everything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world  
in that setting , it's quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights  
but the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and "" natural "" pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots "

because thats all that there really is     
i found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot  
for one thing , a white leading actor who has a black daughter does leave some curiosity     
i am not saying that this isn't possible   
but it does leave one to wonder    i 
know i did  
another thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out     
and certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations  
there was one scene that should have been short    
but it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking   
ok enough already get on with it  
there are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do    
things just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort    
another thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning  
this movie is also very predictable    
you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment  "

if you only remember one thing about fair game , it should be that it singlehandedly proves crawford should stick to the sports illustrated swimsuit issues  
if you thought kathy ireland was laughable in alien from l  a  , you'll change your mind when you see fair game  
ireland would win handfuls of oscars if this was her only competition  
in a real casting coup , crawford plays a super-intelligent lawyer ( in a jogging bra , of course )  
we all know this is a stretch , the only legal opinion crawford has ever put forth being that she favors the death penalty for anyone who wears white after labor day  
nonetheless , someone out there thought she'd make a good lawyer , but we're reminded of her true function in the movie when she takes two showers in a period of twenty minutes  
and for you horny teenage boys out there , you actually get to see her topless for two seconds in the dark    
come to think of it , that may have been a body double  
cindy crawford isn't black , is she ? 
like i said , crawford is a lawyer with a bunch of russians after her  
billy baldwin ( or is it stephen ? 
alec ? 
adam ? 
kim basinger ? ) is the police detective who has to save her life , time after time , chase after chase , explosion after explosion  
there's absolutely nothing original about this movie  
it's every cop show of the 70's mixed with every action thriller of the 80's and every technology- exploitation movie of the 90's  
three decades of crap all in one place , driven further into the ground by crawford's complete lack of acting talent  
and it's all completely predictable  
you know the mistakes baldwin and crawford are going to make before they make them , you know when the "" sexual tension "" will finally end up in them consummating the relationship , you know when the villains will capture crawford so baldwin has to rescue her in the climax and you know the movie's going to suck from the first scene  
the plot isn't really explained until the end  
all we know is these russians have every detail about crawford in their computer  
in the words of one of the villains , "" we even know what size pantyhose she wears  "" 
 ( yeah , you and every 14-year-old boy in america  ) 
he goes on to add , "" we know more about her than she does  "" 
 ( _that_ i find very easy to believe  ) 
i hope you enjoyed those two sample dialogue quotes , because i wrote down plenty of other bad ones ( "" if it weren't for me , you'd still be pulling bananas out of your ass in cuba ! "" ) 
because , you see , fair game is not only a showcase for recycled action cliches and terrible acting , but also some seriously bad dialogue  
it all adds up to a really terrible movie that made me laugh in plenty of places i wasn't supposed to and grimace in places i was supposed to laugh  
one more thing fair game has against it is some awful comic relief  
would you laugh at a scene where crawford tortures a computer nerd with double entendres like "" i'm very interested in _hard_ware "" and other crap about playing with his joystick ? 
i wouldn't , but not because i'm a computer nerd  
it's just not funny  
crawford's only contribution to the information age are a few gif files floating around with her head on a nude traci lords' body    
or was it jack lord's body ? 
i'll leave you with the final line of dialogue in the movie  
the boat with all the russians has just blown up and baldwin and crawford are floating on a life raft  
crawford says woodenly , "" that was my client's boat you just blew up  
i'm filing a lawsuit against you "

the preceding has been the plot of approximately twelve thousand and six action films ; this one just happens to be called metro  
i have learned to expect little from films like metro , and consequently i am bored by them more often than i am genuinely disappointed  
with eddie murphy on board , however , you hope for something extra , some kind of spark  
when a film makes watching eddie murphy a tedious experience , you know it is doing something terribly wrong  
murphy stars as scott roper , a hostage negotiator for the san francisco police department who is exceedingly good at his job  
with his personal life , he is considerably less successful , facing an unhappy ex-girlfriend named veronica ( carmen ejogo ) , a gambling problem and a mountain of debt  
then his professional life gets a jolt as well when a friend and colleague ( art evans ) is murdered while investigating suspected jewel thief michael korda ( michael wincott )  
finding korda becomes very personal to scott , and he joins with new partner kevin mccall ( michael rappaport ) to foil korda during an attempted heist  
but all is not well even with korda in jail , as scott , veronica and kevin all continue to face life-threatening danger  
metro ( the title , in case you are wondering , means absolutely nothing ) is so badly put together that even the most casual viewer may notice the miserable pacing and stray plot threads  
in the first place , korda's rage over being discovered before he can make his big score is rendered completely pointless when he proceeds to hit the target anyway ( and , incidentally , to screw it up )  
a reference to payoffs in the police department , followed by a conspicuous decision to keep scott off the korda case and a couple of pointed glances , is dropped abruptly with no resolution after about forty-five minutes ; even the relationship between scott and new partner kevin is so perfunctory , with kevin disappearing entirely after taking a bullet for scott , that you may yearn for bickering buddies  
worst of all is a plot structure which places the main villain ( the always menacing michael wincott ) behind bars for far too long , leaving a lot of time to kill with the tedious reconciliation of scott and veronica  
you can't blame murphy for being unable to muster any enthusiasm for the scenes with his bland leading lady , but he should have known better than to take this role at all  
scott roper exists in an uncomfortable middle ground between the kind of street-wise fast-talker murphy has built a career on and an actual three-dimensional character , and murphy is never able to reconcile the two  
the script seems to have been doctored for him , with a gambling problem turned into a bit of character color and his supposed inability to form relationships turned into a cause for gags rather than actual conflict , yet there is still too little comedy for murphy to work with  
for much of the film , he walks around with an intense frown , and it is over 90 minutes into metro before you hear that trademark laugh for the first time  
murphy is stranded with too few solid punch lines , and nearly all of the ones he does have bounce of ejogo and fall to the ground limply  
i suppose i should give director thomas carter credit for taking the obligatory san francisco car chase ( how much do you want to bet on the likelihood of seeing a car soar over a hill ? ) and doing a few interesting things with it  
as vehicles are sent flying and passengers sent sprawling by a runaway cable car , it is possible at least for a moment to take some pleasure in a goofy spin on a familiar situation  
carter does an even better job by taking that old suspense stand-by -- the medicine cabinet mirror which will close to reveal a killer standing behind someone -- and using it to defuse tension not once , but _twice_  
the fact that carter was able to demonstrate even that much recognition of cliches , and a willingness to subvert them , makes his involvement in the rest of the disaster that is metro all the more puzzling  
an action film like this plods so relentlessly and obviously from point a to point b to point c that you might find yourself shouting out "" point c ! "" while they're still getting to point b , or getting up with the rest of the audience after the big explosion which signals that nothing else of any consequence is going to happen "

soldier a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman 
the warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body  
jungian archetypes , these two opposites need each other to create a whole , but it's difficult to integrate both  
often we'll encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and , with the help of jung's magician , sit around imagining grand schemes  
without the drive to manifest their plans , much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness , all they have are dreams  
warriors on the other hand , are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat , and will do combat with every last bit of their energy  
they don't care enough about anything to know what's worth fighting for : gladiators who live only for the battle  
this dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know , but can also illustrate societies  
america during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers  
todd 3465 ( kurt russell ) is a living , breathing archetype  
chosen from birth as a soldier , he is raised by the government to be a killing machine  
his childhood is cruelty and competition  
he is indoctrinated with the big rules  
never question authority  
winning is everything  
strength beats knowledge  
a veteran of numerous intergalactic wars , todd is 40 and he's obsolete  
a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger  
left for dead after a test battle with the best of the new killers , caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) , he's unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234 , a garbage world  
obviously our hero is still alive  
he finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health  
when the peace-loving colonists get a good look at who todd is , they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world  
they are the other good guys  
these lovers find that they need a warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons  
todd finds himself in the role of protector  
what could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultra-right wing future is ruined by turning the film into a cartoon  
the effects are mostly second-rate explosions or jerky slow motion  
the plot is old hat  
we don't get even a glimpse at the society that created the soldiers  
hardly anything makes sense  
the film's science fares badly  
with all the remarkable advances we've made in just 37 years ( the film takes place in 2036 ) , we're still stupid  
after conquering the stars , for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it to a landfill light years away  
even stranger , the garbage barges appear to double as time machines  
virtually all the trash is vintage 1960  
there is nothing in the story that is not predictable  
the first thing that todd sees after coming back to life is sandra ( connie nielsen ) , the woman just a little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care of him  
it doesn't take a genius to foresee that her husband isn't going to be around much longer  
is it a shock to find out that the film's climax is an unarmed battle between todd and caine ? 
who would you guess wins ? 
some of the scenes would work if this were a comedy  
todd's first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connie's nipple poking through her thin blouse "

-1,"the first image in "" final fantasy : the spirits within "" is a computer-animated close-up of a human eye  
it's a beautiful piece of work , remarkably detailed and quite convincing  
when the picture pulls back to reveal the owner of the eye , however , things change  
the young woman has mesmerizing hair , although it hangs too artfully ? even by movie standards ? to be believed  
the facial features are more detailed than any computer-animation seen to date , but the result is more reminiscent of a very well-crafted doll than anything human  
she is pretty , but bland , and not nearly expressive enough to come off like a person  
all the characters in "" final fantasy "" are like that  
of the core group , the younger white men and women are all athletic , attractive and indistinct , like applicants for a tv reality show  
the black man is taller and burlier , and the aging scholar is bald , with wrinkles and a beard  
none of them appear to be based on individuals ; they all look like the products of general descriptions given a police sketch artist  
it gets worse when they talk and move  
why is the sarcastic voice of steve buscemi , he of the great twisted face and snaggleteeth , coming out of the mouth of some dreary ken doll ? 
why , for every fluid physical gesture , do we also see herky-jerky puppet-style motions ? 
more to the point , who decided a full-length computer animated movie featuring "" hyperreal "" ( their term , not mine ) humanoids was a good idea ? 
 "" final fantasy "" is based on a phenomenally popular video game i've never played , with a story straight out of japanese anime , which more often than not leaves me bored and depressed  
if you're a fan of either , please spare me your letters , as i will focus solely on the finished film and not its source materials  
with an expression-challenged cast , "" final fantasy "" mixes turgid action scenes with heaps of mystical shit  
the result is ugly , confusing and boring  
note : the following reveals the basic plot  
if you want to have a fighting chance of making any sense of the movie , i suggest you read it  
earth is at war with aliens that appear to feed on human souls  
most of our planet is devastated , with humans living in a few protected cities  
while the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies , aki ross ( voiced by ming-na ) and her mentor , dr  sid ( donald sutherland ) , believe in a more organic approach  
they operate on the notion ( quoting straight from the press kit ) "" that all life forms have signature spirit waves that can be identified and contained  
aki and dr  sid collect a series of organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined will form a wave of equal and opposite intensity to the spirit wave of the alien force  
the waves will , in effect , cancel each other out and disarm the foreign contagion  
they have collected six of the eight key spirits needed to complete their wave  
they are on a desperate hunt to find the remaining two spirits before their time runs out  "" 
are you still with me ? 
there's only a little more  
aki is infected with the alien force  
dr  sid has developed a method of confining the contagion and keeping it from killing her , but the defense wall won't hold much longer  
already , the alien is communicating with aki through her dreams  
aiding aki and dr  sid are the deep eyes , a group of hard-as-nails types that would have felt at home with the troops in "" aliens  "" 
capt  gray edwards ( alec baldwin ) heads the task force that consists of a wise guy ( buscemi ) , a tough woman ( peri gilpin ) and a gentle giant ( ving rhames )  
throwing a monkey wrench into the plans is the requisite dumb ass : in this case general hein ( james woods ) , who wants to use the zeus cannon to bomb the aliens back to the stone age , even if it destroys earth as well  
so there you have it  
like most of the anime i've seen , the plot combines apocalyptic settings , lots of shooting and fuzzy spirituality , all wrapped up in a save-the-earth bow "
-1,
-1,"absolute power , the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood , attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff  
it is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper  
one can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood  
not only is the plot unbelievable and contrived , but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence  
continually underestimating the audience , the film gives us information we already know or dont even need  
details essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying ( like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two night-vision goggles in their car ? )  
oddly enough , the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities  
a masterful jewel-thief ( played by clint eastwood ) witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire ( played by e  g  
marshall )  
while robbing one of marshalls mansions , he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault  
there , through a two-way mirror , he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay  
their game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman  
in self defense , the woman grabs a letter-opener and stabs the man in the elbow  
she raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men  
the man ? 
he is the president of the united states of america  
where does the film go wrong ? 
it cannot be the acting  
clint eastwood , ed harris and gene hackman as the president give type-cast , but decent performances  
the cinematography is sufficient ; wild and erratic during action sequences , dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes , and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue  
even the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thriller/suspense genre  
the fault clearly lies in the screenplay , and the screenplay alone  
while setting up a story about misuse of power , about the true possessors of that power , and about intrigue and double-crossing , it does not resolve it  
not one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax  
rather , the tense situations are left dangling at the end , giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness  
an example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene : in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood , the police have set up a trap at a small restaurant  
police officers are everywhere , incognito of course  
at the same time , not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives  
all three parties are unaware of each others presence  
this scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood , who might suspect this is a trap , will get himself out of this difficult position  
he will probably have a brilliant plan , involving ingenious preparations  
however , when he arrives at the trap , both hit men miss ( how convenient ) and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away  
the buildup of this scene took about ten minutes  
ten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap  
the scene was resolved in less than 20 seconds    
parallel to the story line of catching the real killer is a cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter  
the daughter blames her father for never being there for her , because he was either in jail or robbing a house somewhere  
of course their relationship takes a turn for the better during the adventure and they end up a happy family "

-1,"mr  nice guy is the latest jackie chan film , so you should know what to expect  
a weak plot , terrible dialogue , very little acting ability , but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile  
however , mr  nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie's best efforts , and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever  
jackie chan plays , who else , jackie  
this time out , he's a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show  
not that it ever makes a difference in the plot  
there are only two scenes of him cooking  
for the rest of the film , somehow he mutates into jackie chan , supercop  
it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills    perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ? 
a tv newswoman , diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs , the demons  
although she only has one camcorder , somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles    hmmm , 
shades of broadcast news ? ? ? 
anyway , the goons discover diana , and will do anything to recover the tape  
here lies another crucial flaw in the story : doesn't anyone realize you can copy a tape ? 
oh well , no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense  
as luck would have it , diana runs across jackie , and , wouldn't you know it , jackie accidentally ends up with the tape  
this leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie  
in a move apparently designed to woo american ( and other english-speaking ) audiences , the film uses english as its primary language  
however , that doesn't mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie's recent americanized releases  
strangely , many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english , and poorly too  
whether this is just a very bad case of looping , an effort to minimize accents , or a simple case of nostalgia , it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie's dubbed films  
the plot in mr  nice guy is negligible , merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons  
but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie's films , it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread  
look , if you have jackie chan playing a chef , why not use that to your advantage ? 
watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts  
the action is a mixed bag here  
there's really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie's films  
it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site , apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan  
the action in the film is neither jackie's best nor worst , but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes  
the film's gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting  
once or twice , it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence  
but to slo-mo jackie running ? 
either this is a nod to the six-million dollar man , or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down  
if you've seen all of jackie's films and are in need of another fix , go ahead and see mr  nice guy  
however , if you're just in the mood for some good action , you'd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work , such as supercop "

-1,"it's time to take cover  
after a hiatus of about fifteen years , the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest  
in early 1997 , there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone , one on television and two in the theaters , with dante's peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar  
of the two , i had heard that dante's peak was the better film , so i decided to check it out when it was released on video  
the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town  
the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption  
flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky , crushing homes and people  
we see people panicking , people crying , and even horses rearing  
it is a disaster of biblical proportions , signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road  
symbolism doesn't get much more blatant than that  
we learn that harry dalton ( pierce brosnan ) , a volcanologist with the u  s  geological survey , was there with his wife when the eruption occurred  
harry survived , but his wife did not  
a few years later , harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante's peak , washington ( which , we are told , has been voted second most desirable place to live ( under 20 , 000 ) by the readers of money magazine )  
there harry meets rachel wando , a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante's peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop  
although the mayor doesn't seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up , a few members of the city council are  
they are afraid that harry's presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante's peak  
they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug  
however , when an amorous young couple takes a skinny-dip in the local hot springs , they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath  
thus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption  
this film contains a number of cliches  
the amorous couple is one  
as soon as they doff their clothes , you know they're going to die  
the town busybody and the abrasive mother-in-law make appearances , as does the death-defying dog  
countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable  
watching the movie , i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements , but some of the dialogue as well  
unfortunate , since much of the dialog is terrible  
for example , harry's boss , paul ( charles hallahan ) , and a team from the u  s  geological survey join harry to assess the situation  
paul basically tells the townsfolk that harry's eruption predictions aren't cause for alarm  
this causes harry to leave in a fit of rage , only to turn up the next day , ready for work  
when paul asks harry why he stayed , he says with grim determination , "" cause this town's in trouble and i'm the best man you've got  "" 
even better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving  
he likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water  
if the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up , however , the frog won't move and will allow itself to be cooked  
 "" is that your recipe for frog soup ? "" 
asks one of the team members  
 "" it's my recipe for disaster , "" responds harry "

 "" don't believe the hype  "" 
this michael douglas vehicle , from the director of "" seven "" , isn't nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe  
the film draws us in with an intriguing concept ( aided no doubt by the riveting trailer ) where a jaded millionaire ( douglas ) is presented with the opportunity to enter into a living fantasy  
this isn't simply virtual reality  
this is real life with a deadly twist  
on his 48th birthday , nicholas van orton ( douglas ) is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother , conrad ( sean penn )  
conrad has a special birthday present for his brother  
he hands nicholas a gift certificate and tells him to contact a company called consumer recreation services  
 "" they make your life fun , "" conrad tells him  
nicholas humors his brother , telling him he'll call , but it's clear he has no time for any foolish , "" fantasy role-playing , "" as he calls it  
then , for reasons that are never really made clear , nicholas decides to go to crs and see what they're all about  
he ends up spending a whole day going through their screening process , which to me made no sense considering the tight schedule he keeps claiming to have  
nevertheless , when it seems nicholas has been rejected as a crs client , the weird things start happening  
of course , when we've only covered about 30 minutes of screen time , what else should we expect  
douglas has built his modern career around playing powerful , violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands  
one of those films , "" basic instinct "" , came from the creative minds of writer , joe eszterhas and director , paul verhoeven  
the premise of "" the game , "" is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film , "" total recall  "" 
in that case , the premise was implanting someone else's memories as a way to enhance one's own life through a dream vacation  
yet , in both films , the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the audience  
we live the adventure along with the protagonist , reacting to each twist and turn  
in theory , the key to the suspense is not being to tell what is real and what isn't  
all we can do is hang on until the end of the ride , when the truth is finally revealed  
now , for those of you who forgot , let me say this again  
 "" don't believe the hype  "" 
 "" the game "" is not a thrilling roller coaster ride  
as a suspense-thriller , it doesn't do much but spin in circles  
by the third reel , i was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as i endured the predictable plot  
is it any wonder douglas won't be able to resist the charms of a mysterious , potentially life-threatening blonde ( ever heard of glenn close ? 
no ? well , how about sharon stone ? 
thought so )  
if anything in this film surprises you at all , i would guess you haven't seen that many films  
there is no suspense here  
trust me , i looked hard to find some  
i had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations  
fincher aim's for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas  
there are those that might say "" the game "" is not intended to be viewed literally  
i would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film  
the film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues  
there is a moment early in the film where van orton , realizing his game has begun , smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out who's in on the whole thing  
he is charged by his paranoia "
-1,"first troy beyer wrote the critically panned "" b  a  p  s  "" 
now she makes her directorial debut , writing , directing , and starring in this sub-par film about women talking about sex  
though not without redeeming qualities , this film is bad  
the basic story follows three single friends -- jazz ( beyer ) , lena ( randi ingerman ) , and michelle ( paget brewster ) -- in their search for love  
jazz has an idea for a local talk show ; it would feature women talking about sex and dating  
she and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami  
the film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout , both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters  
the fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film  
there are several moments of bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension  
in a low-budget independent film from a first-time director , these faults can sometimes be forgiven , if the screenplay is fresh and solid  
that is not the case here  
the script suffers from random plot developments  
there are four or five of these turns in the plot , each one raising the question "" where did that come from ? "" 
at one point , a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother  
we are supposed to be moved , but since the scene is completely un-led-up to , we really don't care if she and her mother get along  
we've never seen her mother before  
we never see her again  
who cares ? 
what's worse , these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy  
at another point , a character announces that she can't have children  
apparently , this is devastating  
we wouldn't know this because she never talked about having kids before , but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her  
the scene feels like an afterthought , its emotion manipulative and shallow  
these scenes grow worse and worse , culminating in an absurd climax  
two scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that i found myself laughing  
one scene is a lover's spat between two minor characters  
the other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax  
thinking on these scenes , it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities  
but it does  
first , it is original  
we men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups , and i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea  
it's something i don't think has been the subject of a film  
second , the interviews of the miami women are sincere  
taken together , they form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners  
the mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes , but each tile is some woman's real experience  
neither the picture of women , nor their picture of men , is truly representative , but the point is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way  
at some level , the stereotypes that emerge can be called true  
i can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their "" likes , dislikes , skills , and thrills , "" but on the whole , it's pretty bad "

-1,"let's get this one over with as quickly as possible  
if there was a possibility to receive a refund , this review would not be forthcoming  
but as it is , "" godzilla "" is without a doubt the loudest , longest , and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio  
producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves , and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch "" last year at merienbad "" until they can grasp the idea of content and plot  
no amount of hype , no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine ( billy the kid vs  
dracula )  
 "" godzilla "" opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs  
we are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship ( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins )  
well , the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature  
later , a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache ( jean reno ) interview the sole survivor  
in a state of shock , the only thing the man can utter is the word "" gojira "" ( the japanese name of the famed beast )  
we are then introduced to dr  nick tatopoulos ( matthew broderick , with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film )  
he is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population  
he is immediately drafted by the u  s  military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature  
in a short amount of time , another fishing boat ( loaded with canned tuna from the u  s  and korea for some reason ) is found grounded in jamaica  
well , it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york  
when the beast finally appears , he tears up one building , stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert ( thumbs up for new york )  
the military , with dr  tatopoulos's help , have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system  
it finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr  tatopoulos who snaps the beast's picture  
the monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting , and the chase is on , with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage  
working from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple , dr  totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated )  
well the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant  
needless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster's nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city ( even though the monster isn't dead yet )  
i sincerely hope that i've completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film  
i gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour's wage on this tripe  
everything about "" godzilla "" reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast  
the script ( and let's be clear here ) by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years "" razzie "" award  
the dialogue between maria pitillo ( as audrey timmonds , dr  tatopoulos' estranged girlfriend ) and mr  broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed )  
the film could be enjoyably campy if it didn't take itself so damn seriously "

mercury rising adds to a growing list ( including such stinkers as the jackal , last man standing , striking distance and the last boy scout ) of stale actioners he has headlined  
and though mercury rising tries to spice things up by throwing an autistic kid in the mix , it is every bit as stale  
art jeffries ( bruce willis ) is your typical tormented fbi agent  
you know the type , haunted by his job , yet so good at what he does that even physically assaulting another agent merely gets him a slap on the wrist  
enter simon ( miko hughes ) , an autistic boy , who , like rain man and all other autistic people , is a savant  
he can merely gaze at a super-encrypted message , and , while little computer beeps go off in his head , he can understand what it says  
naturally , this talent has brought him to the attention of the federal government  
lt  col  nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) , an nsa official bubbling over with evil , has spent countless time and money implementing the newest "" unbreakable "" code , mercury  
however , when two of his underlings ( robert stanton and bodhi pine elfman ) publish a mercury-encrypted message in a puzzle magazine as a final test of its effectiveness , simon cracks the code  
naturally , this infuriates kudrow , who sends a terminator-like hitman ( l  l  
ginter ) to eliminate the security hazard  
and that's where art jeffries comes in  
for some reason that's never explained in the film , the fbi is called in to help , and through a series of intricate machinations , art becomes the sole protector of the young autistic boy  
in a few unrealistic sequences , he enlists the aid of a stranger , stacey ( kim dickens ) , to help out , but she is given very little to do overall  
the central concept behind mercury rising is ludicrous  
why bother trying to kill the kid    i 
mean , who would know ? 
it's not like the kid ( or anyone else for that matter ) knew he was cracking a government super-cypher  
and even if he is eliminated , what does that help ? 
he's already proven that mercury can be broken  
there's always the chance that someone else would crack it    but 
i guess without a kid in jeopardy , there's not much of a movie here  
for all its faults , the film actually starts relatively well ( once you pass the painfully familiar teaser )  
the film flirts with developing real characters , and a semblance of a plot    then 
mr  terminator the hitman appears and everything begins going downhill    quickly  
miko hughes does a decent job , for his age , at creating a touching performance  
however , don't go to this film looking for any new insights into autism ( not that many people will ) "

-1,"`bats' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan  
to pull something like this off , you need to have a sense of wit and style , with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines  
something like the underground worm thriller `tremors' had just the perfect mixture of these elements , and in return , the film was tremendous fun  
with the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player , `bats' mainly plays it's premise for straight-arrow horror  
judging by the ridiculous premise , this was not exactly a wise move  
the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock's `the birds' , but fails miserably  
done right , it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema  
unfortunately , `bats' is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly , terribly wrong  
the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be  
i will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom `bats' is aimed toward  
those guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats  
these bats are not very nice , because they eat a lot of people  
boy , are these bats ugly  
they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super-duper smart  
they've got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all  
a whole bunch of people in texas get killed , so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats  
they have big guns and other cool things to fight them with , but the bats are pretty smart , so it's sorta hard to do  
the bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good  
but no , `bats' is probably too violent for pre-schoolers  
the film , directed by louis morneau , should have ventured straight into video stores  
on the small screen , perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations  
but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward ; although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure , the film is poorly written , poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude  
even the bats themselves are cheesy , and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed  
the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey ( lou diamond phillips ) , who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small-town authority figure usually portrays ( he chomps on a cigar , struts contentedly in his boots , etc    )  
the scientist is dr  sheila casper ( dina meyer ) , who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as `the best in her field'  
meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable , but everything about dr  casper is recycled beyond recognition  
her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hooper's tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in `jaws'  
everything revolving around `bats' is tired drivel , which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up  
the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw , with voices dubbed in later  
in fact , that may have worked out better in the end  
take one glance at casper's bat-loathing sidekick jimmy ( leon ) , and you'll have immediate deja vu - he's the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie , constructed specifically for timed comic relief  
unfortunately , none of his comic interludes are funny  
in the role of deranged mad scientist dr  mccabe , the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch "

hc : as we go to the top of the 8th , we're joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli , who's here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie , major league : back to the minors , the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors  
nice to see you , jim  
as a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer , can you give us the scoop on the new flick ? 
jb : my opinion : the producers should have stopped while they were ahead , and that was nine years ago  
one entry was definitely enough , and i'm surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2  this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct-to-video  
it's worse than a mediocre made-for-tv feature  
i should also mention that this movie likely won't play all that well in cleveland  
now that the real indians are perennial contenders , they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks  
actually , most of the action involves the twins' aaa minor league club , the buzz , rather than the actual major league franchise  
hc : sorry to interrupt , jim , but we still have to do play-by-play for the game on the field  
leading off this inning is john warren  
he steps into the batter's box and takes kent's pitch low for ball one  
wh : so , the story's strictly minor league , right ? 
what's it about ? 
jb : scott bakula , the guy from quantum leap , plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell  
when twins owner roger dorn , once again portrayed by corbin bernsen , needs a new manager for his aaa team , he offers the job to gus , who is now faced with two daunting tasks : turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson ( played by walt goggins ) for a promotion to "" the show  "" 
with the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano ( dennis haysbert ) , rube baker ( eric bruskotter ) , and isuro tanaka ( takaaki ishibashi ) , gus gets the buzz on the right track  
in fact , he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the big-league club , leonard huff ( played with over-the-top relish by ted mcginley )  
soon , dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus' overachieving group against huff's overpaid , last-place bunch  
wh : can we guess who wins ? 
jb : the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when you've already seen the box score  
on top of that , none of the mock-ups are presented with much flair  
they're not just boring ; they're lackluster  
but the major league movies have never been about drama or tension ; they've been about using baseball situations to generate laughs  
hc : warren fouls off a fastball  
1 and 1  
wh : are there lots of yuks in this one ? 
jb : not one , from start to finish  
i enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny  
okay , a lot of the jokes were sophomoric , but they made me laugh  
the two sequels haven't just been stale , but their humor quotient has been abysmally low  
even bob uecker's once-sharp one-liners have turned lame , and they're the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing  
hc : here's the 1-1 pitch  
looooooong drive ? fair or foul ? foul ball ! 
the count goes to 1 and 2  
wh : does the film at least get the baseball details correct ? 
jb : yes  
there aren't any glaring errors like there were in one of the best-ever baseball movies , the natural  
but i'd gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story , believable characters , or even a little genuine humor  
heck , the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league : back to the minors  
wh : it's nice to see old friends one more time , isn't it ? 
like cerrano , tanaka , and dorn  
jb : depends on whether you really care that anyone is back  
there aren't any real characters here ? just an assortment of cliched oddballs  
yeah , the voodoo hitter , the catcher who can't throw back to the pitcher , the japanese player , and the conceited player-turned-owner have all returned , but who really cares ? 
they have no depth "

-1," "" snake eyes "" is the most aggravating kind of movie : the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing  
it's not just because this is a brian depalma film , and since he's a great director and one who's films are always greeted with at least some fanfare  
and it's not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance , this film is hardly worth his talents  
it's worse than that  
it's aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more , could be totally intelligent , and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely    then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half-assedness  
or more deservedly , the hall of fame of the eighth-assedness  
in certain circles , "" snake eyes "" was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa's classic "" rashomon , "" where a crime is told from the four different ( and i mean different ) perspectives , and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening , which , i might add , is superb  
in one very very very long steadicam shot , we meet the protagonist , crooked atlantic city detective , rick santoro ( cage ) , and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife , interupts a pay-per-view event on tv , chases down a gambler , enters the arena all pumped up for the fight , sits down and talks with his bud , kevin dunne ( gary sinise , who's character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn , who's also in this ) , and watches as it happens  
there's a big name in the crowd , and that's the secretary of defense , charles kirkland ( joel fabiani ) , who's sitting behind rick , and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion , lincoln tyler ( stan shaw ) , is knocked out  
this all happens in the opening shot , and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction  
what really happened , this film asks , and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene    and 
discovers there's a very good possibility it was a conspiracy  
as we follow rick trying to learn of more information , we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot ( carla gugino ) , and who flees the scene in a panic , and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness' takes on what happened  
this is all going pretty fine and dandy , and it's extremely interesting to watch    then 
it takes one wrong step  
we follow the wrong character , and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on , and way before rick can find it out  
but that's not the worst part of it : it's that it's the one person you didn't think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring , the one you didn't think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it  
it only gets worse : the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film , and since we already know what happened , we can't rely on rick's investigation to be all that interesting  
it's as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in , and decided to just fall back on an easy way out , and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible  
events become more and more proposterous , and by the end , the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this : the deux ex machina  
that's where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay  
this time , it's a hurricane , an out-of-control police car , and a big round ball that adorned the arena  
what went wrong ? 
depalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this  
depalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , "" blow out , "" where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece  
but granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries  
at least his direction makes up partly for it  
then there's koepp , who showed such great ability at making a character's flaws come to life like he did in depalma's earlier "" carlito's way , "" a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well  
he can write a flawed character , but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort  
he's flawed , and we can see redemption if the story wasn't so formulaic  
a scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup  
he may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like  
this is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way "

-1,"the blues brothers was a wonderful film , a hilarious comedy packed with good music  
it cried out for a sequel , but john belushi's untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea  
however , eighteen years have passed , and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged  
unfortunately , it's a sequel not worthy of the original  
the film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended  
elwood blues ( dan aykroyd ) is just getting out of jail , his brother jake having recently died  
as in the first film , he first visits mother mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) and then sets about getting the band back together  
john belushi's absence leaves a terrible hole in the film , and although three new characters are created to fill the void , it is still very noticeable  
first , there's cabel ( joe morton ) the illegitimate son of elwood's stepfather ( played by cab calloway in the first movie )  
cabel is reluctant to join his destiny , and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff , chasing the blues brothers band  
next , there's mighty mack ( john goodman ) , a bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band  
finally , there's buster ( j  
evan bonifant ) , a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood and eventually joins the band  
the plotting of the film is hardly original    it 
seems to be almost a clone of the original  
elwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member of the band , they then travel , while being pursued by the police , and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale  
the first film had neo-nazis as the random element , this time around , the russian mafia and a militia group fill their role  
in fact , the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical to the original  
remember the classic performance at country bob's ( where they like both types of music : country and western ) from the first movie ? 
well , this movie has a performance at a country fair , where the band is expected to play bluegrass music  
there's the massive police car pileup , although this time the gag falls completely flat  
there's even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of reverend cleophus ( james brown )  
there are plenty of recurring characters too  
in addition to mother stigmata and reverend cleophus , aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs  murphy  
frank oz , a prison guard in the first film , makes an appearance here as the prison warden  
as the stars , the new blues brothers don't live up to their legacy  
aykroyd is more loquacious , yet much flatter as elwood  
john goodman barely has a character as mighty mack  
joe morton has the deepest character , but not a terribly interesting one , as cab  
and what's the deal with the orphan ? 
it plays like a desperate gimmick that doesn't mesh at all with the rest of the film  
at least bonifant isn't as precocious as he could have been in the role  
but the true star , and the only saving grace , of the film is the music  
and the film is packed with it ( even during and after the ending credits )  
although there are no brilliant mergers of comedy and song as in the original's rawhide/stand by your man medley , the music is very much enjoyable  
to top it off , the film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearances

-1,"the most interesting part of "" can't hardly wait "" just happens to be not only the most human , but for many of us , the one part that many of us can easily relate to  
that is the character of denise ( lauren ambrose ) , the film's sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film , and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored  
the film wisely holds over this moment , nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party    almost 
too nicely  
for some members of the audience ( read : me ) , this is basically a mirror of what's going on with them watching this film  
we sit there wondering why we've even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place  
i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this  
after all , this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with  
everyone's here : the jock , the homecoming queen , the nerd ( and his dominions of trekkies and x-philes ) , the alienated wannabe writer , the school spirit girl , the pothead ( s ) , the wigger , etc , etc , etc , and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial , lame , and basically as a bunch of losers  
except for denise , who rolls her eyes at everything , and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks ( her yearbook entry , something which is done for each main character , quotes oscar wilde - definite pointers there )  
unfortunately , the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film  
the film , as i said , portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything  
however , instead of sticking with this , perhaps even going a bit further with it , they let this lie , and actually make these characters into our heroes  
we follow several of them , all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism , and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared and/or identified with them  
and if we did , we certainly don't want to revisit that state of being  
here's a quick low-down : it's graduation , and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night , otherwise known as the "" american grafitti "" or , to a lesser extent , the "" dazed and confused "" cliche  
the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly ; the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party  
 "" can't hardly wait "" just opts for a big indoor keg party , and a little bit of aimless driving , albeit of the i'm-whining-because-i-can't-get-a-girl-i-want brand  
we follow many people around , but mostly we trail preston ( ethan embry , of "" that thing you do ! "" ) , the alienated writer , who's been pining over the homcoming queen , amanda ( the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt ) , for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart  
now that she's broken up with her football player boyfriend , mike ( peter facinelli ) , he decides to go to the party with a note he's written declaring his "" love "" for her in the hopes he'll build up the guts to give it to her    even 
though he's leaving for a multi-week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut ( okay : the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson ? )  
since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn't be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film , and because it's a party , there are some more main characters , such as : william ( charlie korsmo , finally surfacing after "" dick tracy "" ) , the nerd ( and his dominions ) who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike , who's humiliated him for years , but gets too caught up in drinking to do it ; kenny ( seth green ) , the wigger , who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid ( uh huh ) ; and denise , the only exceptional character , who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom ( don't ask ) with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile  
ugh  
the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not "" american grafitti "" or "" dazed and confused , "" two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers ( not to mention were extremely entertaining ) , but to john hughes films of the 80s , most notably "" sixteen candles  "" 
the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters , and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion  
this film forgets to satirize its characters , and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes    and 
then says that it's all okay  
we can't take this film seriously , nor can we take this as fun , so really what good is it ? 
but i will tell you some things i did like : i liked the direction , except for a couple too-over-the-top features , like way-too-glossy jump cuts ( it's like an oxymoron ) and other obscurities  
generally , though , elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement , and even manage to capture an altman-esque feel to their film from time to time ( a thing with a note , though , is too hokey to really be admirable )  
i actually did like seth green , for once in about a decade ( when he played a very young woody allen in "" radio days "" ) - his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable    almost "

a favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981 , paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands  
it wasn't just the film's disappointing box office performance  
indeed , in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two , three , even six times  
no , the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year  
in a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events , some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming : "" mommie dearest : the biggest mommie of them all ! ""  
executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn , but it was all too late  
mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history  
unfortunately , faye dunaway's energetic , at times ridiculously over-the-top performance is about the film's only redeeming feature  
based on daughter christina crawford's trashy biography , mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother  
if you believe this movie , it was a life was racked by obsession , lonliness , child abuse and rampant egomania  
the film begins with crawford adopting two children , and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown-up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother's will  
joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves , you see  
but that's about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film's end  
the script - laboured over by four writers , a bad sign in itself - is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum  
frank perry's direction is no more than competent , and dunaway's bitchy lines aside , the dialogue is flat and uninvolving  
in fairness , the film's second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters  
when the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling , joan visits and keeps in touch , not helping her financially but encouraging christina's own acting and career ambitions  
crawford does seem to care about her daughter , but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain  
you also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers  
ah , but there is dunaway's performance  
and what a delicious piece of campery it often is  
having just been sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds , crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden  
she has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess she's making  
spotting a young tree she doesn't like the look of , she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line "" tina ! ! 
fetch me the axe ! ! "" 
with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling  
in the film's most outrageous scene , joan realises that some of her daughter's clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers  
oh dear ! 
sounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum , doesn't it ? 
this time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst : "" no    wire    hangers     ever ! ! ! ! ""  
and later , when the board of her late husband's company pepsi cola tries to divest her of her directorship , she displays a superb grasp of business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring : "" don't fuck with me , fellas ! ! ""  
oh joy ! 
something of a camp classic , then , but if that's not you're cup of tea then mommie dearest doesn't have too much to recommend it  
better you see the real crawford in the women ( 1939 ) , mildred pierce ( 1945 ) or whatever happened to baby jane ( 1962 ) "

-1,"the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities  
the best tales of the genre deal with mankind's struggle for survival or knowledge  
such popular and noteworthy tomes as "" stranger in a strange land "" by robert heinlein , "" childhood's end "" by arthur c  clarke and "" man in the high castle "" and "" do androids dream of electric sheep "" by philip k  dick all deal with man's need for identity and struggle for self worth  
hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu ( if not the message ) of science fiction since it's beginnings  
most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved  
it really wasn't until producer george pal , took charge of robert heinlein's novel "" rocketship galileo "" and crafted the film "" destination moon "" , that 'sci-fi' ( as it is commonly referred to ) , came into it's own  
from there , such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick , have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre  
with the release of touchstone pictures "" mission to mars "" , we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci-fi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe  
the film opens on a summer barbecue , as phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission  
woody blake ( tim robbins ) and his wife terri ( connie nielsen ) commit to his coming authority on the mission , and luc goddard ( don cheadle ) consoles his son  
entering the party is jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife , maggie ( kim delaney )  
luc consoles jim with woody's assistance  
the three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them  
but jim still longs to set foot on the red planet  
the mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars  
they send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface  
going out to investigate , luc and his team approach the famed 'face on mars'  
a strange noise emanates from the rock  
as the team tries to scan through the rock with radar , a violent wind storm erupts , creating a vortex that kills all members of the team , save for luc  
back on the space station orbiting earth , woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing  
luc's interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team  
the second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger  
meteorite showers , explosions , and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet's surface  
the big question is , is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars  
and if so , what is its relationship with us ? 
now for the bad news  
the entire plot of "" mission to mars "" is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe  
the famed 'face on mars' becomes the centerpiece of the film , revealing some of the most harebrained sci-fi pabulum the screen has witnessed  
borrowing ideas from such films as "" robinson crusoe on mars "" ( 1964 ) , quatermass and the pit ( 1967 ) , "" 2001 : a space odyssey "" , and even mario bava's "" planet of the vampires "" ( 'terrore nello spazio' ) ( 1965 ) , "" mission to mars "" is a hodgepodge of ideas that don't add up to a satisfying whole  
while some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed , the film remains flat and un-involving  
so much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film , but to no good use  
the performances are all workmen like , with only don cheadle ( as luc ) carrying any sort of real chemistry  
gary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation  
and the mistaken idea of having jerry o'connell ( as phil ohlmyer ) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse  
and the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better  
he's just having too much fun here to give a damn  
the script has a few lapses , namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower , no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage  
this of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship "

-1,"it seemed like the perfect concept  
what better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? 
it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh  
jim carrey's signed on too ? 
even better  
the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as "" schizophrenia , "" and so forth  
such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire , proving that some people just couldn't take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy  
yes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny  
it's not for lack of trying  
the farrellys utilize in "" me , myself & irene "" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them  
this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult  
soon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster  
this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted , or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street  
then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks  
some have suggested that this isn't a problem , because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work  
they're wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort , 1996's "" there's something about mary  "" 
 ( 1999's "" outside providence "" was technically an earlier project  ) 
the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected  
in "" mary , "" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion  
 "" me , myself & irene , "" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at "" mary "" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work  
having been produced by the same guys who made "" mary , "" "" irene "" seems like an even bigger disappointment  
the brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes  
but they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh ; most of "" me , myself & irene "" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy  
the plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p  waters ( renee zellweger ) , who's in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that's entirely predictable from the get-go  
 ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? 
yeah , me too  ) 
the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be  
compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it's no longer funny , merely gross  
the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry  
take , for example , the subplot involving charlie's three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon )  
the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face  
but by the end of the film , they're still doing the same schitck ; it hasn't been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn't been dropped either  
that's too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through  
 "" me , myself & irene "" reeks of wasted opportunities  
there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie's new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank's actions  
this doesn't really happen ; nearly every supporting character learns about charlie's condition early on , so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it  
the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , "" whitey "" ) , but the script doesn't go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax  
jim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he's left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in "" all of me  "" 
it's a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny  
carrey doesn't pull any stunts we don't expect him to pull , and the farrellys' script doesn't give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren't set up in any meaningful way  
perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better "

ewan mcgregor - codename : "" eye "" - is pointing a high-tech rifle-ly gadget at a fat , bald business-oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across the street  
we get the requisite electro-green through-the-sight view  
we the audience , seeing a high tech rifle-ly gadget , of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target , but instead , he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy , low-quality photographs , which eye then proceeds to fax and e-mail to everyone in his target's office  
all right , so thirty seconds in , i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle/camera , but i was still open minded    
maybe there's a really good reason for it  
i've got reason to believe , you see - i admire a lot of ewan mcgregor's previous work    
and he's obi wan ke- friggin-nobi for god's sake  
and director stephan elliot's last movie priscilla , queen of the desert was a quirky little delight  
there's some genuine talent involved here  
i think at the twenty minute mark , there was still a spark of hope in my heart  
eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization's son ( i still have no idea what this organization was - british intelligence ? 
national spy ring ? 
private investigation ? ) , who is apparently stealing from his trust fund  
he has received his assignment from k  d  
lang , through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase  
when eye tracks his target to an expensive- looking secluded house , he witnesses a mysterious and beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) take a knife out and proceed to stab the poor bastard  
ok , that's odd , i think to myself , this could be interesting  
then she starts to cry , and through her tears exclaims "" merry christmas , dad ! "" 
for the first time  
so begins our tale of obsession    
or    something  
the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor's eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states , totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar  
throughout his entire professional life , he has been a voyeur ; so when he falls for someone , the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras  
fine , that's a lovely premise , i suppose  
but gosh darn it , if you're going to go there , you better have some sort of explanation  
and that's precisely where this film fails  
this is the kind of movie that pisses me off  
it's an abortion , a collection of half-formed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end  
it pretends it is something that it is not - a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a high-tech thriller  
here , the filmmakers have confused "" surreal "" and "" deep "" with "" vaguely unclear "" and "" crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors  "" 
i never , even for an instant , had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in "" love "" with this woman who changes wigs and kills people "

an awfully big adventure ======================== 
the reteaming of director mike newell and star hugh grant is about as far removed as you can get from the lightsome comedy of four weddings and a funeral  
their second collaboration is a downbeat theatrical drama about a young intern ( georgina cates ) struggling to survive in post-w  w  ii 
liverpool  
hugh plays the gay director , an * extremely * unappealing character who may alienate whatever fans are left after the nonsense of nine months  
bleak make-up and thick accents conspire to make this a difficult story to settle into  
an awful adventure is not without * some * rewards , tho

the comparisons to chinatown are easy enough , except for the fact that this film isn't nearly as gripping  
writer/director carl franklin ( one false move ) is the force behind this accomplished-but-stiff adaptation of walter mosley's crime novel

tom sizemore and scene-stealer don cheadle are both fine  
the problems start with jennifer beales , who never registers as the plot's femme fatale  
she's a pretty face and nothing more  
also underweight are maury chaykin and terry kinney  
they play opposing mayoral candidates in 1948 los angeles and neither actor commands enough authority to stifle giggles

fine period detail and a strong sense of humor are a plus  
they help to overcome a pace that's too polite for mosley's jazzy , swingin' story

-1,"if anything , "" stigmata "" should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly-themed films relatively close to one another  
of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year , it is clearly the worst  
i suppose i should have seen this coming  
after all , "" blair witch "" thoroughly creeped me out , "" sixth sense "" was mildly spooky , and then "" stir of echoes "" had its moments , but wasn't anything i'd lose sleep over  
clearly , the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping  
is it then any surprise that "" stigmata "" is the dullest , most horribly executed piece of mtv-influenced tripe i have seen in a long while ? 
no , not really  
patricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe-trotting mother  
as it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently-deceased brazilian priest  
the priest's church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue  
father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue  
his investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ  
father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie' s story , considering she's an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on  
he eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church  
as it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a "" fifth gospel "" before they were excommunicated  
the new rupert wainwright music video  
  
  
i mean film "" stigmata "" is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse  
indeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it's only interesting for about five minutes  
i'm not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion , double-exposure , and extreme close-ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school  
his camera trickery is interesting for a little while , but eventually , it becomes headache-inducing  
what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is ) , with wainwright screaming at the audience , "" see ? 
look at what i can do ! 
i'm an ex-cellent dir-ect-or  "" 
maybe then he'd explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! )  
if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn't see it  
just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double-exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever  
arrrrrrrghhhh  
  
  
then again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn't bother me if "" stigmata "" had a story or characters that were remotely engaging  
though wainwright's vanity certainly doesn't help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script  
where are plot continuity and character development when you need them ? 
case in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with , but we aren't given any back story on her character , or any reason to like her  
the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she's kind of cute , so let's start the bleeding ! 
the fact that she's clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn't help , either  
according to frankie page , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ? 
go clubbing ! 
sure , that makes sense  
arquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking  
scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable  
even though frankie page's life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon  
even more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances  
father andrew's religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic  
as for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , "" i'll get you , my pretty , "" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded "

it does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors , led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director ( todd holland ) , all wanted to make this film  
in fact , it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf's tribe as possible  
in retrospect , i can imagine how bad this film could have been  
i shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss  
dreyfuss plays james krippendorf , an anthropologist who is granted $100 , 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea  
halfway into his two-year expedition , his wife ( apparently ) dies  
i say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established  
later , we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big-screen tvs and other such pleasures  
so , when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely , he decides to construct an elaborate lie  
he makes his own tribe , using his three children as actors in a video  
he simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe ( which he calls the shelmickedmu )  
audiences at krippendorf's lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision  
and proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community  
like all films like this , the lie becomes more and more complex , and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero  
dreyfuss is a funny , talented man , and he is funny in this film  
he has lots of positive energy and , unlike most comical actors , really manages to play people like this realistically  
this film also requires a lot of physical humor that i've never seen dreyfuss perform , and he does a great job  
jenna elfman , who plays veronica mecilli , a scientist who wants in on krippendorf's work , is also very funny and appealing here  
and the kid actors are great , as well  
but we're talking about the script from hell  
this is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen  
but the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it  
all the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew  
no , the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and mean-spirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched  
furthermore , the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless  
take , for instance , the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex  
they get all decked out in the tribe getup , complete with paint to darken their skin  
krippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe  
now , i saw this scene coming from a mile away , but i said to myself , "" no , that would be far too tasteless  
there's no way they'll do that    oh 
god ! "" 
they did do it  
it's there  
i was almost more appalled by the fact that this didn't bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film  
i found it deplorable  
and when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it , he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice  
the film is filled with scenes like these "

magoo , they claimed , would be an insult to the men and women they represented  
in fact , they were wrong  
mr  
magoo is not just an insult to the blind and near-blind , it's an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny , 90 minute atrocity  
it's stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas  
look at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases , and you'll see a shocking list of retreads , including 101 dalmatians , george of the jungle , jungle2jungle , that darn cat ! , flubber , and now mr  
magoo  
the best of these ( george of the jungle ) was mildly entertaining  
the worst , mr  
magoo , exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be  
the first problem with mr  
magoo is the script  
despite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft , mr  
magoo is comically barren  
from beginning to end , there's not a laugh to be found  
every attempt at humor -- and there are lots of them -- falls flat with an audible thud  
you'd think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film , at least a few would work , but that's not the case  
i've had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures  
then there's leslie nielsen , who looks , sounds , and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character ( memorably voiced by jim backus )  
in the past , nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun  
lately , however , he has been getting lazy , taking parts in the likes of dracula : dead and loving it , spy hard , and mr  
magoo  
even if nielsen was in top form , it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo ( especially since we're reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film ) , but "" top form "" is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here  
this is strictly a take-the-money-and- run operation  
the story , which , like many disney stories , can be described in one long sentence : magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum , and , as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own , the police mistake him for the robber  
the cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky , who take their lumps early and often  
the bad guys are kelly lynch ( who does a lot of martial arts-type kicking ) , nick chinlund , and malcolm mcdowell ( who has the good sense to look embarrassed )  
matt keeslar portrays one of magoo's sidekicks -- his nephew , waldo  
the bumbling man's other , more interesting companion is a dog named angus  
most of mr  
magoo's humor comes in the form of failed slapstick  
the cartoon violence level in this film doesn't approach that of home alone 3 or flubber , but it's still pretty acute , with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices  
there's a non-violent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better , but , compared to mr  bean's recent , similar misadventure , it doesn't hold up well  
then there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoo's near blindness , such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby  
i'm willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack "

-1,"eddie murphy has a lot riding on harlem nights  
as the movie's writer , director , executive producer , and star , murphy will shoulder all of the blame if harlem nights fails  
but at the same time , he'll receive all of the credit if it succeeds  
should you sacrifice your hard-earned cash to support murphy's risky gamble ? 
well , that depends on whom you trust more : me or eddie murphy  
here's what murphy thinks : "" i think the audience is expecting a good time  
they gonna get sexy  
they gonna get funny  
they gonna get drama  
they gonna get all of that  
i think it's the best movie i've done "" ( paramount radio network )  
here's what i think : harlem nights is charmless , unoriginal , disappointing , and almost without question , the worst film of the actor's career ( i haven't seen best defense )  
and guess who's to blame ? ! 
the movie's problem is not murphy's direction : harlem nights is a fairly good looking film  
no , the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled  
murphy's awful script is the culprit  
let's count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting : 
 ( 1 ) murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture  
yes , he even outdoes his own work in raw  
practically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word  
and after 15 minutes , it gets irritating  
 ( 2 ) murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast  
richard pryor , redd foxx , michael lerner , and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with stereotypes  
each of them shines occasionally , but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle  
 ( 3 ) the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men  
murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life , which is really neither here nor there  
but when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3 , 000 movie screens across the country , it's another matter altogether  
you're forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff  
for instance , murphy punches della reese in the stomach  
and he shoots jasmine guy in the head  
this is a mean-spirited movie , folks ! 
lovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy in her role as a common whore , but only because she doesn't have any scenes with murphy  
thank god : he might have run her over with a bulldozer  
 ( 4 ) murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date  
the loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges only once or twice during the film  
murphy would rather give his character a spiffy wardrobe than a spiffy personality  
sometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he could wear fancy suits and look debonair  
 ( 5 ) the plot is a shameless rip-off of the sting  
if you're going to make another sting movie , you've got to do something original  
murphy's tale of warring nightclub owners in harlem ( circa 1938 ) fails to add anything new to the formula  
 ( 6 ) to get laughs , murphy makes fun of stuttering  
you know a comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped  
 ( 7 ) murphy's idea of drama is a scene in which his character apologizes for the first time in his life "
-1," "" battlefield earth "" is the best comedy of the year  
it has to be  
the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider  
bad movie syndrome struck me again , so after witnessing how much "" battlefield earth "" has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles , i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first-hand  
is it as bad as advertised ? 
oh yes , very much so  
the plot is incomprehensible  
the acting is atrocious  
the special effects are mediocre  
the action is dull  
the implausibilities are legion  
the dialogue is cringe-inducing  
the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny  
i don't even want to continue reviewing this movie ; i'd like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible , but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory , so here it is : 
the premise is basically a rip-off of "" planet of the apes , "" only minus the apes and philosophical discussion , and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo  
the year is 3000 , the psychlos have conquered earth , and the human population has been enslaved  
only a handful of humans escaped to radiation-rich areas to escape the aliens ; they live out their lives in fear  
one man , johnny goodboy ( i know , i know ) tyler ( barry pepper ) , ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos  
there he confronts the psychlo head of security : a big , ugly , klingon-looking creature called terl ( john travolta )  
pressed into slavery , johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back  
meanwhile , terl is faced with his own problems : he has recently learned that he's stuck living on earth ( which he hates ) for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man's daughter  
he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology ( this is where the plot gets ridiculous  
  
  ) 
so the "" man-animal "" can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos can't go  
terl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself  
of course , his plan doesn't work  
so many things wrong with this movie -- where to begin ? 
how about with travolta , whose hollywood clout brought about this , the cinematic version of scientology guru l  ron hubbard's sci-fi novel ? 
early previews for "" battlefield earth , "" with constant shots of a makeup-laden travolta cackling like lex luthor , had me ( and several audience members ) remarking , "" what the hell is travolta thinking ? "" 
the movie did nothing to stem such remarks  
all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here : terl cackles after nearly every line , and so does every other psychlo  
of course , this makes every scene hilariously overwrought , no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary  
the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america , but ceos generally don't laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees  
 ( "" you were going to be promoted -- but now you're not ! 
fwahahahahahahahaha ! ! ! ! ! "" ) 
it's no big surprise terl loses to the humans -- he's an idiot  
he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book  
he underestimates his enemies , assuming he'll win just because he's smarter  
 ( he uses the word "" leverage "" like some sort of scientologist mantra  ) 
not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero , he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos' language and technology  
 ( why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me  ) 
he then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him  
no wonder this guy never got his promotion  
the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention "
-1,
-1,"while watching loser , it occurred to me that amy heckerling's true genius as a film-maker is casting  
in fast times at ridgemont high , she gave us sean penn's jeff spicoli ; in look who's talking , she turned bruce willis into a wise-cracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival ; in clueless , she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is ( or was ) alicia silverstone  
she seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws  
unfortunately , she may also be starting to understand that she understands  
giving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies  
giving appealing actors a script in which their appeal _is_ the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser  
naturally , heckerling makes her protagonist an all-around swell guy  
paul tannek ( jason biggs ) is a small-town boy who gets a scholarship to nyu , then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the cold-hearted big city  
paul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman ; his roommates adam ( zak orth ) , chris ( tom sadoski ) and noah ( jimmi simpson ) are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul  
paul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar , in this case the lovely dora diamond ( mena suvari )  
dora has problems of her own , including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor , edward alcott ( greg kinnear ) , that's more than slightly one-sided  
they're two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people , so clearly they belong together , even if paul is a loser  
i must confess that , for a while , i was suckered in by heckerling's casting  
jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace ; suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence  
they're pleasant enough to watch , and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists aren't  
then it gradually becomes clear that there's virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort  
in theory , loser is a romantic comedy , but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film ( notable exception : a cameo by a scene-stealing comic actor as a video store clerk )  
instead of taking any time to make the characters' situations funny , heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters' situations pathetic  
she shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless , nor any of that film's interest in lively plotting ( not surprisingly , since clueless's plot came via jane austen's emma )  
she simply turns the film into a pity party  
since loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character , you might think that those characters would be interesting , or at least slightly complicated  
instead , you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there's no reason to watch them  
paul isn't just a nice guy , he's flawless ; consequently , he's a central character who does absolutely no growing  
his roommates aren't just inconsiderate , they're actively evil-blackmailing professor alcott , drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity a bad name  
and professor alcott isn't just manipulative , he turns dora into his house slave  
dora's unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser , and even that isn't explored in sufficient detail  
there's more ambiguity in the 30-second snippet from alan cumming's broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser it's one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations ; it's another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush  
and it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow    
i don't know    
comic  
still , i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora  
that hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkel's "" scarborough fair/canticle  "" 
instead of giving the sequence a knowing wink-a reference to the graduate , a hint that paul is becoming an overly-sensitive clich-heckerling plays it deadly straight  
even in the scenes that scream for a light comic touch and a bit of a poke at her protagonist's foibles , she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint  
clueless's cher had her self-absorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness "

-1,"capsule : not as bad a sequel as crow 2 or batman & robin , but still horribly putrid , cheesy and ill-conceived  
this one belongs in saturday morning cartoons    
extended review : you know , about halfway through this movie , i realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes , you'd have a damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy , hong kong style martial arts  
beautifully choreographed by robin shou , who also plays liu kang , the fight scenes are both mind-blowing and graceful , acrobatic enough to make olympic gymnasts weep  
this is what made the original so fun , but unfortunately for the sequel , we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson  
instead , they got john r  leonetti , the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat  
not a good choice  
while the fight scenes are brutal and eye-popping , the rest of the movie looks like standard made for tv fare  
the acting is sub-par , which i could endure if it were not for a  ) the director's style , b  ) the special effects , & c  ) the treatment of the story and characters  
a  ) mr  leonetti should go back to lighting , in my opinion  
i could say dozens of bad things about him : he way overuses slow-motion , he has no eye for action , he can't get even mediocre performances out of actors , and so on  
but by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping  
apparantly , everybody can now fly  
hell , i'm all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick and whatnot , but not when it happens every few minutes , and is done so poorly  
better jumping and acrobatics has been seen in xena : warrior princess  
in short , they should have gotten paul anderson back  
or at least let robin shou direct    
b  ) unlike the first one , whose sfx were vibrant and somewhat realistic , mk : a's special effects are bland , fake looking , and overall just plain bad  
i counted at least half a dozen times that blue-screening was painfully obvious  
had this movie been made in the 80's , it would have been ground-breaking  
but in today's industry , it doesn't even look finished  
c  ) now for the _really_ bad parts  
i admit , i'm an avid fan of the mortal kombat series  
the games are amusing diversions , an easy way to work off stress and anger  
the first movie was a mindlessly fun thrillride  
this could have been a really cool movie  
it isn't "

-1,"m : i-2 , the sequel to mission impossible , is a james bond wannabe film , but it fails to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertainment value  
it tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it's an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses  
it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human  
the coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols  
the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence  
except for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed  
as for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen  
m : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue  
the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point  
the only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film's supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way  
it's a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series  
but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance  
john woo ( "" broken arrow "" / "" face/off "" ) is good at doing car chases , choreographed fights with midair flips and kung-fu kicks , slo-mo shots of two guns blazing , and of fire explosions , but he just can't seem to handle dialogue and suspense  
the star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast  
cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one  
their romance didn't work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn't convincing  
the film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success  
we will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney , the american southwest , and seville  
first , we are in sydney , australia , where a scientist with a muffled russian accent , dr  nekhorvich ( rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it  
he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain  
which explains the film's mythic theme    as 
we enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil  
the one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role  
at least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense  
soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains  
before they crash the plane and parachute out of it , the one who was posing as dimitri , turns out to be sean ambrose ( scott ) , a rogue member of the imf , which is a cia-like clone  
he steals the package with the antidote , peels off a latex mask , which is a replica of the hero of the story , ethan hunt ( cruise ) , who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust  
sean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices  
we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel  
woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain  
it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense  
next we are in a mountain range in the american southwest , and ethan is on vacation , hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool , when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard , delivers via a rocket launcher , a pair of talking sunglasses  
hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help , billy baird ( john polson ) and luther stickell ( ving rhames ) , with luther running a high-gadget computer , but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall ( thandie ) to join his team  
he is told , as an incentive to recruit her , all her criminal charges will be dropped  
hopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self-destruct in five seconds  
actually , with the departure of hopkins , it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at this point "
-1,
-1,"the above is dialogue from this film , taken almost completely in context , and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is  
it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film , and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about , especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously  
mr  gregg "" i'm-having-a-mid-life-crisis "" araki , the writer and director of this film , wants to show how important teenagers are , and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible , horrible world  
and how does he show it ? 
by really cheap surrealism , and moronic exchanges like this  
oh , and it gets better  
a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of , oh i dunno , the fiftieth sex scene in this film ( i'm not counting the several masturbation scenes )  
in it , one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another , and he says to her something along the lines of "" do you ever wonder what life is all about ? "" 
sorry , man : foreplay takes place before the act of coitus  
of course , what do you expect : the film was written and directed by a guy who can't even spell his first name right ( yes , i know it's a cheap joke , but it had to be done )  
 "" the doom generation "" is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them , and also as another "" teen angst "" film ( one of the slogans is "" teen is a four-letter word "" - hardy har har )  
it's a film about two angsty teens - amy blue ( rose macgowan , who would later play the buxom tatum in "" scream "" ) and jordon white ( james duval , who would go on to play randy quaid's son in "" independence day "" ) - who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac , xavier red ( jonathan schaech , who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in "" that thing you do ! "" 
- and by the way , do you get the symbolism ? 
red , white , and blue ? 
huh ? 
huh ? ) , and go on a road trip where three things happen , in no order : 1 ) they have sex ; 2 ) they run into weird people ; 3 ) they kill them  
the film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films  
gregg araki obviously has seen such films as "" easy rider , "" "" natural born killers , "" and "" kalifornia , "" and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide  
but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not , or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper  
 "" the doom generation "" doesn't want to do this ; it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level  
he wants to show everything in a weird manner , and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about  
here's one scene , an earlier scene in the film : amy and jordan go into a quick-e mart type place to get food and other stuff  
amy is smoking , and the clerk , an asian man mind you ( i love how racist this film is , i really do ) , tells her to put it out  
she tells him to fuck off or something to that note  
he points a shotgun at her , and she puts it out reluctantly  
jordan makes two hot dogs , and takes them to the counter  
the cash register rings up "" 6  66 "" 
 ( oh , and this symbolism doesn't stop here )  
jordan checks for his wallet but it's really in the car  
he asks amy for it , but she left her wallet in the car as well  
the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money  
they say they don't have it  
he gets ready to kill them , but then xavier , who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before , pops out of nowhere , fights with the clerk , and ends with him blowing the clerk's head clean off ( clean wound , mind you )  
the head is shown flying through the air , and lands in a fryer , where it begins to scream  
i don't really object to this kind of sick violence , but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only : to gross you out  
araki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme , he'll make some kind of art  
wrong  
it takes a kind of resistance to make gore art  
when george romero made "" dawn of the dead , "" a very gory flick even for today , he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick  
same goes for peter jackson's disgustingly gory "" dead alive , "" which features a 30 minute long fest of blood , guts , dismemberments , flesh chewing , and other assorted stuff , all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body , taking out all sorts of zombies  
it was sick , but it was also satirical , and controled  
a scene like this has no purpose in the film , and it sticks out from everything else that happens  
here's a couple other scenes : jordan and amy have sex in a bath tub and xavier watches , masturbates , and then licks the semen from his hand ; xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window , masturbates , and falls backwards ; a man attacks the trio , and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword ( put there just so this could happen ) ; a fast food employee stalks the trio , and his arm is shot off by xavier ; and various other annoyances  
also , look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people , who probably didn't really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it ( just like peter o'toole , helen mirren , malcolm macdowell , and john gielgud probably didn't when they signed to be in "" caligula "" ) "

-1,"'bicentennial man' is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment  
chris columbus , the director who gave you "" mrs  doubtfire "" , plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point  
based on the short story by isaac asimov , it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human , which as you can imagine is very difficult  
starting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children  
soon this robot , called andrew ( robin williams ) shows abilities that makes his owner mr  martin ( sam neill ) very curious  
andrew is interested in art and music , he "" enjoys "" making clocks , which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions  
it shows out that because of a small failure in the "" electrical circuits "" and "" positronic brain "" andrew has accidentally gained a soul  
this makes him unique and his evil creators worried  
then mr  martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn't programmed to do  
soon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom , destiny and love  
this film can be described as a disney version of blade runner , a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction  
ever since that film , the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy  
what makes us human ? 
the thoughts ? 
the emotions ? 
is it possible to become human ? 
at what point can we say to a robot "" now you are one of us "" ? 
these are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach  
it is obvious that columbus didn't take them very seriously  
when you think about it , this film is not really meditating on the question "" when is a robot no longer a machine , but a human being ? "" , but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding  
andrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being , and only the society has troubles with it  
in other words , it is as far from reality as from the academy awards  
further more , there are other annoying problems  
to this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 50 years from now  
this has not been done for obvious reasons , because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task  
columbus is the first to have crossed that line  
the result is , as you might imagine , primitive , unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort  
the world is simply frozen in time  
neither the society , fashion , culture or values have changed over 200 years  
mom is still working at the kitchen , doing the dishes  
when you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today , you'll see a slightly bigger difference  
i am not saying that everything should change  
it is unlikely that the human rights will change , but it's even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science , technology and fashion

-1,"set in harlem during the great depression , rival gangster "" families "" go to war over control of "" the numbers "" , an illegal gambling lottery  
 "" runners "" take bets from potential lottery winners and deliver them to private locations for drawings  
the undisputed leader of the harlem numbers is the madame queen ( cicely tyson ) who is challenged by dutch schulz ( tim roth ) , a ruthless hoodlum  
by turning against the queen , dutch defies his partner , the infamous lucky luciano ( andy garcia ) , who wishes to respect the queen and keep the peace  
the queens' army strengthens when an acquaintance , ellsworth "" bumpy "" johnson ( lawrence fishburne ) is released from prison and becomes a bodyguard for her  
he proves himself worthy in short time as he thwarts an assassination attempt ( on himself and the queen ) , and later takes control of the queens army when she is jailed for tax evasion  
bumpy's reign is not as restrained and subdued as the queen and he declares all out war on dutch  
bloody gang warfare ensues  
bumpy faces many obstacles during his reign  
his new army questions his methods  
his girlfriend ( vanessa l  williams ) and the queen disagree with his violent solutions  
most importantly ( in his eyes ) , dutch has become a more formidable foe than he imagined , and seeks help from lucky luciano to assassinate him  
there have been so many movies dealing with organized crime that it must be hard to write an original story dealing with it  
this movie is not original at all  
in fact , i was angered by how many similarities there was between this film and , arguably , the best gangster movie of all time , the godfather  
if you are going to borrow ideas from another movie and not give credit , why not borrow from a lesser known movie ( say , millers crossing ? )  
how could the credited screenwriter chris brancato not give credit to mario puzo himself ? 
here are just some of the major similarities ( i stopped counting at 10 )  
crooked cop assaults blood relative of the leader  
gang extracts revenge on crooked cop  
wife ( or girlfriend ) questions her partners' murderous activities and leaves him  
high ranking "" officer "" betrays the leader  
blood relative of the leader murdered  
war erupting between the "" families ""  
high-ranking officer disapproves of the leader in front of other family members  
new leader runs family differently from previous leader  
large meeting with all families involved  
the setup in this movie is done rather well  
i enjoyed the portrayal of the network of "" runners "" sprinting through the streets collecting bets for the queens lottery  
this was the way of life in harlem , and most people involved with the queen did so because it was the only way to support their families and put food on the table  
number running was the only way for the harlem population to find work  
i also enjoyed the interaction between the angry , violent dutch and the calm , patient lucky  
after about the 30-40 minute mark all of the similarities with the godfather start appearing , one after the other ( and in short order )  
it was a huge distraction , and an insult to my intelligence  
who was the screenwriter kidding here ? 
some of the individual performances were well done  
andy garcia was very convincing as lucky , unfortunately his screen time is reduced to a supporting role  
tim roth effectively plays the cocky villain , much like his roles in "" the cook , the thief , his wife and her lover "" and "" rob roy ""  
the good performances and convincing setup during the first third of the movie do not make up for the lackluster story that follows  
a couple of coincidences is one thing , over a dozen is an insult "
-1,"suicide is pointless , everyone should know that  
so what's this movie like ? 
you guessed it    
pointless  
the virgin suicides focuses on the lives of the five lisbon sisters , from the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them  
when the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide , it sets in motion a series of events that will change the lives of many people forever  
that's what the press materials for the film probably say  
now here's what i say : the virgin suicides is a huge waste of time  
boring , arty , pretentious junk that is about as entertaining as    
well as committing suicide  
the movie lost me early on , immediately following the scene where the younger daughter jumps to her death from her bedroom window  
the girl's father ( james woods ) holds her lifeless body in his arms as their horrified family looks on  
then , as the scene ends , the lawn sprinklers come on  
is that a joke ? 
is that supposed to be amusing in some way ? 
from then on , the movie failed to draw me back in  
performances are the only saving grace of the virgin suicides  
woods plays the only character who would actually interest me when he came onscreen , but the performance of kirsten dunst as the next youngest daughter lux is worth mentioning as well  
dunst has the potential to be a big star , if she chooses her projects well  
and while this film is awful , she manages to come away from it virtually unscathed  
there are also a few cameos in the film here and there , which only frustrate the audience as they leave you wanting more  
as a result , they all seem rather pointless ( although there's a brief role given to michael pare from eddie and the cruisers which turns out to be his best role since    
well since eddie and the cruisers )  
perhaps the virgin suicides would have worked had the story not been told from the point of view of people who had very little access to the main characters  
we never get any significant insight into the girls and why they might be feeling what they're feeling  
all we really know is that mrs  lisbon ( kathleen turner ) is strict and keeps them on a short leash  
what mother doesn't ? 
it's certainly no reason to commit suicide  
with the godfather part iii , sofia coppola proved that she had no business being in front of the camera  
with the virgin suicides , she proves she has no business behind it either  
having family connections doesn't entitle you to be allowed to make movies  
so attention film directors    
stop letting your daughters pout their way into the industry  
just because they share your dna doesn't mean they share your talent "

-1,"i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple of interviews , and in both instances , he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon  
now , i personally remember those films as a ) starring a major motion picture star b ) being funny c ) having great action sequences d ) great chemistry e ) decent character development  
hmmm     okay    now on to my review of chill factor  
plot : a graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an ex-army general , to propose a nuclear device to international prospects  
when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps , they must keep it cool on ice , and rush it over to an army base , before the contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit , and kills millions of people  
critique : "" speed on an ice-cream truck "" is probably the pitch that was used to sell this one-tone movie to its backers , but unfortunately , the only way that anyone could compare this film to that tension-filled , original two hours of cinema , is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film , and the lethal weapon movies , stood for  
this film is seasoned in cliches , with plenty of badly written dialogue , over the top acting from cuba gooding jr  , zero chemistry between the two leads , and horribly tacky bad guys , tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe  
my friend and i enjoyed watching this movie to a certain extent , because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously "" written "" , that we just had to crack up  
that , and the formula for the film's script which followed the proverbial 1-2- , and you guessed it    3 scenario ! 
and what about all those catchy , hip names to get us to relate to the characters     "" elvis "" 
and "" nighshift "" , oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters ( and yes , it actually took two guys to come up with this regurgitated drivel )  
it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich and cuba gooding jr  got involved in this one-week-old-blue-cheese-smelling project  
did they actually think that it would boost their careers , or did they know that the script sucked , but discounted any fall from grace , knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall ? 
most probably the latter  
have you seen either fled or bulletproof ? 
well , despite the slight differences in plot , the essentials are basically the same here  
you get a black guy and a white guy being chased by a bunch of people , having no choice but to work together to get somewhere , hating each other at first , but over time , learning to respect one another as individuals  
yawn  
add to that , the fact that our film actually has bad guys who are all dressed in black , drive black cars and black vans , and run around with all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head  
not too conspicuous , eh ? 
call me a party-pooper , but as much as i like a nice cheezy movie as much as the next guy , this film just doesn't even try to do anything original or reasonably entertaining  
one cool scene with a boat careening down a mountainside , and another with a nuclear device obliterating everything on an island , do not a fun , buddy-action flick make  
show cuba the money , everybody ! 
 : ) 
little known facts about this film and its stars : this is not a little known fact or anything , but damn , is it just me or does skeet ulrich look an awful lot like great-looking actor johnny depp ? 
skeet's real-life nicknames include chester , skeeter and mosquito

-1,"plot summary : the year is 2024  
the ozone layer has long since gone and the earth is now protected from radiation by a shield invented by connor mccleod  
the shield , although saving lives , has made the atmosphere hot and humid  
connor is a mortal and a tired old man who has given up hope  
on returning from the opera one night connor is accosted by the leader of a "" terrorist "" organisation  
they have tried to find out what the company that now runs the shield unit are covering up  
connor is then attacked by two assassins sent by katana from the planet zeist ( like zeit--get it ? )  
they fail and connor becomes immortal again by chopping their heads off  
he then brings ramirez back to life in glencoe in scotland  
both ramirez and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment  
connor now has the option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found immortality and fight to find out about the company and the shield  
katana meanwhile , fearing connor would return , sets out himself to kill the highlander  
if you have never seen it  
being a fan of highlander and mr  connery , i was in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii : the quickening  
i wish it had been quicker  
i feel whatever else you can say about a film ( bad script bad music , etc  ) if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs to be said  
the film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so ( the time mr  connery is on the screen for ) is worth watching  
the plot sounds a little ridiculous but i was willing to give it a chance  
maybe they could pull it off  
instead , i find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first film  
it's as if they are different people with the same names  
witness connor jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance -- where is the attitude of "" who wants to live forever , when love must die "" gone to ? 
the love sub-plot * must * have had footage cut out  
the highlander and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before  
putting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying  
i still want to know why connor's coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal ! 
we are not given enough time on zeist to believe in it , nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill  
why not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck ? 
i know the head needs to come off but you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles first  
to be fair one assassin tried this but he must be the world's worst shot  
meanwhile connor develops luke-skywalker-like powers of laser beam deflection  
as for "" bad guys , "" we see a rebellion on zeist , crushed easier than a grape and then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist  
two assassins are sent , presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged connor kills them both with no problems  
no more assassins are sent  
katana , supposedly a very powerful man goes himself to kill connor  
has he no more assassins ? 
has he no better ? 
why was the rebellion crushed so easily then ? 
michael ironside is totally unconvincing ( bring back the kurgan )  
he seems like a cartoon character and really isn't that evil , just stupid and violent  
we see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening a child again and killing lots of innocents  
yet he still seems like no threat -- perhaps because he seems too stupid to threaten connor , or maybe because his two best assassins wouldn't have been amiss with larry , curly and mo "

it is one of the most ludicrously conceived efforts in recent history  
it has a clumsily told story , insipid dialogue , shallow characterizations , ugly scene transitions , no evidence of dramatic arc , headache-inducing sound effects , and a resolution that is completely implausible  
worse , there's the promise of a sequel  
why ? ! 
save your money  
some films go quickly to video  
this one , however , should go straight to the sci-fi channel's `mystery science theatre  ' 
in the year 3000 , man has become an endangered species  
most of humanity ( called ? man-animals' ) was destroyed generations ago in a battle against a race of plundering aliens ( called psychlos )  
survivors have either taken up shelter in caves or were enslaved to mine earth's resources for the rest of their lives  
the aliens are a menacing looking humanoid species that stand nine-feet tall , who resemble inbred klingons  
dimwitted as they are tall , their culture is predicated on power , extortion , and getting ? leverage  ' 
travolta , the leverage-using star , plays terl , the conniving security chief that oversees the mining facility on earth  
much of the movie is spent showing us examples of terl's petty machinations  
he routinely employs deception and then punctuates his statements with maniacal laughter  
but one thing is certain ; he hates being stationed on earth  
when the home planet informs him that he will be spending the rest of his life on this planet , he begins to devise his latest plan  
he will select a group of slaves to secretly mine out a gold ore site  
it's not clear how this benefits terl , except that it makes him richer in a place where he has no use for it  
the scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry peppers ) is selected as the slave group's leader  
a psychlo knowledge machine gives him the mining know-how  
but the machine also teaches him other things such as the psychlo language , the principles of our founding fathers , euclidean geometry , and the location of fort knox  
this enlightenment just doesn't prepare him for the mining assignment  
it also prepares him to organize and stage a massive revolt against their captors  
`we're going to blow up their home world , ' he says  
`but first , we need a few more supplies  ' 
in days , he and his comrades evolve from cave dwelling , loincloth wearing , rat eating slaves to fighter pilots and nuclear weapons experts  
by now , the audience is laughing as maniacally as terl  
the media have been working overtime to let the public know that john travolta's labor of love is a piece of sci-fi drivel  
numerous journals have called it an ill-conceived idea stemming from blind hubris , arrogance , and poor planning  
and after watching this movie , you'll wholeheartedly agree  
this is a terrible film that is illogically constructed , tediously acted , and frequently begs the question : why was this ever made ? 
at a price tag of $90 million , this film will be remembered as a gigantic folly , assuredly becoming `the avengers' of this summer  
both films were unforgivable and this promises to suffer the same speedy fate and subsequent indignity  
in addition to the universally pejorative reviews , there's another bizarre element to the `battlefield' saga  
this film would never have been made if not for the star power of travolta , who for over a decade , had been trying to persuade studios to bring the story to the big screen  
the controversy is that travolta is a scientologist , and `battlefield' is based on a 1982 novel by l  ron hubbard , the religion's late founder  
this led some to believe that `battlefield earth' would amount to scientologist dogma , laden with subliminal messages  
but the story is so poorly told that any message , subliminal or otherwise , is totally undetectable "

the garbage known as "" snuff "" films ? 
nothing , right ? 
what's to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography ? 
well    nothing  
so , why make it , hollywood ? 
there's no reason why the average , sane movie-goer will be interested in such a topic  
no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this  
the lack of quality filmmaking in "" 8mm "" ( from technical to acting ) stands out even more when you consider the star , writer , and supporting cast--all reputable  
but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again ! 
like paul schrader , schumacher has his moments , but they're few and far ( far ! ) 
between  
basically , this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it  
why not walk out ? 
well , this wouldn't be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie  
here's why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of "" 8mm ""    
first thing--if you don't heed my advice , then understand what you're about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud  
it's not easy to watch  
i didn't know the details of the story beforehand , but at least my ignorance can help others now  
the ( ha ! ) plot revolves around tom welles ( nicolas cage ) as a surveillance expert and private investigator  
a rich old woman discovers a "" snuff "" film in her late husband's safe  
she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl ( it had to be a young girl , didn't it , schumacher ! ) who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead  
she's horrified that her husband would have owned such a film ( in 8mm , of course ) and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find  
family-man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque "" murder ""  
let me backtrack for a moment  
see , "" snuff "" films are pornos with a violent twist--people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead  
however , the deaths are often staged and , in those cases , special effects and "" good "" acting make all the difference  
very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard-to-find movies  
the thought of this "" industry "" makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review , but i'll swallow my bile and move on  
welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry  
you'd think he's sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him ! 
he comes across smut clerk max ( joaquin phoenix ) who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze  
after a lot of digging and bribing , welles finds the men who are responsible for making this , and other , "" snuff "" films  
skip ahead , skip ahead , skip ahead    
led by dino velvet ( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance ) and star-torturer "" machine "" ( christopher bauer ) , they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue  
the movie doesn't end there , unfortunately , because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films do--become a vigilante  
this film doesn't draw you in  
it keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close ? 
it is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ( ie  
 "" se7en "" ) , but it takes a large measure of restraint ( schumacher has none ) and a larger amount of talent ( schumacher has little )  
by those jabs , i'm not only referring to his stylish destruction of the "" batman "" franchise , but "" a time to kill "" was an immensely overrated disappointment "

trap a varied group of people on an isolated location , then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one  
these have been the successful ingredients for many good films ( the thing , alien , aliens , and tremors to name a few )  
so , why is it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad ? 
 ( see the relic for a particularly putrid example  ) 
perhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient : effort and ideas  
deep rising meets these two requirements part way , but not enough to salvage the film  
treat williams is finnegan , the leader of a small boat crew who hire out their services ( and their boat ) for any activity    no 
questions asked  
this time , however , they may have gone too far  
their passengers , led by the ominous wes studi , are the type of multi-national terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films  
and their cargo    let's 
just say it has very high explosive potential  
what is the target of these thieves ? 
why , the argonauticus , of course , a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage  
but something else is hunting the argonauticus    something 
ancient and deadly  
by the time the thieves arrive , nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed  
and now the creature senses fresh meat ! 
so , you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew , joining forces with the surviving passengers ( including the ship owner canton ( anthony heald ) , and a thief with less lofty goals , trillian ( famke janssen ) ) against the terror from the deep  
and the monster gets to pick them off one by one  
fortunately for the creature , this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer  
why else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food  
if there's a more clarion call for unity , i don't know what it might be  
it's pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when  
there are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the end  
for the most part , the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audience's impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first  
 ( although i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou's life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad  ) 
treat williams is a passable hero , and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation  
but while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy , very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way  
the biggest treat in the film , however , has to be pantucci , kevin j  o'connor's whining engine-boy , under finnegan's employ  
his constant quips may be a bit over-written , but they manage to capture the same vein of nerve-addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens ( or todd graff as hippie in the abyss , for that matter )  
it's just a stock part ( the comic-relief character ) , but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable  
as far as the monster goes , although the cgi is done well , the creature has no logical consistency  
think back to the great ( or even just good ) movie monsters "

while watching instinct , i couldn't help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the well-explored themes of those earlier movies  
even beside the tarzan comparison , instinct just isn't a very good film  
it's painfully idealistic , manipulative , and silly  
i didn't hate it -- it's simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins ; furthermore , most of the acting is quite good  
but i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved  
i can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct , and it's pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams  
things start off in the predictable way , as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero , theo caulder ( cuba gooding , jr  ) , an ambitious , young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced , old psychiatrist ( donald sutherland )  
caulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life , the one he thinks will make him famous  
the subject is ethan powell ( hopkins ) , an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years  
powell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa , and it's now caulder's job to find out of he's mentally competent enough to stand trial  
through a series of short sessions , caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell  
even though it really is an old man version of tarzan , much of this central idea is rather interesting  
as i said , hopkins is captivating for every second he's on screen ; he has a way of convincing us that he's not acting , that he's actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas  
the character himself isn't very interesting -- he's just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas -- but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action  
gooding jr  does strong work opposite hopkins , playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual  
the screenplay , written by gerald di pego and "" suggested by "" a novel by daniel quinn , gives us no background information on caulder , but that seems to be the point ( he has no time for friends because he's obsessed with his work )  
nonetheless , these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct  
unfortunately , filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting  
turtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct's artistic failure , for they work together to make the dumbest , most cliche-ridden environment in which their characters are to live , and they do so by means of brainless subplots  
first , we have the prison warden subplot  
the prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder's progress at any cost ; if this means taking caulder off the powell case , then that's fine  
there's also the prison guard subplot  
the prison guard is played by john ashton ; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision , and he's instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion  
then there's the daughter subplot , in which maura tierney ( playing the daughter ) must look very upset a lot of the time ; after all , she is the daughter of a deranged man  
if some of this stuff sounds familiar , that's because they're all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films  
the evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here  
the offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoo's nest had  
ashton's evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy brown's in the shawshank redemption  
hopkins' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs  
and then there's the whole tarzan thing , which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film  
perhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the half-hearted attempt at philosophical depth  
the message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one : he thinks that humans are "" takers , "" that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas  
i can sympathize with that , but only when it's in a compelling film  
this is the kind of stupid movie -- just like patch adams -- in which a big group of characters ( psychotic inmates , in this case ) rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards  
what does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas ? 
if all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor , we would have had a thirty-minute movie far superior to the two-hour one that i watched today  
if the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise , then we would really have had something interesting -- a movie that doesn't rely on the strength of its actors "

but it isn't long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral , features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet , tries too hard to get us into the "" pain "" of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix  
in a sci-fi movie ? 
well , i don't know , much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half , only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement  
ultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise , joins the crew in their "" misadventures in space "" for the main crux of its journey , and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings this side of contact  
mind you , if you enjoyed that film's shrug-of-the-shoulders ending , you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well  
of course , i don't remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story  
ugh  
what a friggin' mess  
films like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again  
didn't anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ? 
didn't they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm , that ain't saying much ! )  
of course , you can't really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o'connell in this fine crew of thespians  
'nuff said  
neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film's musical score during the last fifteen minutes , presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay , we get it brian , this scene is supposed to be powerful    wow    yawn    my 
ears hurt ! )  
so is anything salvageable in this movie ? 
sure  
gary sinise does another great job , as does cheadle , the film doesn't completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening , and yes , the "" sand-twister "" effect that you see in the commercial is well done  
other than that ? 
i guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies    oops , 
did i say "" admire "" , i meant "" am disgusted "" ! 
all in all , this movie delivers very little in actual substance , offers two-bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo , pretends to be deep when really it's just sappy , and eventually just settles into an ending which , other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story , gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck

or even -- god help me -- palmetto  
alex proyas's new movie screams atmosphere  
i screamed , too , "" get me out of this theater ! "" 
new line cinema spent millions of dollars creating the expressionistic film noir visuals and paying the actors , and doesn't have any way to get it back  
i paid $4  25 for a matinee screening and don't have any way to get my money back , either  
you'll hear a lot from other critics about the look and feel of this movie  
i will admit that the cinematographers and costume designers and set artists and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create a stunning , nightmarish future world where it's always a late night in 1948 , complete with rotary phones and automats and fedoras  
i've got news for you fellows -- i don't care how hard you worked , or how visually stunning this movie looks -- you wasted your time and mine , working on a movie without a plot , without a clear sense of direction of where it wanted to go , without a soul or a reason to care  
the movie starts out oh-so-promising  
john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) is lying in a bathtub in the sort of seedy hotel that in real life , would have been boarded up long ago  
there is a dead , mutilated prostitute in the other room -- a surprise , as he has lost his memory  
the phone rings : it's a sinister-sounding man , claiming to be his doctor , telling him to flee for his life  
all well and good , right ? 
wrong  
apparently , someone decided that the audience was just a bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot  
 ( this is getting to be a popular assumption in hollywood  ) 
so , the actual beginning of the movie is not sewell running for his life , rather , it's a voice-over narration by the aforementioned doctor ( keifer sutherland ) explaining exactly what is going on and who is responsible  
it's as though sam the piano player had told us that rick and ilsa had been getting it on in paris in the first three minutes of casablanca  
no , wait , that's not fair to casablanca  
it's more like watching a new plotline at the first of the show -- or if you want to know how i really feel , having an off-screen narrator explain that gilligan won't be getting off the island in this episode  
>from here , the coherence of the plot goes down faster than ( insert monica lewinsky joke here )  
the characters just wander around the city aimlessly and bump into each other for no apparent reason , and that's what moves the plot  
what we're left with is a string of unanswered questions that don't make any sense  
we're given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers , yet they forget to use them at critical moments and get themselves killed  
we're given a hero who can "" tune "" into these same powers , yet he only uses them when it's convenient to the plot  
we're given a whole long list of loose ends that go nowhere 
usually , critics will say that an actor playing an underwritten part "" isn't given much to do  "" 
in this movie , no one is given anything to do  
sewell is given the impossible role of a man who doesn't remember anything , and plays it like    
um    
a man who doesn't remember anything  
the aliens are tall , pasty-faced , and bald , and wear long black cloaks and fedoras to remind us that they're evil -- and there's a child alien as well , straight out of an anne rice novel

-1,"capsule : gal is a 50s-ish london cockney gangster who has retired to spain  
his old associates want him for one last job and send the vicious don to give him an offer he can't refuse  
a standout performance by ben kingsley as don cannot save what is essentially a set of cliches recycled from old westerns  
 , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 
roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , "" who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by    
ben kingsley ? "" 
my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it  
they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles  
the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious  
that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast  
gary "" gal "" dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain  
life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing  
but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch  
the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa  
the second punch comes from gal's past  
back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal  
he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal  
don will accept any decision gal makes from "" yes "" to "" certainly  "" 
however , if gal says "" no "" don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy's ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman )  
in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody's skin  
kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness  
there are some serious problems in louis mellis's and david scinto's script that should have been caught before filming  
when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success  
beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him  
any local hood could have done what gal is needed for  
additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault  
no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool  
in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar  
i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade  
the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability  
the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im  
it is not a great plot  
in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards  
perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film  
it is an old plot dressed up to look new  
if the plot is old , at least the style is creative  
this is director jonathan glazer's first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout  
his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences  
cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes "
-1,
-1,"let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years  
i am not too fond of ted turner's world championship wrestling , however , and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight  
the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs ( david arquette , aptly cast as a neandrathal ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than a flashy show  
when they finally get to see their hero , wcw world champion jimmy king ( played by oliver platt  
i personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king ) , he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair ( a wasted palitaliano , in a role originally meant for real-life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later , and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff , they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it ) , they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his title back  
when they find him , they discover in horror that jimmy king's real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv  
king is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king  
after convincing king that they don't care that his persona isn't real , gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro , after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcw's pay-per-view  
gee , whiz , there are so many things wrong with this movie , i don't know where to begin  
yes , i do    
1  the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff , wcw president who thought up this project , thinks of wrestling fans  
he thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously  
he actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously  
i got news for you , eric : nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that , this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 ! 
i know he'll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn't meant to be taken seriously but it is , because that's how big an ego bischoff has  
2  there was a documentary made in 1998 , wrestling with shadows , that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation , vince mcmahon's screwing bret "" the hitman "" hart out of the title  
this movie's storyline is basically a comic rip-off of that plot with the poor man's wayne and garth thrown in  
eric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair , but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon , and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart  
3  
the movie's main wrestler , jimmy king , has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him  
no wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age , we want bad asses today ! 
4  why make this a comedy , instead of an emotional , rocky-style drama ? 
i know wrestling isn't a sport , but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end  
5  
in the movie , gordie starts up an ill-fated romance with nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan  
what she sees in that freak marilyn manson i'll never understand ) , only to find that she has hospitalized king's trainer for sinclair  
wouldn't it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy-girl-for-the-bad-guy cliche ? 
i hate that  
6  
last , but certainly not least , there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen , nor did i laugh once either  
the world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie , for these reasons : 
1  they're the better promotion  
2  they have better and younger talent , performers and wrestlers  
3  
they give their fans what they want and don't treat them like idiots  
4  they're winning the ratings and they're the promotion everybody cares about "

that very evening , the couple is married and fall madly in love soon thereafter  
but what's this ? 
one of them might not be the person they are pretending to be ? 
wow    a 
sin , indeed  
critique : easily one of the worst movies that i've seen all year  
too long , too boring , too predictable and too ridiculous for anyone interested in watching a good movie  
what the hell were they thinking when they made this thing ? 
 ( it's no wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for about a year ) this felt like a really bad tv movie of the week , with some nudity stuffed in from time to time , just to wake up the audience  
have you ever switched channels and fallen upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies , one that you just couldn't help but switch back to from time to time , just to make sure that it wasn't part of some sick joke ? 
well , this movie is exactly like that , only it isn't a joke , it isn't on tv and you are asked to pay money to see it ! ! 
i say again    what the shite were they thinking ? 
okay , so where do i start ? 
first of all , the trailer of this film gives away the movie's main plot twist , the betrayal  
so for the first half hour of the film , you're basically just sitting there , watching these two "" lovers "" go through the motions until the "" betrayal "" occurs  
whoopee , big surprise  
second of all , angelina jolie is horribly miscast in this part  
why ? 
well , it's like this : not for one second do you ever believe that she is not a nasty backstabbing woman ! 
i mean , it's like all of those people who complained about jack nicholson being psycho from the start of the shining , well , the same goes here  
every look in jolie's eyes screams "" psycho "" ! 
then of course , you have the case of the "" patsy "" husband , a man who just can't seem to figure out anything in time  
i mean    how 
boring is that for the audience ? 
you're watching this guy screw up time after time after time , and somehow , we're supposed to feel sorry or care about this dude  
no , thanks ! 
and if we don't care about him , and we really don't care about her ( she's a beeyatch and as confused as we are about her actual motivations in the film ) , who the hell are we supposed to care about in this film ? 
well , i'll tell you  
the only thing that i was worrying about the whole way through this picture was whether or not i'd actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled  
no suspense , no chemistry between the leads , no real love or passion , no sense of surprise , plenty of plot holes for everyone and an extra moronic ending  
so why am i even giving this film a rating of three points ? 
well , it's actually pretty simple  
i liked the locations in the movie and the groovy score , but my primary reason for slipping three notches onto this bedpost is for the gratuitous shots of jolie's boobies ( that's two points right there ! ) and another one for antonio's ass ( hairless , just for the record )  
everything else in this movie was pointless , boring and just plain stupid  
try imagining a soft-porn movie    but 
without the plot ! 
that's pretty much what you've got here

-1,"the u  s  army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done  
one particular field manual is known as the fm 22-5 , which among other things , covers the practice of saluting  
under the "" saluting "" section is a sub-section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer  
the salute is rendered by the highest-ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail , and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail  
in any event , the salute is rendered only by the man ( or woman ) in charge , rather than by the whole group  
almost at the very beginning of the general's daughter , we see a general's motorcade passing a work detail  
everyone salutes  
it looked impressive , but it just wasn't right  
that little bit showed me that someone either didn't do the appropriate research , or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene  
in fact , this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture , as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie  
what results is a film that looks good , but like that one scene , just isn't right  
the first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example  
paul brenner ( john travolta ) is an agent for the army's criminal investigation division , undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale  
prior to the transaction , the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isn't the unscrupulous supply sergeant he's supposed to be , and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living  
so ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark ( we'll just say that it involves propellers )  
brenner then receives new orders when the commanding general's daughter , captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , is found naked , bound , and dead on one of the base's training ranges  
he is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder  
what i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary  
it gives no insight into brenner , other than the fact that he's a little cocky  
does the arms subplot turn up later ? 
no , so why add this extra running time to the film ? 
the answer : it looked cool  
or how about the "" atmosphere "" ? 
the beginning of the general's daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees , dirt roads , sultry colors over water - all backed up with bayouesque music  
nice immersion in the setting , but it soon doesn't matter , for when the film's plot shifts over to the murder investigation , so does the entire mood  
no attention is paid to the location of the story , and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme  
did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ? 
instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film , we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another , just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside  
the above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie  
as i've already mentioned , an entire section of the film doesn't jibe with the rest , and the characterization only adds to the difficulty  
brenner , who comes across as a man with little respect for authority , suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell ( james cromwell ) and utters some of the corniest "" yes , sir "" s i've ever heard  
he even delivers an emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general's daughter , even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous  
sunhill , who initially comes across as a professional investigator , utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information , and even revels in her ingenuity  
both characters are protagonists , but it's hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place , and in some cases , simply unappealing  
i could imagine that during filming , west would shoot a scene , then take the actors aside and tell them , "" let's do it again , but this time , i want more  "" 
i say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good , in this film they overact in most of their scenes  
an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general's aide , colonel fowler  
i swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention  
a far cry from his days as linc in "" the mod squad "" , i can't help but think he was acting from west's direction  
a couple of side characters including a west point psychologist ( john beasly ) and a young female private ( ariyan a  johnson ) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear "

i only wish that i could pretend never to have seen this movie    
critique : trite , unfunny , boring and a waste of everyone's talent  
how a premise with such zest and bite can turn into a movie that doesn't feature any chemistry , any real laughs , any surprises or any spice is beyond me  
how julia roberts is used solely as a "" puppy dog "" character , puttering around in the background while we endure the complete bitchiness of zeta-jones' character , who is not one bit funny or romantic ( two ideal ingredients in a "" romantic comedy "" ) , is also beyond me  
and why they chose john cusack , a great , quirky actor in his own right , to play the most bland , uninteresting and unfetching character ( with zero chemistry with either of his leads ) is further more , beyond me  
and to anybody who decided that this project was "" funny "" enough to greenlight featuring the talents mentioned above , along with billy crystal , christopher walker , seth green and stanley tucci    well , 
what can i say    i 
just don't have the words  
so is this the worst movie that i've seen all year ? 
no  but it definitely sucks and it's basically because    well , 
it's just not funny  
and for the record , allow me to state a few more problems with it  
it starts off slow , it's got no energy , it doesn't engage you with any of its characters ( julia barely gets somewhat interesting in the film , everyone else    lame ! ) , it utilizes way too many flashbacks to move the story forward , it's utterly predictable , standard , routine , see-through and uninteresting as a plot and it just sits there on the screen , big and ugly , waiting    waiting for you to laugh or find something in it that is amusing  
and then hank azaria shows up    aaaaaah , the film's savior ( mind you , some might be offended by his exaggeration of a stereotype , but that's another story altogether )  
but when an experienced "" voice "" actor upstages all of the main stars in a summer "" blockbuster "" romantic comedy with an over-the-top antonio banderas accent , damn dude    your

-1,"in double jeopardy , the stakes are high  
think of the plot as a rehash of sleeping with the enemy , and then rearrange the details and the gender of the stalker  
the finished product , although able to maintain the viewer's attention , is a predictable and unexciting thriller with an idiotic script  
`alex , i'll take homicide for $400    ' 
libby parsons ( ashley judd ) is a happily married mom leading a normal life  
one night , her husband nick ( bruce greenwood ) takes her out for a romantic escape on a sailboat  
libby awakens in the middle of the night to find she is covered in blood and nick has strangely disappeared  
she follows a trail of bloody footprints up to the deck , where she handles a fallen knife ( like any stupid character ) and is spotted by the coast guard , who are responding to a distress signal sent earlier in the evening  
nick is presumed dead , and although she pleads her innocence , libby is tried and convicted for the murder of her husband  
now , please don't think i'm spoiling any vital plot details , because the informative trailer has already spilled most of the beans  
if you haven't seen this preview , don't read any further  
but seriously , the inane screenplay by douglas weisberg and douglas s  cook is so elementary that the average viewer will be two or three steps ahead of the characters  
during the most vital scenes in the movie , i was anticipating every twist or `surprise' that eventually popped up on the screen  
i imagine the writers presume their core audience for double jeopardy is a very naive group of individuals  
most , unfortunately , will be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few positive aspects of the production  
one is tommy lee jones , who plays travis lehman , a parole officer given the tedious task of watching over libby after she serves her sentence in prison  
jones is always wonderful as an authority figure , and he's certainly familiar with this sort of role ( as he played so well in the fugitive and us marshals )  
judd , as a likable heroin with gusto , also has a chance to flex her acting abilities  
while emotionally unconvincing , the actress is tremendously fun in her juvenile role , perking up the movie like an injection of anti-depressant  
the actors , and their relationship together , present the one-two punch that prevents double jeopardy from derailing itself entirely  
and now , back to the plot  
while behind bars , libby learns an interesting little bit of information : a person can't be convicted of the same crime twice  
this law , called `double jeopardy' , could be her motive for hunting down her husband    
who may still be alive  
yes , you heard right  
the movie degenerates into a cross-country chase , where everything you expect to happen    
does  
the final scenes , which could have redeemed the film , are poorly handled by director bruce beresford - whose previous work centers highly around drama ( driving miss daisy , paradise road )  
ironically , it is those elements - like the driving force of libby to reunite with her son - that don't quite work here  
at least double jeopardy is paced well enough to satisfy diehard fans of the two stars  
unfortunately , jones lacks some of the edge that he had as sam gerard in the fugitive , and the real depth of his character is only skin deep  
but he and ashley judd are more than welcome considering the material , and both have some memorable comic moments "

however , this simple blockade is not all it seems , and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers , including facing the evil darth maul ( ray park  ) 
they also meet the future darth vadar , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) 
star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking : script , direction and characters  
the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic  
the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star , and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non-existent  
there's no underlying tension , and no urgent need to see what the outcome is  
the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story , which doesn't help  
there's no snap to make the film work , it moves at a plod  
the script is boring : all the characters speak in morals , especially anakins mother  
there's no group spirit evident here , and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders , it's evident that not much is going to happen  
the two leads are hideously boring , static characters given little to do and too much time to do it  
qui-gon and obi-wan hold no presence on film , and give little for the audience to root for  
the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul , if he had been given more screen time  
maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history , even if he does provide the only 'straight' plot line in the film ( all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy  ) 
anakin is annoying and unlikeable  , 
instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended  
it's probably not surprising that his hateful little boy , unfortunately blessed 'ani' by everyone he knows , joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible  
the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks , although in the end none is provided in the film by him  
although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys , the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny  
the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a 'pod' racer , because i knew he wouldn't be able to talk for a while  
queen amidala is a nothing in the film , she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must 'serve her people , ' and go goo-goo over anakin  
again , her role will become more important in the later episodes , and is given little to do here  
the actors don't help the movie much either  
liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed , and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible  
mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy , with little charm  
the casting director must have chose him because he's scottish like alec guinness : there's little other explanation for it  
natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script , but she delivers a spunky performance  
and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice  
there's very little talent evident with him , it's hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there  
he's not even very 'cute  ' 
the main claim of the film , the special effects , are okay  
there's nothing impressive about them , yet they complement the story well  
the cgi takes away much of the human element , however "

wild wild west 
a better name for this movie might've been "" wild wild waste ""  
warner bros  , in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie , had managed to lasso in some big names ( actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , the duo behind mib's success ) in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster , a contemporary big-screen update to the classic western/sci-fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad  
but somehow , they ran into a problem along the way  
they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would've made all the difference- a story writer  
wild wild west's story and script was compiled by six different people , rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black , ed solomon  
if warner bros  had gotten him , the movie would've possibly been five times better than what it is  
heck , ten times  
as is , however , the story and screenplay is a mess , filled with dead laughs , enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he's performing them , and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well  
here's the story : us army member james west ( will smith ) teams up with creative genius artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , whose lower half was blown off during the civil war , leaving him to roll around in a steam-controlled wheelchair  
they catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an 80-foot tarantula ( although it looks bigger than that ) , hellbent on destroying anything in its path  
as i said , the way the script unfolds is a complete mess  
but the acting doesn't help either  
kevin kline is miserable as gordon , failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado  
smith seems to be having a better time as west , although he's not nearly as charming as he was in mib  
branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain , perhaps to the point where we can't even stand to look at him or his strange beard  
and salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father , but mostly she exists just for sexual attention  
her acting is barely passable , but what a "" breath of fresh ass ""  
director barry sonnenfeld isn't of great help either  
even though he shows some good creativity at some points , his overall urgency for directing is lost  
it's as if he feels he's directing a tv movie , a big no-no when you're helming what's supposed to be a big-screen hit  
last but not least , there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable  
at one point , smith defies gravity when first boarding kline's train  
he jumps on the back , gets launched straight up in the air , and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train- while it's still in motion ! 
also , he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob , particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks  
last but not least , why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he's not kissing a woman as he's looking through a peephole at the enemy ? ! 
the only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects  
the huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel , very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show  
there's also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades , but , again , a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity  
i would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west , but it really isn't possible  
if the racist and sex jokes don't bother you , the performances will  
if the performances don't bother you , the story will  
if the story doesn't bother you , the racist and sex jokes will  
there's no end to the vicious circle  
go rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats  
you'll have a better time  
if you do go , keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant  
i bet he wishes he were somewhere else   "

-1," "" there's nothing new under the sun "" is a phrase often used when the speaker actually means "" let's find something to copy  "" 
of course there are very few completely original ideas  
even earth-shattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience  
there is , after all , no need to re-invent the wheel time after time  
recently it seems that hollywood doesn't feel the need to even re-write the script  
my understanding of the word "" sequel "" is a continuation of the story  
the film industry has defined the word to mean reshooting the original with minor changes  
have an overwhelming desire to see an inferior version of brian depalma's adaptation of the steven king novel ? 
this is your dream come true  
rachel ( emily bergl ) , a high school outcast , is beginning to notice weird things happening around her  
doors slam shut by themselves  
glass globes blow up  
her mother has severe mental problems and her father is absent  
a popular boy unexpectedly asks her out  
the in-crowd conspires to embarrass her at a public event  
any of this sound familiar ? 
once the audience catches on that this is the same story as "" carrie "" , there's little to do but wait for the inevitable ending  
the effects are a bit better this time around , but the film doesn't work nearly as well  
there are a couple of minor plot differences  
rachel lives with foster parents because her mother is institutionalized  
the boys at her school are portrayed as even more evil than in the original  
they keep score of their scoring with points given for each conquest  
and , uh , there must be other story changes but none stand out  
one nice touch is the casting of amy irving again as sue snell  
over 20 years ago she was the one girl who tried to help carrie  
now a high school counselor , she befriends rachel , but her character's potential is squandered  
there's too much about sue that doesn't make sense  
after the slaughter when carrie kills most of her classmates , sue is driven mad and spends time in the institution that rachel's mother is in  
still living in the same small town , the woman with a well-known history of mental problems is hired as a high school counselor ? 
sue tells rachel that her telekinesis is a genetic disease  
this may be the one original idea in the film , but the reasoning behind describing psychic powers as a "" disease "" is never explained  
sue's eventual fate is an admission by director katt shea and writer rafael moreu that they had an interesting character but couldn't figure out what to do with her  
blink and you'll miss it  
some of the events are filmed in black and white , but the rationale for this is unknown  
it doesn't add anything and the choice of scenes appears somewhat random  
 "" the rage "" retains some of the trappings of "" carrie "" without the meaning  
in the first film the color red was a motif connected to carrie's onset of powers at the same time she began menstruating  
here there's an abundance of red , but for no apparent purpose  
the casting of high school jocks and cheerleaders as villains is beginning to wear thin  
one might be lead to suspect that most filmmakers were unpopular in school and the history of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge of the nerds  
the biggest mistake the film makes is including clips of the original  
seeing sissy spacek on the screen only points to the quality of that film - and the flaws in this one "

-1,"certainly no one would rent ed wood's glen or glenda ? 
expecting to see a good movie , but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didn't know was possible  
in fact , wood's infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison  
watching glen or glenda ? 
i found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together ; as a result , it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious  
the movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary , with endless , repetitive narration about transvestites , how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriend's clothes without being able to wear them , how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals , and how the main character , glen/glenda is ( as it reminds us probably half a dozen times ) "" not half man and half woman , but man and woman at the same time  "" 
the camera work is terrible-occasionally the camera lingers on , say , a closed door while the characters talk off-screen , or inexplicably zooms in on someone's ear or nose  
wood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage , which leads to voiced-over non-sequiturs like , "" yes , our world is a busy and frightening place , with so many people driving their automobiles  "" 
finally , there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit a frankenstein-style laboratory , delivering pointless lines such as , "" people  
  
  
all with their own thoughts  
  
  
their own ideas  
  
  
  "" 
while lightning crackles quasi-ominously overhead  
had wood continued in this vein , glen or glenda ? 
probably would have been remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentary with the occasional inappropriate horror-movie touch  
unfortunately , he then wanders so far off into left field that you have to wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms when he wrote the script  
 "" pull the string ! 
pull the string ! "" 
announces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears  
there is another crash of lightning before lugosi returns , this time warning us , "" beware  
  
  
beware the big green dragon that lurks outside your door ! 
  
  
  
it eats little boys  
  
  
and puppy dogs' tails  
  
  
and big fat snails ! "" 
a bizarre nightmare sequence , which is probably meant to be symbolic but instead is just incredibly stupid , ensues , during which glen/glenda finds his fiance trapped under a fallen tree-in the living room  
someone who is apparently intended to be the sinister "" green dragon "" ( but looks more like a klingon from the original star trek series ) appears to be orchestrating all this , though the film is far from clear on this point ( to put it kindly )  
near the end of this scene-and here i must confess that wood lost me completely-is a violent sexual encounter on a couch that features two characters who do not even appear in the rest of the movie and is scored by goofily upbeat folk music  
after this scene ends ( not a moment too soon ) , glen or glenda ? 
returns to its documentary style , but at that point any lingering sense that wood had the slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone  
the film wanders to a dumb happy ending that also seems to abandon much of what it was trying to say about transvestitism , but at that point it didn't matter much what happened  
as soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over , glen or glenda ? 
had pretty much cemented its place in my mind as the most incoherent film i had ever seen  
i honestly think that if i picked up my camcorder and deliberately tried to make the worst movie i possibly could , it still might not match glen or glenda ? 
for sheer cinematic disaster "

my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program  
true , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it's a cartoon  
but it's a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen  
but my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ? 
turns out i was right , mostly  
inspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick  
at first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver  
this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where "" formula "" isn't just business , it's a way of life  
the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits  
in some parts you can just hear them saying "" more zany ! 
i want more zany here -- and -- here  "" 
 "" let's have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful  
i want the audience squirming in their seats  "" 
 "" ok , that's fine , but i want you to add bug guts  "" 
 "" what does this scene do ? 
character depth ? 
but where's the zaniness ? 
i don't see zany here  
if you can't make it zany , cut it ! "" 
the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie  
michelle ( who plays penny , gadget's niece ) shines in every scene she's in , but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time  
my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor  
dabney coleman's comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby  
i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes  
he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the "" gidget bitch from hell "" town mayor  
oteri's overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon's own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn't poking fun at our fair town  
or , maybe all career politicians are like that  
i must say , matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla  
he appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget  
rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw  
joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself  
her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film  
d  l  hughley plays the shuckin'-and-jivin' vehicular side-kick , in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years  
the dialog is    let's face it , it's pretty bad  
the tag-line after a major set-piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context  
a lot of the lines ( especially hughley's ) appear to be made up as they go along , by people with little gift for ad-lib  
about three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw  
gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations ( not really "" battles "" ) with the evil gadget  
penny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon "

starring tim roth , pruitt taylor vince , bill nunn , clarence williams iii  
rated r  
the legend of 1900s is the year's most absurd movie , a rambling , nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast  
it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth , looking wistful as ever , as a guy named    
1900  
you heard right  
his name is , in all actuality , 1900  
he was born on an ocean liner on 1/1/1900 ( uh , hence the name ) , abandoned and adopted by danny , a ship crewman  
1900 spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of danny's fear that he might be taken away from him because of "" visa matters  "" 
well , when 1900 is about 9 or so , he starts wondering all around the ship  
one day , he discovers a grand piano  
he sits down and starts playing  
miraculously , what comes out is beautiful  
a group of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age  
when one of the people who knows 1900 tells him that his playing the piano like that without permission is "" totally against regulations "" 1900 replies "" f * ck the regulations ! "" 
ho ho ho  
1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land  
when he's about 30ish and can play the piano like nobody's business , onboard comes another musician  
his name is max ( pruitt taylor vince ) and he plays the trumpet  
after 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during a storm , he sits him down on the piano next to him , takes the piano's braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall , taking them with it  
how the chair they're sitting on and the piano don't separate , i don't know , but this apparently isn't the kind of thing we're supposed to ask  
after that , 1900 and max become friends  
max is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land , but 1900 has no intention of doing so  
what's more , he doesn't even want his music to go anywhere without him : when a record company hears about his talents , they come on board to make a record of his music , but after finding out that -- gasp ! 
-- they're going to make millions of copies , he breaks the record  
the conflict of the movie is that after max , unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship , gets off himself , he stumbles upon a record of 1900's music in a store  
the record shouldn't exist because a ) 1900 never stepped on dry land and b ) the one record that was made on the ship was broken  
ladies and gentlemen , it's a mystery ! 
the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements  
we're supposed to be roused by a climactic    
piano duel ? 
there isn't anything in this movie with the potential to compel  
1900 comes off as a whiny , brooding , extremely unlikable man : i can't recall a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo- meditation on life  
ditto for max , who doesn't seem to have a life outside his friendship with 1900  
tim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf ; there's no spirit , no gusto to the character  
he insists that he leads a happy life on the ship , but to us he is dead  
pruitt taylor vince is a little more palatable , at least providing a moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up a bit  
the highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant , leering "" king of jazz "" who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel "

before this film , the game had a few spin-off cartoons- which were ok  
but the idea of doing a movie is insane  
it should have been animated , if it should have been done at all  
instead the people do the best they can with a talented cast  
yet it still fails  
the plot is completely different from the game's plot- i'm not complaining about that  
the story involves the mario bros  having a plumbing business in brooklyn and having to compete with a rival company  
eventually they find a construction site by their nemesis , which happens to be enviromentally un-safe  
so , due to luigi's ( john leguizamo ) girlfriend - princess daisy - they go and investigate  
they get transported to a blade runner-esque world lead by king koopa ( dennis hopper )  
somehow a plot dealing with all the dinosaurs being mutated and transported to an alternate futuristic mega-city jumbles in  
the plot is fine- better than the movie deserves  
the acting is ok  
this seems to be more of a visual film  
the special effects are good , especially on the robotic yoshi  
however the film drags and is no fun  
and it leaves itself open to a sequel , which probably won't ever be made  
this movie begins sort of promising , but ends up leaving a weird taste in your mouth  
so if you want to watch a sort of odd movie starring the excellent dennis hopper , then watch super mario bros  : 
the movie  
you could do worse  
but you could definitely do better    
  
street fighter : the movie ( 1995 ) starring : raul julia and jean claude van-damme 
this movie was based off of a series of never ending sequels to a game called street fighter 2  it has all the characters from the game in a reasonable plot  
it is more like a "" movie "" than it should be  
yes , it's watchable  
raul julia does a good job , considering this was his final film  
while the game had non-stop fighting sequences , this movie is a hodge-podge of action scenes and flashy sets and costumes while trying to show off a plot at the same time  
does it work ? 
sort of    
the plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by m  bison ( raul julia )

-1,"all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood  
ultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996's other , underperforming disaster films ( dante's peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year  
but , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank  
no number of name changes can help this picture  
it's not just about a disaster , it is a disaster  
hard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute  
the best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises  
the community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies  
from that moment on , it's all downhill  
whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point  
it takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured  
basically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs  
there's a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions  
it's all very routine and uninteresting because there aren't any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense  
the film's conclusion is so preposterous that it's almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around  
action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion  
graham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle  
unfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it  
the action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition  
we see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc  -- over and over again  
the movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length  
the storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances  
there's tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash  
he and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv's "" lou grant "" ) , get stuck on a street that's rapidly turning into a river  
a group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers  
after charlie is killed in a shoot-out , tom hides the money , then runs  
as he swims and boats his way through huntingburg's roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives  
there isn't any real acting in this film  
christian slater utters a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera  
tom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen  
randy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing  
morgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but they are defeated by the script  
freeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time  
following in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn't trust nature's fury as the chief engine of conflict  
as a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had  
titanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water  
hard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible  
thus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) "

battlefield earth 
a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman 
in my mid-teen years , i had a horrendous re-occurring nightmare  
behind the wheel of a car , i was driving down a straight road in the middle of a desert  
no scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway  
no matter what i did , the view didn't change : travelling but not getting anywhere  
each time i awoke in a sweat , terrified  
you don't have to be carl jung to understand that dream  
powerless to make changes , trapped in a boring situation with no hope of rescue , this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake  
this is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after "" battlefield earth "" begins  
for all of its flash and style , l  ron hubbard's science fiction epic is the earliest and best entry for the dullest summer film of 2000  
dull "" and "" stupid  
in the year 3000 , the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for 1 , 000 years  
humans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as barbarians  
there's no hope  
the future is bleak  
then the psychlo make a mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry pepper ) who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl ( john travolta ) and the alien race  
it's an archetypal post-apocalyptic plot full of promise  
considering some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen , it's difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably  
but it does  
the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits  
are we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold , the psychlo never discovered fort knox ? 
or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time -- and gassed up ? 
or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships ?

-1,"spoiled rich kid kelley morse ( chris klein ) receives a new mercedes for a graduation present  
he and his buddies take it for a joyride to a small nearby town , where he proceeds to torment the locals simply because he's rich and they're not  
he ends up provoking jasper ( josh hartnett ) into a race and as a result , the local gas station and diner are destroyed when they crash into it  
kelley is sentenced to rebuild the diner , and has to live with jasper in a spare room over his family's barn  
jasper's girlfriend sam ( leelee sobieski ) soon takes a liking to kelley however , despite the fact that 1 ) it was her family's diner that was destroyed and b ) all kelley does is sit around , sulk , and smart off to the townspeople  
but when she sees him sweaty and shirtless , that's apparently all she needs to lose her feelings for jasper ( whose only fault seems to be a perpetual case of hat hair )  
so sobieski soon falls in love with kelley , especially after the day she follows him through the woods and hears him giving his graduation speech ( which he was unable to deliver because he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people )  
in the speech , kelley quotes a poem by robert frost , which just so happens to be sam's favorite poem as well  
awwwww  
soon they're frolicking around in the fields and for some reason waste no time letting people in town ( especially jasper's best friend ) see them together  
kelley continues to make an ass of himself in town , especially when he shows up at the town dance , drunk and steaming because sam went with jasper  
kelley runs off and decides to leave town  
sam catches up to him at the bus station and he asks her to come to boston with him  
jasper shows up and tearfully confesses to sam just how much he loves her , and sam , without even breaking stride basically says "" see ya ! "" 
and takes off to boston with kelley  
here on earth goes in so many wrong directions from the start that by the time its fairly decent ending comes around , its completely worthless  
chris klein and leelee sobieski are two of my current favorite young performers , and it's because of their presence that i watched this film in the first place  
however , not long into the proceedings i wanted to just reach into the film and strangle them both  
i shouldn't have such feelings towards people i like , but their characters are so infuriating that    
well trust me , you'll feel the same way  
even though both of the lead male characters are usually in the wrong , kelley is hands down the more unlikable of the two , simply because his jerkish actions are calculated  
he intends to be a jackass each and every time he does it  
jasper on the other hand , only reacts to kelley's provocations , and afterwards comes across as being truly sorry for his impulsive actions  
but , as in life , nice guys finish last  
for the entire film we watch sam fall in love with the guy no one likes while the film's only sympathetic character gets completely crushed  
then , a cancer subplot comes into play ( where things get even more infuriating , if you can imagine that )  
what , things weren't depressing enough for you mr  screenwriter ? 
who greenlit this project ? 
who "" on earth "" thought this would entertain anyone ? 
perhaps if the film had been structured where kelley perhaps felt some remorse after he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people  
but even after he's destroyed these people's lives he continues to be a snob to them , and ruins one more for good measure  
here on earth is available on dvd from fox home entertainment  
it contains the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1  85 : 1 and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions  
extras include jessica simpson's music video for "" where you are "" , a commercial for the film's soundtrack ( which by the way is the only good thing about the film ) , the original theatrical trailer and five tv spots , trailers for other fox releases ( anna and the king , anywhere but here , the beach , drive me crazy , ever after , romeo + juliet , simply irresistible ) , as well as that new fox promo touting their upcoming dvd releases that i really enjoy  
the picture and sound quality on the disc are fine    
nothing that will challenge anyone's audio/video systems of course  
fans of this movie ( if any exist ) should enjoy the dvd release "

-1,"godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the "" who cares about plot "" summer movie  
a loose remake of the 1954 "" classic "" japanese monster movie , godzilla , king of the monsters ( which is itself pretty thin in the story department ) , roland emmerich and dean devlin's big-budget lizard-stomps-manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind  
the script isn't just "" dumbed down , "" it's lobotomized  
godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone  
presumably , the primary target group for this film is teenage boys , the demographic most likely to shell out $7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster-instigated carnage  
that's not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction ; they're just not as readily susceptible  
this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer-generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors  
stargate was a financial success  
independence day was a runaway hit  
and , with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie-ins before it even opens , it's virtually guaranteed at least $100 million  
nice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not-too-precocious grade school kid  
godzilla isn't completely without merit , although it is close  
there's a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan , but it wears off quickly  
frankly , while the special effects are competent , they're not all that stunning  
there's nothing new here ; it's jurassic park meets aliens , with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure  
maybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer-generated visuals to the next level  
godzilla never really pushes the envelope , preferring to remain within a comfort zone  
the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass , formulaic approach which disallows creativity  
 ( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival ? ) 
worst of all , godzilla isn't even exciting  
with the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end , there isn't a sequence in this film that raises the pulse  
even the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn-provoking  
independence day may have been dumb , but it was full of "" adrenaline moments "" capable of getting the audience involved in the action  
in this aspect of its production , as in so many others , godzilla is lacking  
actually , part of the problem is that we're never sure who we're supposed to be rooting for : the green monster with an attitude or the paper-thin humans trying to stop him  
the plot , such as it is , can be summed up rather simply  
after sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands , godzilla shows up in the big apple  
he does some of the usual tourist things : stops by madison square garden , visits the chrysler building , goes on a walk through central park , and takes the subway  
in the process , he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs , but he never has trouble with traffic jams  
on hand to stop him is an elite u  s  army unit , led by a slightly less-arrogant-than-usual military man ( kevin dunn ) and a biologist named nick tatopoulos , who has a theory about godzilla  
in his opinion , the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific  
in nick's words , godzilla is "" a mutated aberration ? an incipient creature ? the first of its kind  "" 
as luck would have it , nick's old girlfriend , audrey ( maria pitillo ) , is a reporter based at a new york tv station  
along with her cameraman friend , animal ( hank azaria ) , she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla  
then , just when the military has rejected nick's theory about why godzilla is in new york , a member of the french secret service ( jean reno ) recruits him for a special assignment  
instead of stomping around tokyo this time , godzilla has chosen new york city  
unfortunately , manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies ( independence day , deep impact , armageddon ) that it's becoming boring  
the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong , but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall "

it's all mine ! "" 
--- a twisted priest ( charles huevelman ) hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana ( angela zimmerly ) looks on uninterested  
an evil presence , appropriately named the presence ( dj vivona ) , rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him  
for kicks , the presence likes to trick a human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and be systematically slaughtered  
when something goes wrong and one of the presence's recent victims escapes , the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is a threat that needs to be stopped  
they enlist the help of alison ( ramona midgett ) , a recent suicide victim , to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the nether-realm  
her mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was , an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed  
the king's sorcerer , amblyn ( who also lost his job ) , decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice  
during the downtime in his unemployment , amblyn decided to create a new dimension where sorcery , evil , and torture ruled  
abraham wished to follow his master into this new realm , so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love  
in this new realm , amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm  
after each murder , abraham would become stronger , until his power surpassed that of amblyn's  
because of the screw-up that allowed the recent escape , abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself  
as alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways , the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered  
if there's one thing i can't stand when i see a film , it's when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty  
films like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this , and now ice from the sun can be added to this list  
this film is essentially an 80 minute stalk-and-slash film ( following the dante's inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6 ) intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and ( supposedly ) haunting images , many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot  
if there aren't bizarre images floating past the screen , then we get pointless shots of a suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at a time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone  
compelling , but ultimately not  
the opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images  
the credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesn't pop up until near the end of the sequence  
when the opening credits began i thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and a interstitial from mtv2 had found its way to my tv  
at least the music in the film is pretty decent , made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features a song by ramona midgett  
at the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them ( and he talks like a darth vader clone without the heavy breathing )  
for some reason though , he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance  
one over-alled cretin handles the presence's gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel , then there's an inbred father ( dwight spurgin ) and his two inbred children ( mark kettler and jennifer poirrier-wallace ) that take care of a young woman who has been transformed into a half dog-half human mix with a shotgun , and of course a big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds  
why would you want to give responsibilities to a bunch of "" rednecks "" when you yourself had all of these cool powers ? 
and how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time ? 
i can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment  
the most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging/salting sequence  
the character in question , dana ( angela zimmely ) , has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated  
a priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken  
he picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken , taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever  
when she starts to leave , the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life , walks out , and makes like it wants to be crucified by her  
the presence starts to clap annoyingly ( which continues for the rest of the sequence ) until dana takes off with the strange creature following her  
when it finally catches up to her , she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ  
the box for the film claims "" because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture , parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18  
contains nudity and graphic violence ""  
while both is certainly true , there doesn't seem to be much of either in any large amounts  
besides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump , a semi-graphic self-surgery scene , and two instances of head trauma ( one run over and one melting ) , most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety  
as for nudity , it is very sparse , but at least we get to see angela zimmerly ( far and away the most attractive cast member ) before her body is bruised , torn , and bloodied by the dragging incident "

-1,"wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic proportions  
over black and white drawings , we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange , sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiation-induced mutation  
the "" original "" inhabitants of the earth , fairies and elves , return to populate the globe , along with their evil , mutant counterparts  
one day ( and i say "" one day "" not to be trite , but because that's exactly how it happened - no advance notice ) , a fairy queen gives birth to twins , one good and one evil  
the twins grow up to be powerful wizards , the good one embracing magic , and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire  
we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology  
as unoriginal as the premise is , i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out  
there's a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world , after all  
i soon learned , however , that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film  
once the transition was made from still art to color animation , an entirely different feel takes precedence  
rather than the epic saga promised by the narration , we get a goofy-looking world of a saturday morning cartoon  
not just the look , mind you , but all the zany sounds like >honk boing 
for years , blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good , since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined  
however , blackwolf now has a secret weapon : nazis  
yup , adolf hitler , the luftwaffe and the wehrmacht  
okay , not the real things , but an archival film his minions dug up  
projected into the sky for all to see , it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up  
before you know it , there are dead elves everywhere  
this is just as well  
the characters are so bad that the viewer doesn't care about any of them  
they're either silly , sappy , or both  
the dialog gets much of the credit for this  
an example is when avatar nonchalantly says , "" well , looks like my brother and i begin our final battle  "" 
not very formidable when he's also the guy who says , "" this is the biggest bummer of a trip i've ever been on  "" 
my favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can't fight back against the nazi-charged evil  
her response is , "" they have weapons and technology  
we just have love  "" 
suffice to say , the characters are strictly two-dimensional , and we therefore don't expect anything more than the obvious to happen  
which it does  
the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out , which is anticlimactic and disappointing  
please note that it is the action that is unexpected  
that it is disappointing is not  
the film couldn't settle on a particular mood  
it seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle  
scenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity  
the dramatics , which seem to occur at random , are overly staged and overly acted , detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned  
ralph bakshi , the director , makes an obvious attempt to get a message across in this film : hitler and the nazis were bad  
so who doesn't know this already ? 
well , maybe children  
okay , so you might say that this is a movie for children  
it's not "

-1,"the ads for "" batman and robin "" scream "" the event of the summer is here "" and that's the problem  
the producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it  
 "" batman and robin "" is 126 minutes of lavish sets , flashy costumes and big , confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance  
it's like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright , busy and visually diverting , but not very much fun  
it wasn't always this way  
tim burton's "" batman "" was an epic story of obsession and duality , of darkness and revenge  
the film , while far from perfect , was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel  
batman was a creepy , brooding creature of the night  
the joker , brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson , was at once charismatic and repellent  
batman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin , battling inner demons and one another over gotham city's breathtaking gothic skyline  
those days of the dark knight are gone , replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck  
 "" batman and robin "" has far more in common with the campy 60's batman tv show than with tim burton's tale of darkness  
the blame lies with director joel schumacher  
a former window-dresser , schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes  
unfortunately , when it comes time to have those people walk and talk , he hasn't the faintest notion of what to do  
 "" batman and robin "" is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it's often difficult to tell who's whacking who  
while the characters flail at each other , one-liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti  
a few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing , but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film  
 "" batman and robin "" doesn't merely lose momentum , it stalls out completely on several occasions  
it's rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one  
ironically , the parts of "" batman and robin "" that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing , and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne  
easily the best batman yet , clooney's expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn't even hint at  
the film's most effective scene is a tender , quiet exchange between clooney and alfred ( michael gough ) , bruce wayne's butler and surrogate father  
as for the other heroes , chris o'donnell's robin is enthusiastic , perky and horny as hell , while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl  
in a movie filled to the brim with major characters , the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne's girlfriend is puzzling  
i suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built-in nipples , shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight  
of course , the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that's where "" batman and robin "" really suffers  
as mr  freeze , arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years , spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion  
laboring under a ton of appliances , schwarzenegger looks as if he's having trouble even moving in his suit , let alone trying to act  
uma thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy  
she overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character ( it's apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain , s/he must be a cartoonish , bumbling nerd )  
once thurman transforms into the eco-psychotic poison ivy , she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss  
thurman fails to maintain the character's maniacal sense of style though , and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film  
the biggest lesson to be learned from "" batman and robin "" is that more is not better  
joel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy ; but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is  
some critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam  
i don't think so  
my prescription ? 
fire joel schumacher ( but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist's convention so he'll understand that there's no hard feelings ) "

-1,"there're so many things to criticize about i don't know where to start  
recommendation : turn off your brain - don't be like me , decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much  
a comet is about to strike earth , causing a catastrophe similar to the extinction level event ( e  l  e  ) that wiped out the dinosaurs  
what follows is the story of a president's bid to think for the good of his people , a rising reporter , the love story of two teenagers ( one of whom discovered the comet ) , and a team of astronauts on the ship `messiah' to save the world  
firstly , there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film ( nor is there anything outstandingly good about it ) , but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid  
to be honest , i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself ( which isn't saying much )  
mimi leder's follow-up to `the peacemaker' is equally incompetent , with all the big stars wasted  
 ( perhaps i'm just annoyed that the release of `the peacemaker' in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller , `the assignment'  ) 
it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision , but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives  
however , the film simply fails on that note  
the effects are worn-out , the substandard screenplay limited the acting , and the director continued her sad run in terms of good-film-making credentials  
she's still making good money though  
t ? a leoni's unfortunate character , the news reporter , is the foundation of the story and of the cast  
but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored  
robert duvall's aging astronaut is lifeless , and morgan freeman's president is restricted to , well , a righteous president ( which means he's not interesting at all )  
leoni's character is the only appealing one , and is played with reasonable conviction ( but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc ) , but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters  
warning : spoilers included ( but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway )  
plot holes , plot holes , plot holes  
now , e  l  e  
is threatening to exterminate more than 99% of the human race , and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there ? 
where's the logic ? 
leder could have at least made it plausible with 20  
and then it turns out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish , and those less selfish ones ( the ones that stayed at home ) were the victims  
the film was almost mocking them , telling them they had died for nothing  
i also fail to see how two teenagers , carrying a baby , would be the first to climb up the mountain/hill , even with a motorbike for a head-start  
it's unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle , but that doesn't really matter  
building caves was a strategy mentioned in `dr  
strangelove' , which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years  
now that is a more practical use for caves  
what is the point of living in caves ? 
there is no , unlike `dr  
strangelove' , any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure  
how do plants grow ? 
if humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves , there's no reason why they can't do it in the open  
the president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves  
obviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago , and you can't be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media  
in an important mission like that of the `messiah' , for that matter any mission , it is impossible that isn't sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres , needless to say tens of kilometres  
this is not deep impact ? it's a frivolous cheap impact "

the problem is , i can't remember them as i write this review  
that's not a good sign  
in booty call , jamie foxx is bunz , a character whom i can't really describe , because i don't know that much about him  
i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk , and that he doesn't like relationships , just "" booty calls "" at three in the morning ( no questions , no commitment )  
bunz has a best friend named rushon ( tommy davidson ) , who seems to be bunz's direct opposite : on the straight and narrow , and currently in a long-term commitment ( a whole seven weeks , wow ! )  
rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend , nikki ( tamala jones ) , but for a reason which is not totally explained , it's going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki's friend lysterine ( vivica a  fox ) , who have never met  
to make a long story short , the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki's obsession with safe sex  
first she wants condoms , so bunz and rushon go out and get them  
oh , no , they have to be latex , not lambskin  
back to the store  
now they've got to get dental dams , or there'll be no foreplay  
why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand ? 
nikki phones lysterine , who lives across the hall , and tells her she'd better be making these demands , too  
talk about coitus interruptus  
booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over-the-top comedies  
the difference between the two is that in the latter , things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality  
in this category , for example , you have ace ventura : private eye on the mild side , and airplane ! 
at the extreme  
there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status , but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention  
it is disappointing , and even worse , distracting  
there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker ( are those real names ? ) 
does not live up to its potential , as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing  
for instance , there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant  
bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese , much to everyone's surprise  
however , when asked how he learned the language , he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late-night kung-fu films , and soon gained mastery  
this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene  
if , on the other hand , when asked how he learned to speak chinese , bunz simply replied with , "" kung-fu movies , "" and then moved on , the joke would have been much more effective  
this is because it would have been totally unbelievable , but funny because we know it is unbelievable  
by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible , the film is not giving its viewers enough credit  
the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions  
why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends ? 
why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine ? 
if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex , why doesn't she have some condoms at her own apartment ? 
these questions are not answered by the screenplay , but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward  
a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language  
some movies use a lot of swear words , but use them under very justifiable circumstances , as when they are employed consistent with a character's pattern of speech  
other films , such as the recent jackie brown , use them in ways that almost parody themselves  
booty call just sticks them in to get laughs , and it doesn't work  
they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them  
half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason  
the chinese restaurant , a holdup at a convenience store , and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story , and are in there for filler  
this is surprising , considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long  
it's too bad that the core of the film isn't much better , since it is comprised of sometimes funny , but forgettable dialog "

on the day it premiered , lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block , some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater  
they need not have wasted their time  
the movie is billed as a comedy , but is surprisingly bereft of humor  
there are noticeable attempts at laughs , but very few tries actually click  
i wondered if there were jokes that i wasn't getting because i'm not from china , but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn't be attributed to the cultural barrier either  
keep cool just isn't very funny  
the prelude to the film was a visit by keep cool's producer who , with the help of an interpreter , regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time , an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii  
although the print made it , the assistant's luggage was lost  
too bad that story wasn't in the movie , because it got a big laugh  
qu ying , the film's female lead , was also on hand to give a few comments  
however , whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed , ms  ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one , fast-paced , incredibly long tirade  
it was dizzying ; good foreshadowing for the film  
you see , keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes  
at least that's the way it seems , since the camera is constantly moving  
cinema verite is one thing , but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another  
although some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing , i found it thoroughly distracting , and after a while , quite annoying  
headache , as i said  
the film is about a young bookseller ( wen jiang ) who is after a young woman ( qu ying )  
they used to be romantically involved , but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship  
the first half of the film is about the young man's plan to win her back  
of course the thing is , she doesn't want to be won back , and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit  
in the fight , the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker , but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost  
we later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced  
there is a funny scene ( the only one in the film ) where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner ( baotian li ) in order to recoup his losses  
there is no sense to be made out of the young woman's behavior ; cold one minute , caring the next , so we feel no sympathy for her character  
the bookseller would be better off without her  
although the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well , who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner's hand as revenge for the beating he took , it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man  
while the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge , the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation  
his quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with , but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time  
a friendship develops between the two men , but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate  
although only an hour and a half in length , keep cool contains extraneous material  
the whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out , since we don't see her from the midpoint on  
a case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner , and would have saved us from the bookseller's boring pursuit during the first half  
but of course , this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour  
there are a few things that keep cool does right  
as mentioned before , the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good  
although it grows tiresome , the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic , and represents the differences in thinking between generations "

-1,"warning : may contain slight mild spoilers  
rated : r for intense violence/gore , some strong sexuality and language  
starring : arnold schwarzeneggar , robin tunney , rod stieger , gabriel byrne  
running time : 132 minutes 
we go into a movie theater , boom ! 
the lights go down , our hearts race , we go through ten minutes of preview and finally the movie we've been waiting to see for a long time comes on  
we sit there , watch in disbelief that this movie is as bad as it is  
why shouldn't i have know what i was getting myself into  
again like this past summers hit "" stigmata "" , "" end of days "" may be worse  
it's not like this is any kind of original idea , it just throws in some "" rosemary's baby "" , along with "" the devil's advocate "" a little "" exorcist "" and some "" stigmata "" here and there  
whala you have "" end of days "" a movie that is extremely disappointing and by the previews made it look terrific  
sadly but truly again like most recent films , all the good parts are in the trailers  
the plot which is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous and the movie is destined to be a hit in the first weekend , and flop in the next  
jericho cane ( arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role ) is a cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan ( living in gabriel byrnes body ) and stop him from impregnating christine york ( robin tunney ) because if he does , and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease to exist  
he has to do this before it turns into the year 2000 , and strangely he's trying to fight him 5 minutes before 2000 comes  
he seeks help from the catholic church and help from rod stieger ( in a terrific role ) and tries to save this girl leading to an ending that's satisfying , but turns into a typical action movie  
that's pretty much it on plot  
it does have the razzle and dazzle of a great action movie , and with the 100m dollar budget parts seem to show it , parts you have to wonder where all the money went  
as for arnie ? 
good role , ok performance  
i think since he is getting a little older he is held back a lot of his stunts  
the thing that disappointed me was the fact that there was nothing to the film  
in the trailers it looks like a good scary , action film and ends up being a boring , long and preposterous drama that leads into something else that leaves us with questions  
gabriel byrnes ( who ironically played a priest in "" stigmata "" ) here plays satan and gives a good performance but again seems held back and not into his character  
two years back al pacino gave a terrific performance in the fun "" the devil's advocate "" and here it seems like the idea of him is in the character also  
robin tunney ( great performance as always ) plays satan's main person whom he wants to impregnate to carry his child  
of course rod stieger gives another great performance which really isn't nothing new  
the direction by peter hyams is at times a bit overblown , though not nearly as the visual style was in "" stigmata ""  
here we are given great camera work , and some great scenes that are terrifically directed but sadly just don't work in this movie  
the script written by andrew marlowe has a few witty lines , but again the movie is all style and no substance and by the ending finale climax i was ready to go home  
only a few things work here and those are a few of the performances , the writing and visual style , but the storyline and the finished product don't work as well  
the sad thing is that "" end of days "" had so many things going for it  
the plot could have been more organized , the action scenes could have been more brainy and less mind-numbing  
at times it seems like "" armageddon "" and started to get old and tiresome  
hollywood is running out of ideas bad , and like i've always said before needs new ones  
even with its 100m budget "" end of days "" is less than pleasing  
in fact the 100m dollar budget is at least 30m over , and easily could have had a 70m budget  
maybe i sound crazy , but i am really looking forward to the new exorcist film , and hope that they make it as good as the original  
we need to get new ideas and stop recycling old ones just to make money at the box-office  
we need to get more films like "" the blair witch project "" that could scare people to death , while people thinking well what exactly is scaring them and how do i know that it is in fact the blair witch  
overblown effects , stupid and thin plot-line , good performances , disappointing  "
-1," "" america's sweethearts "" has an intriguing premise and a great cast , but it isn't nearly as edgy or funny as it should be  
almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer billy crystal , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting "" comic relief "" charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence )  
crystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous  
 "" america's sweethearts "" takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters  
it's a promising set-up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation  
by the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed  
john cusack and catherine zeta-jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria ) , a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp  
of the last nine films eddie and gwen made together , six crossed the $100 million mark , but the prospects for their final effort , a space opus titled "" time over time , "" are far from rosy  
while eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup , gwen's solo films have tanked  
to make matter worse , the director of the movie ( christopher walken ) , a "" visionary "" who purchased the unabomber's cabin and had it moved to his backyard , is withholding the film from the studio , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket  
desperate to win over the press , the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal ) , a recently fired publicist , to salvage the situation  
lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation  
he enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts ) , gwen's sister , personal assistant and whipping girl  
what lee doesn't know is that kiki is in love with eddie , a fact that could temper her effectiveness  
press junkets are a haven for control freaks  
studios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel , with food and drink always at hand  
generally , on the evening of their arrival , writers are bussed to see the featured film , then ferreted straight back to the hotel  
the next day , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews  
every 30 minutes or so , a producer , director , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things  
the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression ? writers are free to ask what they want , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question , they may not be invited to future junkets  
representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions  
they get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew , with the studio filming the exchanges  
the "" reporters "" are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars , but to play it safe , the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs  
placing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired , but the screenplay undermines the conceit  
the junket is moved from the handsome , but highly confining , four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas  
for most of the film , the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds , completely safe from the eyes of the press  
when they do deal with journalists , the "" it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters "" premise is de-clawed  
gwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll , they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and , at the screening of the movie , everyone connected with the film goes nuts , all without any repercussions  
lee certainly isn't bothered by any of the infantile outbursts ; in fact , he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids  
is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors ? 
hell no ? they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie  
all of which underscores how billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise : the comedy in "" america's sweethearts "" is based on barely-in-control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters , except that it doesn't matter because any publicity is good publicity  
and thus the very set-up for the film implodes , leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter  
so what about the cast ? 
julia roberts , at her best playing the underdog , is utterly charming here , although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit ( and not a very convincing one , by the way )  
catherine zeta-jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic  
by casting himself as the publicist , billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on "" comic relief "" - stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks  
in supporting roles , hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed "" too broad  "" 
seth green is amusing as a toadie , stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair , though he has little to work with  
come to think of it , "" little to work with "" is the operative phrase for this movie  
as a hollywood satire , "" america's sweethearts "" is toothless "

-1,"when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions , i turned to my friend and said , "" dangerous liaisons for kids ! "" 
it was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense , owing everything it is to stephen frears' 1988 masterpiece  
imagine my surprise to see that writer/director roger kumble has given credit to his source material : choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits  
and i was impressed  
in fact , i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film , which is an appalling excuse for a movie  
it's kiddie-porn hackwork , complete with earthy sex-talk and fully-clothed hand-jobs  
i suppose this kind of movie was inevitable ; with all the teen high-school angst movies coming out , there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they're smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined  
cruel intentions is a mess in every possible way , and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to : i hated all the characters , and i hate everything they do  
i also hate ryan phillippe , so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be  
phillippe plays ( check out this name ) sebastian valmont  
wow  
isn't that a memorable name ? 
i could just say it over and over again  
sebastian valmont  
it kind of rolls off the tongue , in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich  
sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no woman he can't have , no material object out of his reach  
he has all the money , all the sex -- all at his fingertips  
and , luckily , his parents never enter into his life -- no , in the world of cruel intentions , adults don't really exist  
the ones who do are irritating  
sebastian valmont lives with his stepsister , kathryn merteuil ( sarah michelle gellar ) , the bitch-queen of the universe , and also the woman every man wants  
since these two rich kids are so bored , they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons  
kathryn wants sebastian valmont to de-virginize cecile caldwell ( selma blair ) , a naive dork-chick who has somehow wronged kathryn  
but it's too easy for sebastian valmont -- he wants to nail annette hargrove ( reese witherspoon ) , the "" paradigm of chastity and beauty  "" 
so , sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal ( which is too explicit to state here )  
but -- dear god ! 
-- sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove  
dangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable , and because of its masterful acting  
cruel intentions is bad for many reasons , but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting  
kathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch , a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her  
she is supposed to be mean , but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons  
gellar , while aesthetically pleasing , is one-dimensional and utterly repulsive  
witherspoon has a truly beautiful face , but her character isn't the moral staple she's supposed to be : sure , she won't have sex until she's in love ( is this really a * moral * issue ? ) , but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible  
but i can't forget mr  phillippe , who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable , invulnerable blandness  
i have to give him credit and say that he did , in fact , manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions  
and there's one point in the film in which he shouts , thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone  
true , he is bad , but it doesn't help that he has no character to work with  
kumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character , leaving us with a sex-crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch  
the film fails in every other way , too  
first of all , nobody talks like this  
even the "" intellectuals "" i know don't bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering  
for a while , the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs , but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there's no way we can join it "
-1,"about an hour or so into "" the jackal , "" a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence , and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out "" i hope she gets killed now ! "" 
at that point it hit me : i didn't care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn't really like  
when the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he's being played by sidney poitier , you know something's rotten in the state of denmark  
every year , a couple films like this are released  
you know : the cheap , action packed international espionnage film , featuring a semi-promising premise , some big-name actors ( usually bruce willis ) , and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago  
this was the third one of '97 , following the very lackluster "" the saint , "" which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe ; and the surprisingly fun "" the peacemaker , "" featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain  
 "" the jackal "" tries to mix both elements  
and you thought "" the saint "" was bad  
 "" the jackal "" is loosely ( very loosely , i hope ) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i've yet to see , "" the day of the jackal , "" which featured ( apparently ) a suave hitman called the jackal , played by edward fox , trying to assasinate charles degaule  
well , welcome to the 90s , where a sorta suave hitman , also called the jackal ( bruce willis ) , trying to kill the head of the fbi    or 
is he ? 
after being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes ) , the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere , from helsinki to virginia , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he'll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion  
and like the saint , the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people  
the agent working on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier - yes , that sidney poitier ) , working with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( diane venora - lady capulet from "" romeo + juliet "" ) , gives up early on and meets with an ex-ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of '97 ) who's in a massachusetts jail , but who has apparently seen the jackal , who has been eluding the law forever  
soon , he's out working with the two untrusting agents , and trying to help them catch him  
there are numerous problems with the film , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on  
the film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller , but save a couple moments , the film never achieves suspense , or even a sense of intrigue  
sure , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense , but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register  
the film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience , or even an entertaining one  
it doesn't help that the plot is designed to be complex , but falls into so many problems , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances  
the script of "" the jackal "" is a complete mess , mostly because it can't decide what it wants to focus on  
is this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer ? 
is it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who's in everything for the money ? 
or is it a combination of both ? 
 "" the jackal "" aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character  
the connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast  
the worst part is the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then  
the supporting characters are worse  
sidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable  
what is poitier doing here ? 
he's one of the best living actors ! 
does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ? 
diane venora's russian character is almost as bad , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and a plastered on expressionless facade  
it's not that anyone's bad here ; it's that they have nothing to do  
the plot is a joke , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post-production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time  
the jackal himself is not even much of an international villain  
there are several times where he's in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself , the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill  
take a scene where he's being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color , and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it  
doesn't killing someone attract more attention than it does distract ? 
and does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place ? 
geez ! 
is there anything good here ? 
well    a 
couple things  
i did like willis's icy expressions ; he may not have been real suave or anything , but some of his looks are worth a chuckle  
richard gere has a couple of good moments , making his character as likable as he possibly could have  
and a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous , completely inane but fun kinda way , most notably : a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder ( jack black ) ; and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man , which has its share of a couple good jokes , most particular a kiss by willis "

-1,"over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind's nuclear testing  
partly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo  
a year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr  
as godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world  
thirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985  
now it's 14 years after toho's remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run  
in emmerich's godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr  niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation-induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms  
when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states  
meanwhile , tatopoulos's college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big-time news reporter  
she'd like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break  
of course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor "" animal "" palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey's trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place  
together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla  
with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation's premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla  
he didn't  
right up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history  
the plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur-like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it's up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down  
the script , however , is painfully bad  
it's fraught with lines so corny , they don't even belong in b-movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , "" you idiot , "" or "" you stupid girl  "" 
i suppose when you've got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well  
why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ? 
why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ? 
why do sidewinder missiles , which have small explosive warheads , blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla ? 
why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f-18 fighter-bombers , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ? 
okay , maybe the last one was a bit nit-picky , but hey , i was on a roll  
broderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he's weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way  
hank azaria does what he can , but don't expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage  
like broderick's , azaria's character is quite simply lacking in color  
what really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting  
casting must have been asleep on this one  
the one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we've seem him do in the past  
although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable  
unfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities  
the entire feel of the movie is tongue-in-cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it  
this results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess  
most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously  
although emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ? 
if we can't take the characters seriously , the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don't care what happens to them  
godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light-hearted than it should be  
far be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters , but here's a behemoth running through the city ! 
there's bound to be a lot of casualties , but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after-school g  i  
joe cartoon syndrome , where almost everyone seems to get out of harm's way just in time  
in a couple of scenes , godzilla briefly breathes fire  
none of the characters even remark upon this ability , nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers "

-1,"midway through "" anaconda "" , documentary filmmaker terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) turns to a co-worker and says "" i thought this movie would be my first big break  
instead , it's turned into a disaster  "" 
truer words have never been spoken  
 "" anaconda "" is a monster movie with a lousy monster  
it's a suspense film that is utterly predictable  
it's a mess the film does manage to drum up some scares , but only in the most elementary way , like a jack-in-the-box  
as you turn the crank , you're totally aware that the damn clown is going to pop up , but somehow it's still mildly startling when it happens  
the main difference between the giant snake in "" anaconda "" and the clown in a jack-in-the-box is that the clown is more realistic  
 "" anaconda "" boasts some of the worst special effects to appear onscreen in years  
animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe- inducing robots you've endured at disney world  
but it's the computer animated scenes that truly expand the meaning of the word lame  
in one shot , a character tries to flee from the monster by diving from a tree near a waterfall , but the giant snake springs out and loops around its hapless victim in mid air  
the scene , if done well , would have been a jaw- dropper  
here , the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than a saturday morning cartoon  
what's really amazing is that the filmmaker's were so proud of this dreadful shot that they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movie  
but enough about the phony snakes  
now it's time to talk about the lousy story  
heroic and very pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads a documentary film crew down a brazilian river in search of the shirishama indians , a legendary tribe that supposedly lives in the boondocks of the rain forest  
stoltz tells his crew "" pray that you didn't forget your bug spray  "" 
apparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff , because they spend most of the film wearing skimpy tops and short shorts with no ill effect  
along the way , the group rescues a whacked-out lapsed priest ( jon voight ) who claims to know how to find the shirishama  
within minutes , they throw away all their plans and follow voight down a tributary into the land of creepiness  
from that point on , the film is a hodgepodge of scenes and shots ripped off from "" jaws "" and "" dead calm  "" 
one of the oddest structural points of the film is the handling of eric stoltz  
early in the story , his character gets knocked into a coma by a river insect and spends virtually the rest of the movie unconscious  
so why did they hire an actor of the caliber of stoltz for what amounts to a cameo appearance ? 
also , why did stoltz , who generally selects his roles with great care , agree to appear in this crap ? 
ah , the mysteries of hollywood  
the remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to happen  
jonathan hyde is mildly diverting as a pompous englishman hired to narrate the documentary , but lopez and ice cube manage to rise above their cardboard characters  
lopez , who starred in "" selena , "" is an enormously appealing performer , possessing a vibrancy that makes even the most trite lines seem credible  
ice cube has a special charisma ; an ability to look like a macho adult and a frightened boy simultaneously  
there's also a special twinkle in his eyes , as if he's gently mocking his own tough-guy posturing  
but the movie really centers around the outrageously hammy performance of jon voight  
obsessed with capturing one of the giant anacondas , voight plays the villain in thick accent , with a series of leers and hisses , spouting the kind of dialogue usually heard only in episodes of "" jonny quest  "" 
at one point , he looms over the crew and says "" the anaconda is the perfect killing machine  
it strikes , wraps around you , holds you tighter than your true love  
and you get the privilege of hearing your bones break before the power of its embrace causes your veins to explode  
 "" that moment is so high-camp that it almost made the film tolerable  
almost  
fans of the horror genre may be tempted to check out "" anaconda "

-1,"the original _babe_ was my favorite movie of 1995 , a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience  
being a surprise commercial and critical success , it had no marketing tie-ins , which limited its final take  
thus , babe 2 arrives , with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1  
plush dolls , vending machines hawking t-shirts , and macy's thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday money-grubbing  
too late  
this is a sad review to write , because babe 2 not only does _not_ live up to the original , but it doesn't even come to a fraction of it  
i shouldn't expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors' magic , but this film tries too hard , and loses its charm  
consider a driver applying the accelerator with great intensity , unaware that his car is in neutral  
imagine with me , if you will , _scream_'s jamie kennedy , explaining the "" rules "" for sequels like babe 2  
 ( 1 ) there must be _more_ talking animals  
 ( 2 ) there must be _more_ slapstick comedy  
 ( 3 ) there must be _more_ songs for those mice to sing : that's cute  
 ( 4 ) keep the story cards to break up the action : that's cute too , even though "" the pig gets wise "" made no sense , given the context of that story partition  
 ( 5 ) there must be action , however illogical , that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original : the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to , the baa-ram-ewe secret code , the "" that'll do , pig  
that'll do  "" 
now throw in the limitations : ( a ) james cromwell , now a hot commodity , has limited time on the set ( or maybe he didn't approve of the script )  
 ( b ) christine cavanaugh , the voice of the original babe , demands more money ( $200 , 000--paltry considering the $80 million budget )  
out  
e  g  
daily comes in with noticable results  
 ( c ) george miller , the director , is more well-known for his dark futuristic mad max films and his twilight zone segment , not for kiddie fare ( and no , he didn't direct that _andre_ film in '94 )  
 ( d ) the special effects are impressive , _but limited_  
babe talks , but most of the time from a single shot , repeated over and over again  
 ( babe is center screen , looking straight into the camera , with a happy smirk--regardless of whether he's happy , or scared , or tired )  
season now with the "" original "" elements , which , as we will find out , are straight from the screenwriting-is-hell bin  
 ( i ) change the venue into "" the big city ""  
this has been praised as wildly original  
excuse me : didn't _home alone_ do this several years ago ? 
how about the muppets ? 
even _the bad news bears_ travelled to tokyo  
sorry  
no dice  
side note : to give the city a fairy-tale look , george miller crafted a fantastical fantasyland that merges the landmarks of the world's great cities , and yes , it _is_ impressive  
but this too is over-used , repeating the same view over and again on multiple occasions  
and , for the most part , babe _remains in the hotel_  
 ( ii ) given the limitations of cromwell , the human element is taken over by "" the boss' wife "" played by magda szubanski  
s-t-r-e-t-c-h  
she's not a lead actress-type , she's not funny enough in her physical comedy , and she's simply embarrassing in some of her pratfalls  
 ( have her arrested falsely on drug charges ! 
have her accidentally incite a riot with biker dudes and scantily clad babes ! 
have her bounce around on a bungee cord at a prestigious benefit dinner ! ) 
i was hoping for a little smirk during these scenes , but i felt sorry for the embarrassment that she put herself in  
i am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film , the violence , the scene where a pit bull dangles from the bridge , head submerged underwater "

-1," "" marie couldn't talk , "" paulie , the parrot star of his own movie , tells us about the daughter in his original family  
 "" dad couldn't listen  
and mom couldn't cope , so they got rid of me  "" 
paulie , the autobiography of a talking , not merely a mimicking , parrot , has jay mohr in the lead role of the bird - the voice , not the body - and as the minor character of benny , a small-time crook who uses paulie to pull off small scams like stealing twenties from atms  
as the parrot , mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut up  
benny , on the other hand , is a character you've seen a thousand times before , and mohr brings nothing new to that role  
roberts's deliberately slow pacing of laurie craig's script lends a subtle sweetness to its humor but creates some definite problems  
when a kids' movie wants to mosey along , watch out  
if the material is not crisp and perfectly composed , beauty can sometimes dissolve into tedium  
so it is with paulie  
when they let their bird do his stand-up comedy routines , the show hums and the audience roars  
too often , however , a sleepy silence ensues among the viewers as they wait for the story to pickup again  
tony shalhoub , the smart-mouthed chef from big night , plays misha , a recent russian immigrant to the u  s  he had been a teacher of literature at home , but now he makes his living as a janitor in the animal research lab to which paulie has been taken for study  
although misha gets a few nice lines ( "" i'm russian  
i like long stories  "" ) , 
his somber part seems designed only to elicit our sympathy  
besides paulie , the only character worth noting - other than 2 cute small parts played by cheech marin and gina rowlands - is the speech-impaired marie , played in a precious performance by cinematic newcomer , 5-year-old hallie kate eisenberg  
naturally enchanting , she gives the picture genuine heart  
the bad news is that her part is confined to the first half  
the best scenes have the bird dancing and strutting to show off his comedic skills  
when marie's family gets a cat , for example , the bird , who hasn't wanted to learn how to fly until then , takes an instant interest in soaring  
tricking the cat while insulting him at the same time , paulie calls him a stupid hairball  
their rapid physical antics add to the humor of the situation  
it's good quality sitcom material but performed by animals  
when one of the humans without much of a voice begins to sing , paulie cringes  
 "" i'm a bird , "" he explains with his frequently subtle humor  
 "" i have a small brain , and it's about to explode  "" 
the movie contains rich doses of john debney's dreamy music  
with heavy use of a solo violin , he keeps reinforcing the film's heart-warming themes  
and when paulie finally takes off in flight , the orchestra comes up loud and strong with cymbals clashing  
 "" it's a long story , "" says paulie  
 "" it's the only kind he knows , "" reflects misha  
and the motion picture , which runs the standard length for a kids' movie , still feels too long  
the best parts are enthralling , but then there are all of those dead spots in-between  
paulie is a movie that never quite lives up to its promise but manages to charm nevertheless  
paulie runs 1 : 32  
it is raged pg for a few mild profanities and would be fine for all ages "

-1,"warner brothers ; rated pg-13 ( mild violence , sexual situations ) ; 132 minutes 
director : luis mandoki 
screenplay : gerald di pego ( from the novel by nicholas sparks ) 
cast : kevin costner , robin wright-penn , paul newman , illeana douglas , robbie coltrane , jesse james , john savage  
review by : geoff berkshire 
i'm not an overly cynical guy  
there have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years  
however , i have my limits and i also have standards  
this brings us to the subject at hand : message in a bottle , the big ticket romance that warner brothers' unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentine's day  
the story , what little of it that there is , involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne ( robin wright-penn ) dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason ( jesse james )  
during a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean  
the letter , written to a mystery woman named catherine , instantly captivates her  
upon her return , theresa shares it with her best friend lina ( illeana douglas ) , her boss charlie ( robbie coltrane ) , and the entire city of chicago ( the newspaper publishes an article about it )  
it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake ( kevin costner ) and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down  
he turns out to have a colorful father ( paul newman ) but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing  
this is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship  
of course she doesn't tell him that she found his letter , she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later ( preferably right after they first make love )  
this way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened  
the discovery of the message and garret's discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film  
there's a truly lame subplot about garret's relationship with his dead wife's family ( he gets into a bar fight with her brother , played by john savage ) and then the necessary tear-jerking ending  
a fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die , although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel  
the actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced , and unintentionally humorous , sequences filmed since    
well , since costner's the postman ( 1997 )  
message in a bottle is one slow moving film  
last year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe black but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this  
they also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work  
message in a bottle has a decent enough cast but they're fighting the material all the way , and losing badly  
costner and , especially , wright-penn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring  
they also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry  
the supporting players are given very little to do  
the reliable douglas is particularly wasted  
old pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film  
a confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played  
however , too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are  
the film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works to undercut the story  
gabriel yared , who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient ( 1996 ) and city of angels ( 1998 ) with his scores , overdoes it a bit here  
caleb deschanel's camera makes everything look a little too beautiful  
do the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly ? 
the editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times  
the real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego  
working from a best- selling novel by nicholas sparks ( which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county ) , di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times  
its strict adherence to clich ? s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer ( 1998 ) "

with the millenium just around the corner , hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century  
this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil  
the result is somewhat predictable  
i didn't have high hopes about arnold's "" much anticipated "" return to the big screen  
schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased , action lovers won't be bored , and the catholic league will be angry  
everyone else will see 'end of days' for what it is : a deliciously bad motion picture  
think of it as hollywood's own y2k bug  
did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you'll get 999 , as in 1999 ? 
yes , you better believe it   satan is here on earth , working on his latest project -- the end of days  
this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and , although not al pacino , he is fun to behold  
he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker , wreaking , as they say , havoc  
the way it works is he smirks and something explodes  
before the stroke of the new millennium he's got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations  
only schwarzenegger's cop attached to an anti-terrorist unit can stop him  
films like this has one serious weakness -- logic  
no matter how you twist the "" plot "" , you'll find it incredibly stupid ( even for a schwartzenegger movie ! )  
the incredible fact is that such directors never learn  
after thousands of headless productions , this theme has become one big clich ?  
here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution  
he is walking around n  y  , blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius  
all he wants is the girl , that is somehow special  
but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks , he has hidden her in a church , where satan dare not enter  
so the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information : "" you can have your wife and daughter back   i 
can give you happiness that you can only dream of   just 
give me the address   "" 
indeed with a script like that , you could make a wonderful parody , but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously , attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller  
and for you who have awaited arnold swartzenegger's comeback , will not be very satisfied  
we've not seen him in a while  
that's because he didn't have a worthy opponent  
he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars  
he has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop "

i can't help but feel like everyone is looking at me  
it's as if all the audience is gazing at the back of my head in the darkness , eyes shooting daggers , quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hard-earned money to spend their time watching this    
this    
thing  
i shift uncomfortably in my seat  
i'm reminded of how i feel when i see a pair of second- or third-rate celebrities engaging in a teleprompted "" funny "" conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award  
it's not my fault , i know it's not my fault , but dammit , someone's gotta be embarrassed , because it doesn't look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame  
i'm about to give you a list of names of people who are gonna make a movie together : garry shandling , annette bening , john goodman , greg kinnear , mike nichols  
do any of these names make you instantly shudder ? 
the answer i would have come up with before today is no , this is quite a list of talented individuals we've got here  
granted , john goodman was in the flintstones , and greg kinnear has turned in some less-than-lackluster leading man performances in certified failures like a smile like yours , but even so , they've got proven power as excellent supporting players  
garry shandling has two television classics under his belt , his ingenious little it's garry shandling's show and the larry sanders show  
and for god's sake , mike nichols directed the graduate , and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty  
so explain this    
this    
thing  
what planet are you from ? 
purports to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole pop-psychology mars/venus phenomenon  
but what this movie winds up being is a collection of unfunny cringe-inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe-inducing moments ; the end result is , unsurprisingly , an unfunny , uninsightful , cringe-inducing , thoroughly icky embarrassment  
garry shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males ( they reproduce through cloning , of course )  
his leaders put a select group of males through a series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth , find a female of the species , and impregnate her  
they're taught how to pretend that they're listening by nodding and saying "" uh-huh , "" and how to compliment shoes  
imagine my delighted surprise when , oh heavens , all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably , producing comedic results ! 
the lucky winner is fitted with a penis ( since theirs , after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence    
i will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that they're all just clones    
whoops , too late  ) 
the penis , when aroused , tends to make a humming noise  
the writers , when frequently strapped for ideas , tend to turn to this as a source of "" comedy  ""

-1,"the swirling sick feeling hit me just a few minutes into "" heartbreakers  "" 
ray liotta's character was making out with his secretary when his new wife knocked on the door of his office  
while scrambling to collect himself , he frantically shouted to her , "" just wait a sex ? er , i mean sec ! "" 
i was struck by a wave of revulsion , thinking , "" geez , didn't lines like that die when 'three's company' was canceled ? "" 
over the next few minutes , as the barely double entendres and lingering cleavage shots grew more numerous , i realized that the mindset behind "" heartbreakers "" predated "" three's company  "" 
suddenly , i had an out-of-body experience as my internal way-back machine swept me to the mid-1960s  
all across america , the counter-culture was growing like wildfire , but there was scant evidence of it on tv  
while young people were challenging traditional values on the streets , frustrated teenagers like me were stuck at home , sulking while our parents enjoyed the latest bob hope special  
women in skimpy bathing suits would prance onscreen while hope made growling noises and leered at their breasts  
on another channel , dean martin made wisecracks about "" booze and broads "" and peter lawford , decked out in love beads and a nehru jacket , purred suggestive one-liners as he ogled the go-go dancers  
the adults laughed and laughed  
 "" heartbreakers "" reeks of that stagnant mentality , from its lingering shots of jennifer love hewitt's vah-vah-voom breasts to its leaden screenplay , which paints women as haughty schemers and men as drooling buffoons too sex-obsessed to realize they are being manipulated  
in addition to liotta and hewitt , the cast includes sigourney weaver , gene hackman , jason lee , nora dunn and anne bancroft  
i can't imagine what drew performers of their caliber to this project  
perhaps they thought it was a parody of the sniggering sex comedies of the '60s  
if so , they were sadly mistaken  
the story revolves around a mother-daughter con-team  
it opens with the marriage of max ( weaver ) to dean ( liotta ) , a new jersey chop shop operator  
having withheld sex until the honeymoon , max pretends to pass out on their wedding night  
the next morning , she feigns illness , sending a very horny dean off to the office , where he ends up in the arms of his new secretary  
just as the two are about to get overtly physical , max bursts into the room and catches them  
the "" horrified "" bride dissolves the union , garnering a healthy cash settlement along the way  
of course , the secretary was really her daughter page ( hewitt ) and the whole thing was a set-up  
the women move on , but an irs agent ( bancroft ) catches up with them and demands a huge amount of money to cover unpaid taxes  
in desperate need of funds , max and page head for palm beach to replay the scam  
their mark this time is william b  tensy ( hackman , in hideous make-up ) , a decrepit tobacco tycoon obsessed with the joys of smoking  
max starts to put the game into action , but page is so repelled by the old man ( and angry with her mom ) that she slips off to enact her own score , targeting jack , a laid back young beach bar owner who is worth a fortune  
complications arise when page realizes that good-natured jack is stirring actual emotions in her steely little heart  
as if that wasn't enough , dean reappears on the scene with revenge on his mind  
the attempt to weld a romance onto a caper comedy served only to remind me of the infinitely superior "" a fish called wanda  "" 
i won't bother to compare the two  
suffice to say that everything done right in "" wanda "" is done wrong here  
 "" heartbreakers "" is soulless , inept and , at 123 minutes , at least a half-hour too long  
sigourney weaver and jennifer love hewitt throw themselves into their parts , but have nowhere to go with the metallic characters  
gene hackman is utterly wasted in a one-note , one-joke part that has him doing nothing but smoking , coughing and waxing rhapsodic about smoking and sex  
poor jason lee is stuck in the ingenue role and the normally charismatic actor comes off as merely bland  
ray liotta manages to squeeze a tiny bit of humanity and humor into his walking clich ? , but only a bit  
the low point in the film has weaver employing a russian accent bad enough to make boris and natasha wince , while doing half-assed slapstick with a broken off penis from a statue  
bear in mind , though , that this is merely the worst segment of a movie made up of nothing but low points  
if you remember bob hope specials with fondness , this might be your cup of tea "

charlotte bennett ) , laurene landon ( velda ) , alan king ( charles kalecki ) , geoffrey lewis ( joe butler ) , paul sorvino ( detective pat chambers ) , judson scott ( charles hendricks ) , barry snider ( romero ) , julia barr ( norma childs ) / mpaa rating : r / review : 
in the 1982 updating of mickey spillane's 1947 novel "" i , the jury , "" hard-boiled detective mike hammer is a vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze trans am , dresses like don johnson in "" miami vice "" with less pastels , and has sworn off alcohol  
however , he still smokes his lucky strikes , detests all forms of authority , and kills at a whim  
beyond that , the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy page-turner by spillane , probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writers  
the movie starts off with a bang : a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series , complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti ( "" rocky "" )  
after that , the movie and the book begin the same , with the murder of jack williams ( frederick downs ) , a one-armed detective and hammer's best friend  
hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack's death , and with the help of his devoted secretary , the blond and shapely velda ( laurene landon ) , and the alternately friendly / antagonistic police chief pat chambers ( paul sorvino ) , he is immediately on the killer's trail  
here the movie splits completely from the book , and dives into a convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia , the cia , one of hammer's vietnam vet buddies , and a kinky sex clinic  
many of the same characters from the book appear in the movie , but they take on slightly different roles  
for instance , charles kalecki ( alan king ) , a numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book , turns into a suave mob boss  
and , more importantly , hammer's suspicious love interest , charlotte bennett ( barbara carrera ) , morphs from a run-of-the-mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic  
 "" i , the jury "" is one of several cinematic renditions of spillane's books ( including a 1953 version which was made in 3-d ) , but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way : it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood's production code  
although this takes the 1982 version of "" i , the jury "" closer to the core of the original subject matter , it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism , because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book  
rest assured , the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity , but it is thoroughly violent , especially toward women  
it features one woman having her neck slashed , a set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia ( judson scott ) , and another woman shot point-blank in the belly by hammer himself  
no one would deny that spillane's writing has a definite misogynistic nature , but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment ; its constant equation of sex and violence , much of which is played with the intention of being erotic , is quite unsettling  
it's no surprise that the movie , like the book , fades to black with a dead woman on the floor  
 "" i , the jury "" had a troubled production and was not well-supported by the studio that made it , which is one explanation why it didn't do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made  
the script was written by larry cohen , who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies , like "" it's alive "" ( 1974 ) and its two sequels , "" q "" ( 1981 ) , and "" the stuff "" ( 1985 )  
cohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well , but he was yanked from the director's chair after only a week's worth of shooting because he was already $100 , 000 over budget  
he was quickly replaced by richard t  heffron , who has worked for the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects  
heffron was obviously brought in not for his talent , but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently  
it shows in the final product  
cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer , but heffron has none  
he shot the movie quickly and clumsily , and although some scenes ring true , most of them are flat , trite , and invariably dull  
the movie features numerous car chases , shoot-outs , and stunts , but heffron's background in television is the dominant tone ; despite the graphic violence and full-frontal nudity , "" i , the jury , "" takes on the air of a made-for-tv quickie , with no real punch or depth  
but the problems in "" i , the jury "" run deeper than the technical  
the central fault in this updating is mike hammer , whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties  
because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person , hammer's character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona  
we never really get that impression in the movie -- there is no first-person voice-over narration and some scenes don't have hammer in them at all  
consequently , a great deal of the texture of spillane's storytelling is lost  
the period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer's moral code is thrown to the wind  
despite his characterization as a hard-nosed , violent , misogynistic killer , hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code  
the title itself , "" i , the jury , "" refers to his anti-establishment notion of being his own law  
unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police , hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment  
in this way , he can be seen as "" above the law , "" but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct , his own morality  
the movie forgoes that aspect of his character , and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society's terms , but in any terms , especially his own  
if anything , hammer always had his professionalism , but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful "
-1,"john boorman's "" zardoz "" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own  
not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d  wood jr  has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time  
of course , wood's career can be explained by two things : he had no money and he had no talent  
boorman , on the other hand , cannot court such excuses to explain "" zardoz "" ( or his follow-up film , the equally awful "" exorcist ii : the heretic "" )  
boorman obviously had a sizable budget , a matinee idol movie star ( sean connery ) in the lead role , and although you wouldn't know it from this film , boorman does indeed have talent  
this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece "" deliverance "" ( 1972 ) , as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama "" hope and glory "" ( 1987 ) , the slightly over-conceived arthurian epic "" excalibur "" ( 1981 ) and the father-son jungle adventure "" the emerald forest "" ( 1985 )  
his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination , but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste  
if boorman is anything , he's ambitious , and when he succeeds , it's in grand fashion  
unfortunately , the bigger they are , the harder they fall , and when boorman falls , the resounding impact can be heard for miles around  
 "" zardoz "" is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies , an obsession of boorman's  
his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even "" the wizard of oz , "" a book which figures into the movie's plot  
but , despite all this reaching , the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling  
the events take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is little of the typical futuristic movie-ness to be found  
in fact , things seems to have moved backwards , with people riding horses , shooting old-style guns , and living in large victorian mansions  
it's more middle ages than space age  
the world of "" zardoz "" is divided into two distinct hemispheres : the outlands , where all the poor , pathetic people live , and the vortex , where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life  
these immortals never grow old , they never engage in sexual activity , they possess psychological powers , and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian marxist society where everyone is equal , and everyone contributes equally to the society  
however , if one breaks the rules , that person is punished by being aged so many years  
if someone breaks the rules enough , he or she is aged to the point of senility , and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals  
one of the immortals , arthur frayn ( niall buggy ) , a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face , is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed  
like "" the wizard of oz , "" he adopts a god-like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head  
 ( this flying head is one of the movie's opening images , and it's a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come  ) 
calling himself zardoz , frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators , whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can't procreate and take up more resources  
from inside his giant , stone head , zardoz bellows seriously laugh-inducting statements like , "" the gun is good  
the penis is evil  "" 
that line alone is worth the movie's cult following  
one day , an exterminator named zed ( sean connery ) , sneaks into zardoz's flying stone , pushes frayn out , and goes back to the vortex  
once there , the immortals label him a "" brutal "" and study him like a lab rat , taking great , perverse care in exploring his sexuality , which is a mystery to them  
they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection , and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily-clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up  
i say "" hilarious "" because that is exactly what "" zardoz "" is  
it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he didn't get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming  
just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back , a wyatt earp-style handlebar mustache , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker  
boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of "" deliverance , "" which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green-light this effort  
he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera , including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( "" 2001 "" ) , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in "" zardoz "" besides the inadvertent humor  
sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 , and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace  
he got exactly that in "" zardoz , "" and it's a wonder it didn't end his career  
i'm sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements "
-1,"i don't expect much from eddie murphy these days  
for the past four years , the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another  
such films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures  
the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps  
the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places  
sherman has just invented a new "" youth drink "" that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time  
janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons )  
with love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers  
with some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the "" buddy love "" link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker  
but one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated    
because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy  
then the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes  
and did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ? 
the movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene  
pure and simple , the klumps is a failure  
its script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes  
any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process  
it's more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash  
hey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes  
the characterization of sherman's family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema  
everyone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough  
the grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts  
the father is gruff , is fired from a blue-collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings  
the mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone  
the brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood  
sherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to  
but the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy  
the family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct  
and you got the feeling that these crass people couldn't act like this all the time  
the sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic  
after a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story  
its also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line  
even the best effects can't seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days  
now that i think about it , the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make  
people will be lined up around the block for it  
the studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002  
eddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he'll play every character in the movie  
i just can't wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself "

-1,"there should be a requirement that a potential viewer be under a certain film iq in order to see "" mission to mars  "" 
there are probably quite a few people who are going to enjoy it , and most of them will probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind  
but there are those who will not , and those will most likely be people who have already seen one or more of the following movies : "" 2001 : a space odyssey , "" "" armageddon , "" "" apollo 13 , "" "" the abyss , "" "" close encounters of the third kind , "" "" e  t  
the extra-terrestrial , "" "" alien , "" and "" aliens  "" 
why ? 
because there is not one original idea in "" mission to mars  "" 
all of it is cribbed from other films ( and in most cases , better films )  
if this is the sort of thing you don't mind , you might like the film  
of course , there are other reasons not to like "" mission to mars , "" the main one being a script written by people who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who haven't used their brains in some time , and who don't intend to start during the film's running time  
 "" mission to mars "" manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time  
the plot , cribbed greatly from "" 2001 , "" concerns a team sent to mars , the first manned trip ever made to the red planet  
luke graham ( don cheadle ) leads the team , jointly formed of americans and russians  
the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse ( this being nothing like the pulse-emitting monolith in "" 2001 "" -- that one was on the * moon * ) , but when they try to study it , a giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them ( all except luke , who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station , which looks strangely like the rotating space station in "" 2001 "" )  
a rescue mission is planned with husband & wife team woody blake ( tim robbins ) and terri fisher ( connie nielsen ) , obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , and extra crew member phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) along for the ride  
after some zero-gravity dancing , they run into problems when one of their engines is blown , forcing them to attempt a desperate landing aboard a supply vessel  
now stranded on mars with minimal supplies , the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home  
after all , that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth  
 "" mission to mars "" is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it , so let's start with one of the things that does work : director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film  
that's it  
everything else fails  
the failure isn't de palma's fault ; he's working from an atrocious script  
only during the sequence aboard the ship ( looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in "" 2001 "" ) where the rescue team's air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does "" mission to mars "" come to life  
a scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension , until you realize that the entire danger/more danger/attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film ; it's just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes  
take it out , and the plot isn't affected in any way  
the sequence also suffers from a few plot holes ( as does the rest of the film ) : why is the ship's computer ( which sounds strangely like hal from , uh , "" 2001 "" ) able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine ? 
why did tim robbins' character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside ? 
shouldn't the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach ? 
why are the characters such idiots ? 
because the script makes little attempt to properly develop them  
all the "" conflict "" is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene ( which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot ) during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know : "" jim , it's too bad you can't go on this mission because you were determined 'psychologically inadequate' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together "" -- does anyone really talk like this ? 
can't we find out these things in a less grating matter , like maybe in a flashback ? 
the whole film is like that  
the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what's going on ; they must * tell * us exactly what we're looking at * every * time  
sample dialogue from the film : ( shot of mars ) astronaut a : "" look , there's mars "" astronaut b : "" you sure that's mars ? "" 
astronaut a : "" yeah , that's mars all right  "" 
astronaut c : "" hey , are you guys looking at mars ? "" 
that exchange isn't actually in "" mission to mars , "" but i wouldn't be surprised if it were  
for all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film haven't learned to do something all those directors did very well : show and don't tell  
de palma used to know how , but seems to have forgotten  
this is mentally-challenged filmmaking ; they assume the audience won't get what's going on , so they explain everything five times over  
fourth-graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted  
the principal actors sleepwalk their way through "" mission to mars , "" never managing to do away with an apparent "" i'm just here to get a paycheck "" attitude  
cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines  
armin mueller-stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo  
robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard "" decent guy "" performance  
and sinise hams it up with "" wistful "" facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy-handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen-from-no-less-than-three-movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them ) conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub-par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then  
and of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in "" 2001 "" who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world "
-1,"not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie  
earlier this year , nora ephron wrote and produced one of the year's least likeable "" comedies "" called hanging up , featuring a bunch of annoying women ( ironically , lisa kudrow played one in that film as well ) who barely have time to care about anyone but themselves  
ick    real 
sweet stuff  
but her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier this summer , with a film entitled battlefield earth  
i seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film , even if it was on a "" cheese "" factor , as everybody , and i mean everybody else , pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time  
yipes    another 
beauty  
so what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with a movie co-starring the ever-versatile lisa kudrow ? 
uhhhm , you guessed it    not 
much  
plot : in order to escape major financial difficulties , a local weatherman hooks up with his ball-picking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery  
but as more and more people find out about their scheme , more and more people demand a part of their winnings , and more and more problems arise  
critique : simply stated , i didn't laugh once during this entire picture  
for a comedy , it offered me a few smiles , a bunch of nincompoops as characters , a miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow , in what can only described as a "" sluttier "" version of her character of phoebe on tv's "" friends ""  
this film was not as disastrous as i thought it would be , but it was pretty close  
thankfully , the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits , dancing as the weatherman were left in the film's trailer , and not in this final cut  
and not unlike the worst movie of the year so far , beautiful , this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic , idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast  
foremost was travolta's character , who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie  
and for me , the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong  
he didn't fit the part  
i just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role  
a cool , calculating roughneck with a certain hip , suave "" je ne sais quoi ""  
in this film , he looks like he's trying to be funny , trying to be bad , trying to be good  
we're not supposed to be able to notice that , and when we do , at least in my case , i consider it a wrong choice in casting  
add that to lisa kudrow , boring us with yet another one of her patented "" dumb blonde "" routines , but this time , dressed in sexier outfits  
michael rapaport , stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isn't quite up at the same speed level as everyone else  
and a truckload of empty comedic bullet shells , and you've got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize  
the only real good thing that i could say about this film is that its story was actually half-interesting and never really bored me  
i also liked michael moore's perverted cousin character , and i loved , and i say it again , loved the character that bill pullman played  
give this dude his own movie ! 
he played a lazy cop , a man who tries everything not to do any real work  
he fakes injuries to get off duty , tries to avoid arrest situations so that he won't have to fill out any forms   "
-1,"it's been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci-fi opus `mission to mars' , and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar  
why ? 
the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy , stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera , instead shooting for the angle of a feel-good science fiction drama more akin to `2001 : a space odyssey'  
i got the feeling that most of my fellow movie-going patrons were expecting another `armageddon'  
but no , `mission to mars' certainly isn't one large action sequence about colossal disaster  
this is a supposedly thoughtful , family-friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel  
you have been warned  
of course , crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible ( see `apollo 13' for an excellent example ) , but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation  
brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off  
when he gets his hands on an intelligent , systematically practical script like `the untouchables' or `mission : impossible' , the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement ( although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally )  
of course , there's also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name ( including `snake eyes' and the notorious bomb `the bonfire of the vanities' )     
all of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood  
that term may be too harsh , but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is `mission to mars' , my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient  
if i were gary sinise , i wouldn't touch de palma with a 10-foot pole  
sinise is a wonderful , wonderful actor , but after appearing in `snake eyes' and this vomit-inducing sham , i'm sure he wouldn't want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration  
the academy award-winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell , a man who recently lost his wife ( kim delaney ) and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars ( oops , forgot to mention the year - 2020 )  
after a barbecue get-together for the astronauts , we cut to luc goddard ( don cheadle ) and his team , who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet  
suddenly , a towering formation of rocks and soil - probably best dubbed a `sand tornado' - appears and creates a whirlwind of suction  
for some reason , the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this , as if it were a lovely piece of art  
the team is killed within seconds , expect for luc , who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive  
immediately , a second mission - consisting of astronauts mcconnell , husband and wife woody and terri blake ( tim robbins and connie nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) - are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars  
let's put the `secret' on hold for now , and discuss the trip there  
it is explained , whether scientifically accurate or not ( probably not ) , that a trip to mars takes roughly six months  
i'm not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind `m2m' didn't capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia  
instead , we join the team during their final days aboard the ship  
what happened during the five months prior to this ? 
did they just play cards and tell dirty jokes ? 
still , there are few nicely tense moments ( maybe the only in the movie ) during the time-frame involving a fuel leak  
depalma's direction is quite good in these scenes , although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent ( organ music in space ? 
c'mon )  
there's a few good , imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese , a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud  
it's a colossal bummer that `mission to mars' is poorly assembled and laughably written , with a dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists  
as mentioned before , anyone looking for some disaster-movie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed    
maybe even cheated  
after the unbelievably hokey final shot ( with the words ? the end' somehow adding insult to injury ) , a few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen  
others muttered obscenities , shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling `jeez , that sucked  ' 
okay , it did suck  
but you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy "
-1,"new address  
same old attitude  
don't forget to recommend a film , read the journal , or send me some of that nasty hate mail  ) 
starring bruce willis , billy bob thornton , liv tyler , ben affleck written by jonathan hensleigh and j  j  
abrams directed by michael bay 
it rocks-actually , lots of rocks fly at us or from us , in slow or fast motion , at several points in the film  
they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward , and when they land-once in a while , when we need a break from the space sequences-they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like  
 ( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur  ) 
they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon , a steroid user's answer to deep impact  
bruce willis stars as harry stamper , a famed oil-driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond "" zero barrier "" and destroys our planet  
why an oil driller ? 
they require someone experienced with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid  
 ( in one unintentionally ( ? ) 
hilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller they built based on his own blueprints ; it is poorly constructed-harry criticizes almost every aspect of it  
we trust nasa to build space shuttles that can land on twirling asteroids ? ) 
harry assembles the obligatory "" ragtag "" bunch of "" cowboys "" , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck )  
once they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes  
whether or not they save the day , i will not reveal  
nor will you care  
i will say this : you know you're in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope  
willis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck  
their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material  
steve buscemi's character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic  
 "" rockhound "" , as he's called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film  
so why did they bring him up there to begin with ? 
rather , why write him into the film ? -give 
his almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig  
i'm guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue  
liv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father's band's ( "" aerosmith "" ) songs grace the soundtrack  
director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen  
 ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate's brain  ) 
whenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out "" we lost ( insert dead person's last name here ) ! "" 
i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one , and close-ups of the corpses' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood  
armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla  
it looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework  
it has a vivid soundmix  
but at almost two-and-a-half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story  
the love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic-fever  
bollocks ! 
the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler  
remember a little film called jaws ? 
in this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark  
they didn't much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another  
one of jaws' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories  
this is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we'll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end  
not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-i'd be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before "" action "" was called  
a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don't bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery "

-1,"in my review of "" the spy who shagged me , "" i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics : every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series , it is followed by a third movie that is a bore  
the cause is probably complacency ; a studio sighs with relief when part 2 lives up to expectations and figures part 3 is a sure thing  
 "" scream 3 "" provides the latest proof of this rule  
in los angeles production has begun on "" stab 3 : return to woodsboro , "" the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott ( neve campbell )  
however , life soon starts imitating art , and "" stab "" cast members turn up stabbed  
smelling yet another book deal , gale weathers ( courteney cox arquette ) comes to the set to investigate and finds her ex-boyfriend dewey riley ( david arquette ) acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer ( parker posey ) , the actress playing gale in "" stab 3  "" elsewhere , our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name  
  
  
until she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice  
the late randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) makes a surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of a trilogy  
he notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend with  
indeed , "" scream 3 "" tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all , the murder of sidney's mother maureen before the beginning of the original "" scream  "" 
at the scene of each murder in "" scream 3 , "" the killer leaves a photo of sidney's mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood and even includes a note claiming to be her real killer  
to find out who the killer is , our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureen's missing years when she was a starlet appearing in low-budget horror films  
 ( even with that little information , you can probably already guess what the killer's relationship to sidney is )  
unlike its predecessors , "" scream 3 "" doesn't have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer  
the characters we do suspect are all undeveloped , so that by the end we don't even care who the killer is  
the jaded detective ( patrick dempsey ) ? 
the kinky producer ( lance henriksen ) ? 
the driven young director ( scott foley ) ? 
the ingenue ( emily mortimer ) ? 
the character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random  
wes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret , so it's quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen  
the series' trademark references to other horror films have become trite and obvious  
possibly it's the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson , who penned the first two , or maybe it's that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche  
i groaned as an attack on sidney from the first "" scream "" was repeated moment-for-moment in the hollywood set of her home  
at some point , referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas  
 "" scream 3 "" also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and familiar faces in small roles  
look for jenny mccarthy , carrie fisher , patrick warburton ( puddy from "" seinfeld "" ) , roger corman , and jason mewes and kevin smith ( as jay and silent bob ) to walk through at some point  
all these bit players put forth more effort than the series' returning stars , who are probably saving their energy for the long post- "" scream "" job search  
another prediction i made in a previous review has come to pass : more movies are copying "" the blair witch project "" 's web strategy  
 "" scream 3 "" has three official websites that ( wink , wink ) pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie  
the sunrise studios site ( scream3  com ) has trailers for other sunrise releases as well as the "" latest 'stab 3' news  "" 
there's also a gail weathers official site ( galeweathers  com ) and a sunrise sucks site that has more "" stab "" scandals the studio wants to cover up ( sunrisesucks  com )  
craven and company promise that this is the last installment in the "" scream "" series  
while i hope that's true , i don't hold out much hope-horror movie series are even harder to kill than their monsters  
there's a "" halloween h2k "" in the works , even though michael myers was beheaded in "" h20 , "" and a "" freddy vs  jason "" has been talked about for awhile , despite the fact that both characters were "" killed off  "" 
there's bound to be a "" scream 4 "" someday , even if it starts over with a new set of movie-star wannabes "
-1,"welcome to your oh-so typical sequel  
it tries to be twice as big as it's predecessor , yet ends up twice as shallow  
shallow     hmm    now there's an idea  
maybe if the ill-fated cruise liner in this movie had struck a shallow reef early on things may have turned out better  
the first thing that struck me    and 
surprised me , was that the camera work ( for the opening sequence anyway ) was terrible  
looked like the cameramen were drunk and kept tripping on their own feet       very 
different to the original movie  
the characters ? 
well , not many of the characters actually * had * characters , but here's a rundown  
annie , who was the highlight of the the original , must have seriously banged her head in the train crash at the end of the first movie  
why ? 
because something's got to account for her losing that many iq points  
even though annie wasn't exactly a rocket scientist in speed , here some of her actions just make you want to beat your head against a wall  
for instance , after successfully using a chainsaw to cut a hole in a door so that a group of people can escape noxious gases - she stands in the middle of the opening for about five minutes till someone reminds her that the people can't get ut till she get's the chainsaw out of their faces     bang 
bang bang 
in point of fact sandra's character is turned into little more than one of those scantly dressed extras from hercules , who constantly has to be rescued  
jason patric ? 
all i can say is bring back keanu  
keanu reeves might have the emotional range of a tree stump    but 
that's one more tree stump than jason has  
i don't think he changed facial expressions all movie - jason , smile for the cameras ! ! 
now frown !   "
-1,"i cried during _babe_  
i admit it  
the special effects , the story , the great dialogue were woven together so delicately and successfully that my mind lost track that this was a "" children's film "" --so much so that , yes , i got a little overly sentimental  
such , my friend , is the power of cinema  
when word came out that they were using this newly developed f/x for a doctor dolittle update , in which eddie murphy plays the title character , and many great comic actors supply the voices , my anticipation rose to great expectations  
they can't possibly drop the ball on this one  
can't miss  
can't possibly miss  
they missed  
what went wrong ? 
after much thought , i supply three general rules  
 ( 1 ) don't let a television actress-turned-comedy movie director near an urbanite script ( i  e  , penny marshall's dreadful "" preacher's wife "" )  
betty thomas worked wonders with "" the brady bunch movie "" , but the same sitcom-airiness doesn't quite work here  
it's as if she lifted a generic sitcom , and iced it with light doses of modern r&b  
take away the black cast , take away the atrocious soundtrack , and you have the residue of some mid-80's kirk cameron show  
 ( 2 ) the greater the cast , the less the individual cast-member has to do ( i  e  , 
 "" con air "" )  
it is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman , garry schandling , john leguizimo , ellen degeneres , and gilbert godfried in your lineup , but they have nothing to do but improvise their underdeveloped , stereotyped characters , one-line-at-a-time  
it's even worse , because sometimes their voices are so unrecognizable that you don't get the satisfaction of linking the voice to the comedian until the credits  
now there are three character actors who do get special treatment : albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project he's in , and the scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certain poignancy  
norm mcdonald fares nearly as well , as a stray dog who learns to bond with dolittle  
but there's little humor here  
that rests on the shoulders of chris rock , sorely miscast and unfunny as the voice of their wise-ass guinea pig  
even the mouth is ill-synched  
 ( 3 ) don't let the special effects technicians walk away with the script  
there's a certain timing that's mandatory in comedy  
to have this timing usurped by the brilliancy of computer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim henson's creature shop , is a travesty  
this is not to say that special effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren't well-timed laughfests ; with the right director , they can be and have  
here , betty thomas is clearly over her head  
i wish i could commend the special effects , but they're merely average  
count the number of times where the animal's mouth is turned away from the camera , or too far to notice , or ill-synched  
this is less a "" babe "" and more of a "" look who's barking "" clone  
you may be wondering , 'how does eddie murphy fare ? ' 
well , he came back with the exceptional "" nutty professor "" , and i don't doubt he can come back again  
here , he's tied into a straight man and given little to do  
the exceptions are when he fears he's going crazy : a far cry from his smarter-than-you'd expect routine that he's more adept at  
it's unfortunate that he is where richard pryor was ten years ago , making lame comedies without the same bite he had given in his early years  
after all this , what's left ? 
butt jokes "

-1,"it seemed like the perfect concept  
what better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? 
it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh  
jim carrey's signed on too ? 
even better  
the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as "" schizophrenia , "" and so forth  
such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire , proving that some people just couldn't take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy  
yes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny  
it's not for lack of trying  
the farrellys utilize in "" me , myself & irene "" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them  
this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult  
soon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster  
this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted , or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street  
then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks  
some have suggested that this isn't a problem , because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work  
they're wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort , 1996's "" there's something about mary  "" 
 ( 1999's "" outside providence "" was technically an earlier project  ) 
the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected  
in "" mary , "" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion  
 "" me , myself & irene , "" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at "" mary "" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work  
having been produced by the same guys who made "" mary , "" "" irene "" seems like an even bigger disappointment  
the brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes  
but they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of "" me , myself & irene "" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy  
the plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p  waters ( renee zellweger ) , who's in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that's entirely predictable from the get-go  
 ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? 
yeah , me too  ) 
the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be  
compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it's no longer funny , merely gross  
the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry  
take , for example , the subplot involving charlie's three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon )  
the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face  
but by the end of the film , they're still doing the same schitck it hasn't been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn't been dropped either  
that's too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through  
 "" me , myself & irene "" reeks of wasted opportunities  
there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie's new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank's actions  
this doesn't really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie's condition early on , so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it  
the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , "" whitey "" ) , but the script doesn't go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax  
jim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he's left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in "" all of me  "" 
it's a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny  
carrey doesn't pull any stunts we don't expect him to pull , and the farrellys' script doesn't give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren't set up in any meaningful way  
perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better "
-1,
-1,"for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer , hard boiled , face off ) appears to have made an exciting , elegant , charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them  
sadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two-hour long episode of magyuver  
and not a particularly good one at that  
what went wrong ? 
mi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it'll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise's firing gun just so they can die really cool  
early on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic  
in one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other's eyes with come hither sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff  
prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another  
why ? 
i haven't the foggiest  
i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply  
with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects  
it's possible that these "" spies "" could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored  
the scenes i've described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character  
god forbid  
woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial-like visuals  
still in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish  
cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is )  
between the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact  
the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us  
sure it's all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product  
thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that's about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight  
they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres  
newton bats her eyes flirtatiously  
cruise grins a little too slyly  
the cruise character , ethan hunt , has been drastically altered since the first film  
here cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1  
he's cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90's )  
sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise's initial "" i'm the man ! "" 
charm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug  
mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won't stop  
the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could've been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the "" symbolic "" pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture )  
we've all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand  
it isn't done any differently here  
the action is pure hard target \ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind  
he's cool for sure but he's made to be as empty as the movie  
the actor isn't used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one  
when he's not beaming away , he's staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell , but woo's editing seriously undermines the effort  
he fetishizes cruise's angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof  
i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he's really austin powers  
in a classic woo action moment , ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death  
the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise , basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does ) "

-1,"`the bachelor' is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see  
wading through this gooey , detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic  
those hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris o'donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere ; `the bachelor' is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few brief moments of surprising poignancy  
awaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money  
although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty-boy cocoon , chris o'donnell has an effortless charm as an actor  
most will recognize him as the high-flying robin from the two latest `batman' films , but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile  
can o'donnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders ? 
perhaps , if he found the proper vehicle    
but `the bachelor' falls far short of the requirements  
the actor just can't register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success  
a few instances of adorable humor aside , it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is `the bachelor'  
o'donnell plays jimmie , a hopeless romantic in his late twenties who's progressing in a serious relationship with anne ( renee zellweger )  
jimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals , and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage  
the problem is that his proposal sucks  
big time  
you can tell things aren't going pleasantly , because jimmie gets the infamous ? deer-in-the-headlights' look when anne questions his approach  
and then , the plot ( along with the stupidity of the movie ) thickens  
jimmie's grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies suddenly , leaving a video will behind for his grandson ( who also happens to be his only living relative )  
everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to jimmie  
of course , there's a catch : he must get married before his 30th birthday , stay joined with his bride for an entire decade , and produce healthy children within the first five years  
the bad news is that jimmie's birthday is the following day  
with anne out of town , he must find a willing bride to share his riches with    
and within a very limited time frame  
there are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of `the bachelor'  
for one , the movie's approach is interesting and not dripping with clich ?  
another is the colorful cast  
o'donnell and zellweger are cute together , and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from drowning in it's own mediocrity  
ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure , and james cromwell is sincere and effective as a wise priest dragged through jimmie's marital adventures  
and now the cons : the approach may be interesting , but in trying an old-fashioned method , director gary sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel  
the characters are drawn with obvious , broad strokes , and the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable  
yes , `the bachelor' is far more frustrating than cute  
the screenplay is lamely written , and the subject matter poorly conceived  
the considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted , along with whatever promise the film initially contained  
potential goes out the window early to suit sinyor's `colorful' approach , but not a minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the director's wishes  
`the bachelor' becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it  
you've seen the tv spots , haven't you ? 
o'donnell is madly rushing down a deserted street and the caption reads `what is this man running from ? ' 
in actuality , he's fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him and inherit his fortune ( it's one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film ) "

however , unlike his previous work , the film dwells on a more personal story , and with a female protagonist  
and in no looking back , he stumbles , making a slow , boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work  
claudia ( lauren holly ) is a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life  
she's at a turning point in her life , and feels as if she's going nowhere  
her boyfriend , michael ( jon bon jovi ) , is broke and in a dead end job

he skipped town several years before , without any explanations    even 
for claudia  
he has come back to town to see her , and suddenly she is torn  
should she stay with stable michael , and never escape her hometown    or 
should she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again  
part of the answer lies in the character of her mother ( blythe danner ) , who fell for the wrong man    and has spent her life pining for claudia's father to return  
now it seems that claudia is about to make the same mistakes  
at only a little past ninety minutes , no looking back is rather short for its genre  
unfortunately , it seems much much longer  
the storyline is simple and uninspired , and there's a lack of energy to the whole proceedings , which makes the entire drama rather tedious  
edward burns makes a misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame  
there's no one to restrain his ego , which reigns unchecked  
he walks into the room and lauren holly swoons    yeah , 
right  
lauren holly does what she can with her central character  
but we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions    and 
we never really care  
bon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie  
his acting talents are much greater than they might seem , but he is given a mostly bland and ineffective role to work with  
there's not much to recommend in no looking back "

unfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest , because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes , watching this sad excuse for a movie  
actually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldn't be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie  
not only is it a pathetically bad film overall , but 200 cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever  
the plot is scattered , thin and predictable ; the acting is monumentally bad ; and the style of film making resembles a home video  
it is december 31 , 1981 and the big party is at monica's ( martha plimpton ) house

her 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups  
some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica , and some are total strangers  
but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night's end  
those who are invited are the ones that have the issues  
it is up to those who aren't to help them come to terms  
first there is eric ( brian mccardie ) who is a former boyfriend of monica's and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance , or lack thereof  
he is one of the most bland characters , in a film full of dullness , because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical , a common trait of this poor production  
bridget ( nicole parker ) and caitlyn ( angela featherstone ) who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year's eve and tag along to the party with them  
they stumble across a nameless bartender ( ben affleck ) who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections  
he is nether sexually deprived , nor uncertain about his future , as he is in law school  
his lack of flaws is both boring , unrealistic and painful to watch  
as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy  
moving on , there is val ( christina ricci ) and stephie , ( gabby hoffman ) 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts  
val is monica's cousin and a true fan of the new york scene  
on the other hand , stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can't find  
paradoxically , it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar ( actually they attempt to flee from their presence , but aren't successful ) who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds  
of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples , only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot  
wisely , the movie's creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy ( courtney love ) and kevin ( paul rudd ) who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless  
paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie ( janeane garofalo ) and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship  
however , the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends , and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening  
finally , there are the two worst performances and worst sub-plot of the film  
jack ( jay mohr ) and cindy ( kate hudson ) have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy's virginity the night before  
while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self , he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy  
very often , when a film is as putrid as this production , there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory  
however , this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted  
instead , what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts , bad continuity and inaccuracies  
first , and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another , there is no apparent order that it follows , and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot  
at other times , objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot  
there are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish  
not in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver  
and yet , no matter how miserable this film may be , and no matter how poor the acting is all around , there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots  
perhaps , if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or , perhaps , even three , there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development , or quality acting , or even a decent plot payoff at the end "

starring jason biggs , seann william scott , chris klein , thomas ian nichols , allyson hannigan , shannon elizabeth , natasha lyonne , tara reid , mena suvari , eugene levy , jennifer coolidge  
directed by j  b  rogers  
rated r  
american pie 2 reunites the cast members from american pie in a different setting ; instead of being high school seniors looking to score before they graduate , they are now past their first year of college and have gathered in a beach house to enjoy the summer of their lives  
jim ( jason biggs ) is still an insecure geek looking to improve his performance , oz ( chris klein ) is still the sweetest guy on the block , having sickeningly saccharine phone conversations with his studying-abroad girlfriend , stifler ( seann william scott ) is still a horny stoner , kevin ( thomas ian nichols ) still has no personality and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) still longs for stifler's mom  
have i missed anyone ? 
so , obviously , not much has changed  
this is not a problem , provided that the movie boasts the rapid-fire hilarity and unexpectedly true sentiment of the original  
but american pie 2 is the very definition of "" sequelitis  "" 
it's coarser , yes , and it pushes the envelope even more , but its heart isn't in it  
it's easy cash to capitalize off the first film's success , but it would have been a worthier investment to prolong the franchise by coming up with something original  
part of the reason why the film doesn't work , i think , is that while in the original the kids' quest for sex was a coming-of-age stepping stone as much as an outlet for their horniness  
here , everything has been cheapened  
they behave like those idiot frat boys who kill themselves drinking ; they have no motivation except for sex , sex , beer and sex  
that's not to say that you can't make a decent comedy from that premise , but it is one of american pie 2's undoings  
missing , too , is the sweetness that permeated american pie , the this-could-be-you quality of the main players  
here , the characters are too aware of themselves as pop-culture icons , and they're even more one-note  
stifler and finch are now caricatures while jim , oz and kevin are forced to make awkward self-discoveries at arbitrary moments , none of them betraying what the writers think the audiences want to see  
and then there's the soon-to-be-notorious scene where jim superglues "" himself to himself , "" which perfectly demonstrates yet another of the film's ailments , one that also permeated say it isn't so , director j  b  rodgers' debut  
there's a fine line between comedy and abject humiliation , and american pie 2 is on the wrong side of it  
it's hard to laugh at the characters when you are profoundly embarrassed for them  
i shielded my eyes watching this more than i have watching any horror movie  
if there's one redeeming factor to american pie 2 , it's the inimitable eugene levy as jim's dad , who pops in on jim as he's about to score and utters lines like "" your mother and i have been known to get frisky    
not so much anymore , but    "" 
and then when the girl's parents walk in , blurts out "" this must be your daughter ! 
i didn't get her name , but hopefully my son did  "" 
if only the rest of the movie had the wit and wisdom of levy's performance  
this is an unworthy sequel to a gross-fest that brought back the raunchy teen comedy  
the box-office of this onw should keep the genre going strong , which is disappointing "

-1,"romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant  
with director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top-notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination  
those mentioned films , however , brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not : a solid , well-written screenplay  
call me cynical , but the jobs of writer and producer don't seem to mix well  
gary oldman plays jack grimaldi , a good cop turned bad , selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife  
his cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname , although the name doesn't provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character  
jack has become addicted to "" feeding the hole "" , a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money  
when he realizes his colleagues are being shot , he feebly attempts to get out  
gary oldman's performance is disappointingly weak ; he seems nearly bored  
in the process , he also gets tangled-up with mona demarkov , a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone , played adequately by roy scheider  
demarkov , played by lena olin , is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world  
this character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2  i can't remember seeing a character quite like her  
after being shot , handcuffed , and thrown in the back seat of a car , she still manages to cause an accident , kick out the windshield with her legs , grab a suitcase full of money ( plus some important documentation ) , climb through the rubble , land on her shot leg , and still succeed at running for safety  
what a woman ! 
lena olin's performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film  
anabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeo's wife  
there is little insight into her character  
she's depressed , she makes obvious references , she mopes around the house  
juliette lewis , as romeo's girlfriend , is treated with the same cliche attitudes , although ms  lewis' portrayal certainly didn't improve it  
both women were anything but sexy or attractive  
poorly developed characters aside , the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems  
it is so discouraging to watch a film and want to shout at the main character ( not ) to do something  
for example , jack and his friends attend a funeral to hang in the background to scope-out the mob scene  
fine  
jack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite  
fine  
what does jack proceed to do ? 
he brushes his friends off by telling them he isn't feeling well , then strolls over to the boss  
why ? 
the boss had all ready threatened him ; falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jack's toes by the gravesite  
i guess they weren't worried about any federal agents lingering around after the funeral     
or here's another : demarkov set-up her own death by cutting off her arm with a circular saw  
she proceeded to set the place on fire  
wouldn't the flames burn off the fingerprints ? 
aren't dental records more important ? 
as bright and resourceful as she was supposed to be , couldn't she come up with a better plot ? 
 ( and it took her no time at all to get a good-fitting , functional prosthesis  ) 
lack of attention to detail certainly adds up in a film  
this film doesn't even add up the large details  
there is little or no consistency in the story-line "

-1,"while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks  
and , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year  
the trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it's a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you've seen the animated series on hbo you'll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he's been sent to hell  
todd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else  
not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while  
every character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student  
the story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life  
al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d  b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him  
the next element in the film is the part when things go awry  
and as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al  
as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene  
inevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away  
hence , jason's mischievous master-mind plan , to ` conquer the world "" is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil's army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again  
so , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife  
time passes  
and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc    
this character is merely a poor man's obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla  
now the stage is set spawn , the new `enemy of evil' vs evil  
and evil takes the cake , doubtlessly  
john leguizamo's deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film's relief point  
all this anguish , pain , half-baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so-so one liners  
and then there's martin sheen  
whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years  
his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent  
as the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b-movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot  
this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street  
i'd never thought i'd be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen's career is in better shape  
spawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable  
for most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better  
it constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie  
continually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures are being made  
perhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry  
the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible  
the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting  
it is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton's batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act  
but bruce wayne had human elements to him "

-1,"some movies require you to turn off your brain in order to watch  
then there are movies that require you to accept that everyone * in * the movie has turned off * their * brains  
the real mccoy is both  
it's charmless , molasses-slow and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta , where the real mccoy is set , might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation  
the real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy ( kim basinger ) being arrested in the middle of a job  
six years later , karen is out on parole and looking to stay straight  
she soon bumps into j  t  barker ( val kilmer ) , a hapless would-be thief who idolizes karen  
j  t  also has ties to jack schmidt ( terence stamp ) , the man who blew the whistle on karen six years earlier for refusing to work with him  
schmidt , who is in cahoots with karen's sleazy parole officer ( gailard sartain ) , again wants karen to help him stage a robbery  
this time he has some leverage : karen's kidnapped son  
just when she thought she was out , they keep pulling her back * in  * 
contrivances and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them  
leading the list is the jack schmidt character , who through unexplained but presumably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our story begins  
there is no reason given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime , let alone why he would actually participate in the break-in  
karen's initial encounter with j  t  during a botched convenience store hold-up also strains the limits of credibility  
it would have been simple enough to have them somehow entangled at that point , but instead they run into each other the next day because they're leaving their parole officers at exactly the same moment  
small world , eh ? 
then there's the convenient car trouble during an attempted escape , and pet tigers which , through the power of the laws of bad cinema , must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into their cage  
however , the buffoon prize goes to the atlanta police , who come off like the keystone kops on a bad day  
but the fun doesn't end there in the shambles of a script by william davies and william osborne  
there is also the absence of a single , solitary interesting character  
karen is earnest and single-minded in her motherly devotion , but lacking any kind of edge which would make her a convincing criminal , and basinger is not a thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material  
schmidt is a flaccid villain , the parole officer is a complete blank , and karen's son and ex-husband might as well be furniture  
only kilmer's j  t  is remotely appealing , but his one potentially intriguing quality , his ineptitude , is never developed  
in fact , kilmer disappears during the middle of the film , just when his admiration for karen could have made for an interesting sub-plot  
i might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more appropriate to a caper comedy , but the real mccoy goes nowhere fast  
various scenes of sneaking and skulking seem to take forever , and some end with no reason evident why they didn't end up on the cutting room floor  
even the reasonably clever climactic break-in falls victim to this syndrome , including a scene of one of the thieves drilling open a vault which lasts ( i kid you not ) four minutes  
there is no tension in the scene , just tedium  
russell mulcahy ( highlander ) is a director with some style , and indeed the real mccoy looks reasonably good , but he completely stumbles in the editing room  
there are so many big problems with the real mccoy that i'm tempted to overlook the little ones  
like karen disarming one of schmidt's henchmen and throwing his gun into the middle of a park where her son is playing "

the villains' big idea ? 
kidnap affleck because he used to be a security guard at the casino , force him to tell you where all the doors in the place are , then dress up in santa suits , create some "" diversions "" and rob the place

it occurred to me while i was watching "" house on haunted hill  "" 
it is as follows : if a trailer makes the film it's advertising look like a trashy , stupid movie , well guess what ? 
chances are , there * is * truth in advertising  
too bad i didn't trust my own instincts when something-or-the-other possessed me to see this movie  
i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of "" sleepy hollow  "" 
that and "" dogma "" started too late in the afternoon for my schedule  
an hour of "" angel "" or "" buffy "" is scarier than this doozy that tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face  
i wish i'd seen it when it was halloween  
at least i would have been forgiving  
hey , tis the season  
the movie was scary ( albeit very confusing , dizzying , and nauseating ) at first , but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously wasn't going anywhere  
now i truly appreciate films like "" scream , "" "" halloween , "" or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic  
that's what spooks people out , the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know  
there has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with  
sure , utterly unpredictable is good , too , but that's different from utterly nonsensical  
hohh ( house on haunted hill ) , on the other hand  
  
  
well let's just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they oh-so-cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago  
riiiiight  
y'know , that just sends chills down my spine  
yeah  
just like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil  
ooooooo  
hint : blood and guts only work a few times  
sooner or later people start to tell themselves that it's just ketchup and props and you've got to come up with something better than that  
there were just too many things in this movie that we've all seen before ; from the inevitable "" plot developments "" of strangers unwittingly trapped together ; strangers turning against each other ; the evil manifesting itself ; the dead coming back for a last scare  
each was more predictable than the last  
why didn't these fools just stay together in one place anyways ? 
sheesh  
was i grossed out ? 
yes  
did i get spooked a few times ? 
yes  
but why ? 
i get really disturbed when there is no why  
when there weren't random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect ( which wasn't that good either , trust me ) and the scare , the film was filled with drab , laughable dialogue  
the characters were incredibly flat and cliched  
not to mention downright annoying  
you've got a bunch of people going nowhere in their lives ; of course they're dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night  
jeez , i thought no one fell for those "" you may already be a winner "" things anymore  
and of course , all three gals are babes

-1,"the great actor james woods once said ( and i'm paraphrasing ) , "" if sex isn't messy , then you're not doing it right ""  
a truly profound statement , and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre ( just replace "" sex "" with "" your mad slasher film "" )  
for those uninformed souls , the mad slasher genre ( or sub-genre ) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline : a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween  
urban legend is a mad slasher flick , but one that is so sanitary , bloodless , and nudity free , that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful ( though not overly talented ) cast , it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special  
for film makers , gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in a stale , fright-free horror movie , as stephen king once said ( again paraphrasing ) "" if you can't scare your audience , gross em' out , if you can't do that , make em' laugh ""  
alas , urban legend succeeds only at the latter , though not by intention  
i actually find the fact that this film became a minor success ( $40 million domestic box office gross ) more frightening than anything in it  
it seems that audiences' tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt  
the promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills , but how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them  
unfortunately , these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations ; one idiotic super-hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films don't need to do anything more than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering  
if anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin , wild wild west , and godzilla  
but forget all that , it goes without saying that mad slasher films ( or any other exploitation off-shoot ) will be made without an ounce of craft ( especially considering the sheer volume that are produced )  
allow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film : the lack of enthusiastic exploitation  
these flicks aren't harnessed with any lofty aspirations , so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time ? 
sadly out of the literally hundreds made , i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while  
and urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three  
despite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame , it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes  
as far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend's setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities : it takes place on a college campus , which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer  
you see , the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface  
all those young people are growing up together , going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows , so naturally some weirdness is expected  
all the better for that elusive crazed killer  
coupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around , and the introduction of a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy task  
but alas , urban legend is not only idiotic and clich ? ? full ; it's way too clean , a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity , little gore , and much stupidity  
this is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than , i dunno , exercise  
it's the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a running-like-the-wind-prey , yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques  
it's the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack  
i really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loud-noise-jump-scare thing  
yes the audience jumps , momentarily frightened , but wouldn't anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated a quiet room  
i lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse of the killer  
apparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers  
in scream it was a ghost mask ( scary enough ) , in i know what you did last summer it was a fisher man's rain slicker ( in the middle of summer no less ) , and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody : the villain wears an oversized parka with a fury hood ( ooh ? ? ? scary ) intended to conceal his/her identity  
for urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume  
though i must admit , urban legend does have a winning premise for what could have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film  
the film's killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends ( you know , like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that they're coming from inside the house )  
i won't spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used , after all the film does offer fine 2 : 00 am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough  
sad to say , it doesn't include my favorite urban legend : a fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and a very unhappy gerbil  
now that would be scary  
before i leave you , i would like to bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film ( the first being the lack of craft , the second the lack of exploitation ) -- its characters , all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people i've ever spent an evening with  
only jared leto ( looking like a carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day ) and alicia witt , as the resilient heroine , avoid vexatiousness  
the most annoying of the bunch is a tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum , as a supremely irritating lout ( so irritating i actually cheered his painful death , and i am not a cruel person ) "

effeminate , mild-mannered karl is about to take a beatng from a bunch of ruffians at school as he bathes himself under a shower , his genitals tucked between his legs in the manner of a posing transvestite  
he is only just saved by prentice , who appears in all respects barring his protective attitude towards karl to be your average street-wise punk-in-the-making  
the ensuing scene ends up with both boys being ridiculed and then unfairly expelled from the school  
they do not see each other for another eighteen yeas  
in that time , prentice has matured into a somewhat loveable , if brash and bull-heaed goon who screws up his jobs and relationships while gamely clinging onto perennial adolescence via lether jackets , motorcycles and punk rock music  
karl , on the other hand , has grown up to become kim , a drabby , insecure woman who works as a verse writer for a greeting card company  
chance brings the two together , and love , such as will inevitably blossom in your quirky british romantic comedy , is what this skewed little story is largely about  
if at this point you think you're going to get any cheap laughs with that gender-bending theme ( see the birdcage , to wong foo    , priscilla queen of the desert ) , you can just go home and brood on your own maladjusted sexuality you low-life deadbeat  
kim is a post-operative transsexual , thank you very much    
a new-born woman for all purposes , with confusions and sensitivities that deserve treatment with a touch of delicacy  
personally , give me those cheap laughs any day  
i'd rather enjoy obvious camp than endure the shallow exploration of a soft- hearted transsexual love story  
different for girls comes up with a promising enough proposition , but does nothing that surpasses the merely workmanlike with it  
by refusing to make the audience really uncomfortable with the notion of kim and prentice's relation- ship , or at the very least feel uncomfortable for them ( prentice for example , doesn't seem to give hiself all that much grief when he becomes attracted to kim despite being a fight-picking , beer-drinking , macho kind of guy , and kim , for all her insecurities and fears is always saved any truly disturbing victimisation in the film ) , and instead drawing them into a basically wimpy love story , the film manages to lobotomise itself  
lightweight comedy as it's doomed to be , it could've still have hacked it with the requisitive endearing couple  
but this doesn't either , since even mrs doubtfire is sexier than steven mackintosh's kim foyle , and as either sex , he's just plainly a simpering wanker nobody should like  
prentice does though , and that's never explained  
but then rupert graves gives us so heroic performance as prentice , the guy who never grew up ( and if there is a bafta prize for most convincing portrayal of a rabid fan at a buzzcocks' concert , he should win that too ) that i guess there's no reason to explain why he's so screwed up  
if oddly enough you grow to like this show , you'll be wanting your happy ending , and the film won't fail you there either  
snide underling at kim's office gets her come-uppance  
misogynistic police officer who beats up prentice gets his come-uppance  
the couple prevail against a disagreeable society and come together in kim's apartment  
kim's sister and her impotent sarge-type husband kiss and make up after a tiff ( tv movie sub-plot with incidental juxtaposition )  
and best of all , kim sheds her insecurities and learns how to ride the motorcycle and wear leathers , making prentice ride pilion  
awwww  
terrific closure  
happy ending  
but just what is it that's differnt for girls anyway ? 
if you figure that one out , let me know

the following review contains some harsh language * * * 
the blair witch project  
quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time  
if you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace , because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy  
my colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more , then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more  
and this worked for him  
well , i'm sorry , but nothing    
is nothing ! ! ! ! ! 
nothing is not more  
it's nothiiiiiinggggggggggg ! ! ! ! ! !  
i do not pay 5 dollars to see nothing  
 "" nothing "" is free , available all around the world at a location near you  
i am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary  
i could just discount them and say , "" well , i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow  "" 
but i have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesn't hold water  
there must be some other reason  
 ( then again , maybe my first thought is correct , i think i'll try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction  ) 
when i hear people praising this film , i never hear them talking about what makes up about 97% of this movie : three kids bickering with each other about being lost  
they only talk about what might make up possibly 3 to 4 minutes of screen time  
this being a few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout "" josh ! ! "" 
over and over  
this film should not be called the blair witch project , it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost    
and argue with each other  
oh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting "" josh ! ! ""  
and if you thought that was scary , wait till you see a pile of rocks , and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs , oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear  
oh yeah , and some goo on one of their backpacks  
you've never seen terror like this folks , and you don't want to  
the chevy chase/goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film  
 ( for current films , i highly recommend the sixth sense or a stir of echoes for a creepy filmgoing experience  ) 
this film is an example of marketing with no substance  
the marketing was brilliant , and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film  
they want this film to be good  
and i think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they don't have anything else to praise  
that wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along , but this is not it  
this film could have been so much better "

not alcohol and drugs = good  
got it ? "" 
just when you though you've seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen , be that insanity or alcoholism , hollywood releases yet another one of those 'deep , emotional stories about finding yourself'   
'28 days' is practically a visualization of the usual 'meaningful' true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aa-meetings  
gwennie ( sandra bullock ) is a young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol  
for her life was a big party , with no beginning and no end  
this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself  
her existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes  
such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper ( dominic west ) , borrowed her sister's ( elizabeth perkins ) wedding limo and crashed it into someone's house  
this time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in court-ordered rehab  
here she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption , willpower and commitment  
most important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big party  
the film itself feels like a rehab program , whining and moaning about things that have been said and written a million times  
it is a classic cautionary tale  
an echo  
a big , fat and expensive clich ?  
a shadow of last year's 'girl , interrupted' , which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like 'the cuckoo's nest' and 'trainspotting'  
director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors , that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review  
for some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a drama/comedy  
jokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues : alienation , despair , terror , confusion , loneliness  
and what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean  
isn't that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place ? 
even the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park  betty thomas' idea of hell is a cozy , homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke , drink or watch tv after 11  
it is simply too light , simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously  
but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance  
that it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story  
 "" all you need to do is just say no "" , says dr  cornell ( steve buscemi ) as if was the revelation of the century  
and that's how simple it is ! 
in fact i would rather watch 'lost in space' once again , than return to '28 days'  
as for acting , it's acceptable , but hardly anything else  
for sandra bullock it's an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than 'speed'  
she handles her part with a surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete flop  
dominic west shines as the source of gwenie's devilish temptations , but elizabeth perkins' and steve buscemi's great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters  
although intellectually 'girl , interrupted' was a greater achievement , '28 days' is superior in its visual aspect  
there are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing , but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor  
the most important thing is that we've seen it before and it was a lot better  
'clean and sober' , 'only when i laugh' , 'when a man loves a woman' , 'leaving las vegas' and many other stronger films were made about the same issues  
so what's the point ? 
in other words '28 days' doesn't contribute to the moviemaking business on any level "

-1,"roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , "" who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by    
ben kingsley ? "" 
my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it  
they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles  
the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious  
that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast  
gary "" gal "" dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain  
life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing  
but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch  
the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa  
the second punch comes from gal's past  
back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal  
he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal  
don will accept any decision gal makes from "" yes "" to "" certainly  "" 
however , if gal says "" no "" don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy's ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman )  
in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody's skin  
kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness  
there are some serious problems in louis mellis's and david scinto's script that should have been caught before filming  
when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success  
beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him  
any local hood could have done what gal is needed for  
additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault  
no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool  
in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar  
i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade  
the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability  
the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im  
it is not a great plot  
in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards  
perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film  
it is an old plot dressed up to look new  
if the plot is old , at least the style is creative  
this is director jonathan glazer's first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout  
his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences  
cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes  
we see one side of a person's faces  
but the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit  
half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden "

-1,"this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be "" one of the hottest writers in hollywood ""  
he wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream ( 8/10 ) , then added the successful i know what you did last summer ( 7  5/10 ) 
script to his mix , and also created the popular tv series "" dawson's creek ""  
so when he asked to direct his first movie , based on his first ever script written , everyone and their grandma said "" sure , go for it ! ""  
uhhm , my question is    did anyone bother reading this stupid script ? ? ? 
plot : ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west , mrs  tingle , and set to lose her scholarship to college  
when she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story , they end up tying her up , and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman  
critique : it's not so much that this is a bad movie , than the fact that it sucks  
this movie is chock-full of one-dimensional characters , contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on , zero tension or thrills , plot holes the size of my big ass , lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie , and molly ringwald , vivica a  fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles  
i was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery ( 8/10 ) and 9 to 5 , but unfortunately for williamson , he went nowhere with the bright foundation , making references to the exorcist and dr  
zhivago , which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate  
he also forgot about suspense , with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions , unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue  
sure , katie holmes is cute , and her co-star , marisa coughlan , did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist ( worth two points out of my three on ten ) , but how can we forgive the biggest one-dimensional character in any film , holmes' rival in the film , mrs  tingle's complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her ( are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays ? ) and a transparent romance between holmes and some long-haired dude , hired to be the poor man's version of skeet ulrich ( who himself is a poor man's version of johnny depp ! )  
all in all , this movie was laughable for me , provided me with no insight into anything , demonstrated williamson's genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script , and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into , unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability , humanity or capacity to comprehend  
no hip lines , no cheap thrills , just a dull time at the movie theater  
if you want to see a funny teenage movie , go see detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) , and thank my drunken , sorry ass in the morning  
little known facts about this film and its stars : kevin williamson's father was a fisherman  
kevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in i know what you did last summer ( 7  5/10 )  
he is also a huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally , so is dawson leery on tv's "" dawson's creek "" , a show kevin created  
he was once an aspiring actor  
in fact , he even landed a bit part on tv's "" another world ""  
also , williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs  tingle , which is also loosely based on the book "" killing mr  griffin "" by the writer of i know what you did last summer ( 7  5/10 ) , 
lois duncan  
he has also come out and said that he is a gay man  
helen mirren was born in london , england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff  
she is married to director taylor hackford , whose works include devil's advocate ( 8/10 ) and an officer and a gentleman ( 8  5/10 )  
this film was originally titled killing mrs  
tingle , but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident  
actress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project called "" wasteland ""  
this is actor barry watson first full feature film "

-1,"ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film ; i have a problem even regarding it as a film  
it's more of a show , a big commercial for ted turner's world championship wrestling ( wcw )  
the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page , goldberg , and sting  
the story is very minimal and basic  
there are these two guys , gordy ( david arquette ) and sean ( scott caan )  
they are two twenty-something wrestling fans from wyoming  
when they go to a live event for the big match up , there favorite wrestler jimmy king ( oliver platt ) is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus ( joe pantoliano )  
gordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus' plans  
on the way , they meet some people , have some fun , and clean up some port-o-potties  
sounds great huh , well it's not  
the movie makes many attempts at humor , only a few of them work  
the jokes that make you laugh , however , do not outnumber the film's many duds  
there is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa  
the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back  
i especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquette's tag team partner is 'macho man' randy savage  
they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor  
the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan  
mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl , the cheerleaders of the wcw  
she becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice , funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan's breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face  
now what didn't work in this movie ? 
that would be the rest of it  
the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets  
the two lead characters work for a port-o-potty cleaning company and when they crash the truck , the excrements spill all over the road  
it's not funny ; it's pathetic and brainless  
the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way  
i watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie  
the main characters in the film actually get to wrestle , like that would happen to any fan , especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set  
also , i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily ; they just walked right in  
i like wrestling  
i watch it at home and laugh  
it's continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldn't watch it  
this movie wasn't even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv  
the only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew  
the funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently  
the movie was too dim-witted to be funny  
it is possibly the most useless and under-developed film ever  
a recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film , detroit rock city  
that movie was interesting , well done and continuously funny unlike this film  
the acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh  
now that the scream trilogy is over , arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb 1-800-call-att ads "

-1,"14 years ago , national lampoon introduced us to a new family - the griswolds  
in 1983 , the griswolds embarked on a cross-country journey with the destination of wally world , a world-renowned theme park in california  
we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured  
two years later , we watched again as they went to europe , and four years after that , we shared christmas with them  
now , eight more years have passed , and the laughs have done more than die  
they've been cremated  
vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold , the good intentioned but ill-fated father of two  
the premise is basically the same  
clark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation , this time to las vegas  
his wife ellen ( beverly d'angelo ) and teenage kids rusty and audrey ( always played by different actors - this time around , by ethan embry and marisol nichols , respectively ) join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick  
of course a "" vacation "" movie wouldn't be complete without good ole eddie ( reprised by randy quaid ) , the misfit cousin , showing up at all the wrong times  
there isn't too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it  
it's really just a skit movie  
there are a couple of ways to define a skit movie , which is not a real term as far as i know  
the first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours , therefore coming off like a two hour skit  
the second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits , each lasting about five minutes  
vegas vacation comes off like the first  
a good example of the latter would be last year's black sheep  
the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast , and it doesn't really fit into a movie mold  
in these cases , a "" plot "" , which is generally very thin , is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags ( i  e  
have a good vegas joke , make a vegas movie )  
such is the case with this movie's mini-plots  
clark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold's money , ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton ( ! ) , rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage , and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie ( shae d'lyn ) as an exotic dancer  
the simple fact is : this movie isn't funny  
at first , i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes , but when the movie got rolling , my interest suddenly stopped  
chase plays clark griswold really well  
he made the character and he is the character  
d'angelo , to be quite honest , never was too impressive as ellen , and this movie doesn't show any signs of redemption  
as for the two new griswold kids , the word "" blah "" comes to mind  
the "" vacation "" series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters , the simple reason being that there is nothing to them  
they're so generic , you'll expect the credits to read "" girl #1 as audrey griswold ""  
vegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor  
yes , it's true that vegas vacation isn't even close to being close to being as funny as the others , which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways , but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart  
first off , why did they leave off the national lampoon's heading on the title ? 
i couldn't find any reasons why , but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn't want to be associated with such a lame film  
that's saying a lot , especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented : loaded weapon 1 , pcu , etc  if they expected this to be another hit , you would assume they'd be proud to tack on the notorious header , but for reasons only we can guess at , like the movie sucking , they didn't  
there is another difference here that makes an obvious impact  
the first three films in the "" vacation "" series were written by john hughes , a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80's including mr "

-1,"well there goes another one  
sadly this like other movies this year wasn't good  
this one being almost as bad as 'the omega code' but not quite  
from the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad , and well i guess i was right  
with bad excuses for acting , a horrible screenplay and straight-out bad direction 'the bachelor' is a terribly unfunny movie that doesn't work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance  
the two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best  
the movie is troubled from the start because chris o'donnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date  
here is the stupid plot : chris o'donnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend , he meets anne ( rene zellwegar ) they instantly hit it off and are together for three years  
jimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up  
he really doesn't realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her ( what he wants i never did catch )  
so he proposes in a really bad way , and she shoots him down and is very mad  
he of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any  
then his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars     as 
long as he marries before the next day at 6 : 05 pm  
now jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her , or get married to someone else to get the money itself , leading to an un-funny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths  
ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest , cliched , silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs  
even the supporting roles of artie lange , hal holbrook and ed anser aren't even good  
the plot was a good idea , but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old  
the choppy dialogue and bad directing don't help things any  
even though chris o'donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies , he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him  
rene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming , sweet and likable performance ( as usual ) and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout  
her sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen  
brooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a big-headed mogul who after a while became routine and old  
one really can't help but think that we have seen this stuff before  
it's not like this is an original idea and in the end , everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness  
'the bachelor' works on no good levels and in fact doesn't work at all  
ed anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul , and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career  
chris o'donnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal  
he seems held back and really doesn't get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old  
artie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and un-nerving  
why the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie , with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know  
maybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success , and sometimes i don't agree with other critics on movies , even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts  
its based on the 1925 silent film 'seven chances' which i am sure is very better than this mess  
even though some may think of this as a good date movie , most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back  
besides being a terrible movie , 'the bachelor' is well a terrible movie  
it has nothing worth recommending therefore i really can't recommend this movie "

the truck is driven by arlo ( cuba gooding jr  ) and mason ( skeet ulrich ) , who have been instructed by a dying scientist to transport a deadly chemical weapon to a military base by the name of fort mcgruder  
this particular weapon ( nicknamed `elvis' ) must be kept below a temperature of 50 degrees , or else the shockwave will goo-iffy everything in a mile radius  
that would be pretty nasty  
the power of elvis is revealed in the opening scene , as dr  richard long ( david paymer ) conducts a test on an isolated tropical island  
long accidentally melts 18 soldiers and defoliates virtually the entire island , due to an enormously miscalculated safety distance  
the commanding officer , general brynner ( peter firth ) , is sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of his troops  
upon his release , the general is intent on tracking the good doctor down , snatching elvis , and selling the weapon to the highest international bidder  
protecting the fate of the world is a drifting hamburger flipper ( ulrich ) and a feisty ice cream delivery man ( gooding jr  ) , who must elude brynner's men and get elvis to safety at fort mcgruder  
all the while , of course , they must keep the weapon below 50 degrees  
this proves to be tricky  
among the wild adventures arlo and mason partake in is a trip down a tree-covered mountainside in a boat , and a fist fight on top of a moving vehicle  
they also crack a few dozen witty retorts that we are supposed to find amusing  
to put it simply , i'll use a clever pun : chill factor should be put on ice  
director hugh johnson has mixed elements from speed , broken arrow and the lethal weapon series to create a lifelessly bland cocktail of a chase movie  
when there is some occasional action , the audience seems oddly detached from it  
perhaps that's because we've already waded through a pool of clich ? s and boring dialogue ; all material that's been used before , and with a lot more spice  
take the villains , for example  
they are typical stereotypes of every terrorist that has ever walked the silver screen  
they speak lines that have been recycled profusely from one movie to the next , divulge important plot details while holding their enemies at gunpoint , and act in very predictable ways  
the tag-team of gooding jr  and ulrich sounds much more exciting than it is  
frankly , i'm not sure i can accept cuba as an ice cream man  
i suppose it's better than him dressed like a giant hot dog , selling jumbo frankfurters on a street corner  
gooding displays one single emotion in this movie , which is frequently on display in lines like `i'm gonna get on yo ass like last year's underwear ! ' and the incessant sputtering of `oh , sh * t ! ' 
this is virtually the same character he played in jerry maguire and as good as it gets  
but where gooding was once an exciting actor , he now seems dull and endlessly monotonous  
at least he's a bit more captivating than ulrich , who has all the film's worst dialogue , but does nothing noticeable to enliven his character  
the supporting cast , which includes every personality you expect to pop up , is also wasted  
to be fair , there are a few brief moments of serviceable action  
and i did chuckle a few times  
one example is when ulrich ( an employee at `darlene's diner' ) is at the counter when brynner walks through the door  
`you own this place ? ' 
the general asks  
`yeah , ' ulrich says  
`they call me darlene  ' 
these little tidbits of humor are ( mainly ) welcome in this weak , disappointing wreckage of an action film  
as a speed clone , it could have benefited from a lot more suspense and perhaps ( god forbid ) even some decent writing "

-1,"the tagline for this film is : "" some houses are just born bad ""  
so i didn't expect too much from this  
but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre  
i thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont  
i thought , mabe it will be fun ? 
and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing  
but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ?  
these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality  
here is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation  
among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor )  
actually , the doctor is researching the "" primordial fear reaction "" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens  
but he gets unexpected help from the house itself  
it rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights  
portals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs  
a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth  
filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains  
but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen  
the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture  
is that exciting or what ? 
the worst thing about it is that it didn't have to be bad  
it's based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , '' by shirley jackson  
a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent  
it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience  
 "" the blair witch project "" , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses  
and with a $70 mill  
budget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror  
de bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening  
he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush  
but why give him a more serious material ? 
in the end "" haunting "" will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont's career as a director  
yet it wouldn't be fair to say that everything is bad  
the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky  
but this is where the good things end  
the music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is absolutely without life  
it's nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza ; visually impressive , but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn't engage  
at first you do not know what's going on  
is this part of the experiment ? 
are these hallucinations ? 
projections of the subconscience ? 
paranoia ? 
but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening  
the house is actually possessed  
it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window  
for ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that's what i got ? 
i believe hichock once said that "" it's better to wait for a climax , than to see one ""  
this may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only stupid  
they are impossible to take seriously "

-1,"it seems that i've stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch  
take payback , for example , a movie that most people seem to like  
however , it's horrible schlock , straight out of hollywood's vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies  
it was written and directed by a guy who should have done better ; however , maybe he did do better , after all , 30 percent of the movie isn't his own  
mel gibson , that hollywood zombie , decided he didn't like the ending and had another director reshoot it  
what a crock  
if you sign on to do a movie , then do it the way the script calls for  
why film a movie and then look at it later and say , - no , i changed my mind , i don't like the ending  
you're fired  
let's get someone else to do it  
- i suppose honor is dead in hollywood  
the end of the film is , of course , hollywoodized  
which is to say that it's happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize  
in this case , as is most victories in hollywood movies , gibson's prize is a blond and money  
i miss originality in film , i really do  
i think audiences are so starved for it that they'll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original  
payback's tagline - get ready to root for the bad guy - promised an original idea , but it was far from the truth  
while gibson's character certainly broke the law , he was a character that had honor ( odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it ) , wouldn't kill in front of children and protects his blond woman  
there's nothing bad about him - he's a hollywood character , a person who could never exist in real life  
and gibson knows it - he spends his time trying to act like a "" bad guy "" , and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant  
the story involves gibson being double-crossed by his partner ( who is a real bad guy , which made me wish that we could root for him ) over $70 , 000  
gibson recovers from multiple gunshots , is pissed ( naturally ) , and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back - no more , no less  
he makes a point of it that it's strictly 70 grand  
a real bad guy would have made his ex-partner pay 25% interest  
this idea is completely stretched out  
gibson ends up going after his partner and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with  
what i didn't understand - this is the chicago mafia  
$70 , 000 is like spare change to them  
they'd probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him  
i think they'd respect a guy going through this much trouble for a simple $70 , 000  
maybe i'm being too hard on the movie  
perhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make a simple popcorn movie  
i read roger ebert's review and he liked gibson in the role because he is a comic at heart playing a bad guy  
that's why we're allowed to root for him  
and it's true - gibson walks the movie as if he's smiling at a joke he just heard  
but he's wrong here  
i wanted a lee marvin or old-time clint eastwood or somebody who wasn't a comic , just an ass kicker  
as a side note , i've just checked the internet movie database and discovered that i am the 38th person to post a newsgroup review of payback  
after this many reviews , why would anyone want to read this ? 
really , i don't care "

for those of us who haven't read the james lee burke novel that heaven's prisoners is based on , do not rabidly go out and buy tickets to movies featuring the combined talents of alec baldwin and eric roberts , feel vaguely depressed by the notion of swamps , gangsters with louisiana accents , plots , sub-plots , more plots , and well , really just want to see teri hatcher naked , this is one movie you're going to worry the price of admission over  
hopeful still ? 
well , let me share my moment of sheer panic , and then the cold enervation of the big let-down when a semi-robed hatcher purrs to alec baldwin , "" what do you think of my butterfly ? ""  
butterfly ? , 
i asked myself , what butterfly ? ! 
and then it hit me    
the scene had been snipped ! 
damn you , godless pg rating , show us her butterfly ! ! 
we want to see the goddamn butterfly ! ! ! 
so    
no naked teri hatcher  
forget about that  
okay ? 
now    
heaven's prisoners is about ex-alchoholic ex-cop dave robicheaux ( alec baldwin ) who's trying to discover life anew running a bait shop and boat hire business with his loving , down-to-earth wife annie ( kelly lynch )  
everything dull , but hunky dory until a plane carrying illegal immigrants crashes almost ontop of the couple while they're on their boat  
the plane nosedives into the water and sinks , but from its wreckage robicheaux rescues a little pixie-faced salvadoran girl whom he and his wife immediately decide to adopt  
what they don't realise is that the plane's pilot was also a drug dealer , and that the plane had been sabotaged by the latter's erstwhile colleagues  
when robicheaux discovers this , he predictably , against the advice of his wife , a well-meaning dea agent , and two gangsters who rough him up , begins 'poking his nose where it don't belong' , we know that the man deserves all the misery he's going to get  
the question now is whether or not you want to be dragged along for the ride through a tedious , meandering yet utterly suspenseless plot with an unlovable hero as your guide  
as dave robicheaux , alec baldwin is fat    
no seriously , this is not the svelte , thinking man's hero of the hunt for red october , it is an out-of-shape guy who doesn't look too good in a roof-top chasing scene  
he's also unconvincing in the movie's dramatic moments , acting with what as far as i can tell is a steven segal-like economy of expression  
three-quarters of the way through the show , while you're probably waiting for the next scene in a bar where robicheaux contemplates succumbing to the temptation of the whiskey bottle , getting drunk and beating up someone or getting beaten up , you'll want to beat on him a little yourself  
on the other hand , mary stuart masterson ( some kind of wonderful , fried green tomatoes , benny & joon ) cast as a down-and-out stripper who has her fingers broken is quite a breath of fresh air , with just the right mix of cynicism , warmth , insecurity and humour to be the movie's only endearing character  
eric roberts as bubba rocque , always believable as the woman-abusing bad guy who knows how to box ( see final analysis , coincidentally also directed by phil joanou ) is believable here as the woman-abusing bad guy who knows how to box  
and lest we forget teri hatcher's role in all this , this being her rather well-publicised paid vacation from playing lois lane on tv's "" adventures of lois & clark ""    
she is totally ridiculous as rocque's manipulative and seductive cajun wife , coming across as devious as a mildly disgruntled au pair who's trying to get back at an employer who hasn't been giving her enough days off  
it's probably safe to say that her day job beckons  
and at the end of our day , none of this is really worth 2 hrs and 12 minutes of our personal misery  
the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video  
 * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 
 * * * pretty good , bring a friend  
 * * * * amazing , potent stuff

-1,"i love movies  
i really do  
every time i watch great movies like goodfellas ( 1990 ) or raiders of the lost ark ( 1981 ) , a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent , skill and entertainment that is on display  
even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1/3 ( 1994 ) or ghostbusters ii ( 1988 ) while not exactly brilliantly well made , are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value  
then there's my favourite martian , the exact opposite of what a movie should be : a hurried , poorly written and acted movie with one goal , to make money  
disney , ever since the lion king ( 1994 ) have lost their magic touch , but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk  
christopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t  v reporter's tim o'hara car ( daniels ) , and soon tim finds the martian in his home , trying to recover and fix his spaceship  
along with his 'zoot' spacesuit , voiced by wayne knight , must fix his spaceship before it explodes , and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public , firstly by o'hara , but later by rival t  v presenter brace channing ( hurley ) , by calling himself tim's 'uncle martin  ' 
'laughter' is supposed to arise from the 'comical' events , but never does  
many bad films have good intentions , but my favourite martian doesn't appear to try to provide any entertainment  
filled to the brim with wham bang special effects , my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy  
christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie , i've never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now  
jeff daniels plays 'staple nice guy' and his role is useless  
his performance is incredibly lazy , although his paperthin character doesn't deserve more than the performance he gives  
darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever , but her role is somewhat , erm , limited  
hurley mistakes 'acting' for 'shouting and looking like a twit' and wins the david wilcock award for 'most irritating , godawful performance in a moving picture  ' 
way to go liz ! 
for the supporting cast , disney manage to assemble every character actor out there , during the film i was going 'he was the guy in    ah   er    ' 
before finally giving up and switching off  
another major setback is the staple 'comedy sidekick  ' 
unfortunately , the writers ( sherri stoner and deanna oliver , if anyone cares ) forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be 'funny  ' 
instead , they deliver zoot , the martians deeply unfunny sidekick  
although meant to be a manic character no doubt , every line that comes out of his 'neck' is a dud  
a real dud  
citizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester  
even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character : not one child even bothered to smirk  
it's a nice special effect , though  
another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves  
or rather , the lack of them  
my favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour : it goes past the bowl , down the pipe and into the sewer  
now , toilet humour can be funny , as dumb and dumber ( 1994 ) humorously showed "

-1,"synopsis : cro-magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion  
reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy-style , ayla grows up to become a blond , feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate  
comments : allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies  
she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner  
the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title  
not even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese  
it's so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it's oddly fascinating  
the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out  
the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m  auel  
to this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following  
i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother  
i have never read this book , but i sure hope it's 10 , 000 times better than its film adaptation  
if not , then i'm at a complete loss to explain its popularity  
the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene  
a young ayla , looking much like drew barrymore in e  t  , 
tramps about in the woods  
with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her , the audience's expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered  
what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla's mother ( a blonde with fur pants    er , 
leggings )  
tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera    well , 
as the earthquake slowly recedes  
a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch , but the screaming six-year-old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven  
i won't detail the story any further ; this seems enough to illustrate my point  
this movie is really stupid  
it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief  
also , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston  
the movie doesn't just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four  
a blond , gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs  
she's of the "" new people "" ; they're of the "" old people "" with "" the memories  "" 
yep  
we get it  
we get it  
the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up , which surprises me "
-1,"various films seen at the seattle film festival : 
it's all true/three men on a raft ( u  s  a  , 1942/1986 ) director : orson welles 
a recently uncovered one-fourth of orson welle's planned "" docu-drama "" of amazing stories around the world named it's all true , this short dealt with welle's attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft  
while several clips of the film are seen , the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle's attempts to film it , despite studio problems , a staggering workload , and extremely ill fortune on the set  
impressive photography , but really only interesting to film historians  
sadie thompson ( u  s  a  , 1928 ) director : raoul walsh screenwriter : raoul walsh , from the john colton play "" rain "" , based on w  somerset maugham's story "" miss thompson "" cast : gloria swanson , raoul walsh , lionel barrymore silent 
after the discussion of the newly-restored version of frank capra's lost horizon , where several scenes had been restored using stills , i was interested to see sadie thompson , where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago  
this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story "" miss thompson ""  
this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen--little awkwardness , and a very clever script  
the actors : gloria swanson , raoul walsh ( who also directed and wrote the screenplay ) and especially lionel barrymore , as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie's soul , but really wants to get her between the sheets , is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel  
swanson adds real life to the character , adding an worldly , affectionate air to the bawdy sadie  
unfortunately , the ending is rather poorly tied up ; it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live-action film , or the original script  
the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on ( i cannot believe maugham's short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia ) ; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we've been waiting an hour and a half for  
still , it's entertaining right up to the end ; certainly barrymore's incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the silent screen ) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells , bakkers , and robertses of the religious worlds  
a c movie ; worth 2  50 if you can find it  
the pied piper ( czechoslovakia , 1986 ) director : jim barta screenwriter : kamil piza 
this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids  
it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate , and with a lot of political comment along with it  
perhaps economic content is a better word--it certainly doesn't show capitalism in a good light  
nor human nature , nor anything else , for that matter  
as you may have guessed , this is not a tgif film ; this is the kind of film you are glad is over  
not that it wasn't interesting for technical reasons ; this is stop-animation that is very well done  
all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts--except for the animated stuffed rats  
boy , sounds like a real comedy vehicle , doesn't it ? 
add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison , and you have something to give the wee ones ( and some of the mentally unstable larger folk ) to keep them up at night  
some gore  
don't bring children to this one  
don't bring adults to this one , unless they're fascinated by puppetry and/or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped  
blech  
  no fun whatsoever  
meier ( west germany , 1986 ) director/screenwriter : peter timm cast : rainier grenkowitz , nadja engelbrecht , alexander hauff , thomas besvater sub-titled 
this film takes us back and forth over the east german/west german border with meier , an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money  
his uncle ( also in the west ) sneaks meier out of the country , unknown to the east germans  
meier , however , is less than thrilled-- his girlfriend , his friends and his job ( which he likes ) all exist in east germany  
after a round-the-world trip ( his boss think's he's on leave in bulgaria ) , meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id , and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew's work--while everyone think's he's still living in east germany  
of course , something goes wrong--and the ending is very funny , but it takes the film too long to get there "

-1,"paul verhoeven , the dutch auteur who dragged his violent , sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film , has never been what i'd consider a thoughtful director ( though some of his films , notably starship troopers , have been lauded as artistic achievements ) , but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who's managed to , no matter what the budget , make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils  
starship troopers was essentially a b-monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange ( a great film that's nearly impossible to find on video , yet showgirls is everywhere ) , in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ; the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards ( who may actually be 45% silicone ) , in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage  
it's not a completely successful film , but as a failure it's certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining ) one  
my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores ; spetters , a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange ( haven't yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight )  
i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop , a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic hero that's as touching as schwarzenegger's in t2  
that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics  
its violence seemed to be there for a purpose , namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread , not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience  
there's a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him  
he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim's every fearful tic  
it's a startling moment of barbaric , maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk-noir  
in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won't shut up , he impales a co-worker , drowns another and so on  
but why ? 
his character is introduced as a smug genius , the kind who's always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear , sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place , though once the character becomes invisible , this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster  
the kind who just won't die  
hollow man's protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda ( elizabeth shue , acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm ) and her lover , a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who's saddled with the film's worst lines ( "" i've lost cohesion again ! "" )  
they're a typical aaron spelling couple , good-looking but as vacant as george w  bush's republican national convention speech ( i  e  
bush referring to clinton ; "" ? ? ? so much promise ? ? ? but to what end ? 
to what end ? "" -- 
this actually got applause ! 
suddenly warren beatty doesn't look so absurd )  
the rest of the film's characters are all well past thirty , though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained one-liners ; is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood's new character developing technique ? 
ahh , what a cynical time we live in ? ? ? 
as the picture opens we meet cain ( kevin bacon ) , an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret ( so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation's ) project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility ( for what purpose is never hinted at )  
they've performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine , in a twist worthy of the film's 1950's late show origins , to impulsively experiment on himself  
caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co-workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead  
our mad scientist is turned invisible ( after several fx-heavy complications ) , then he inexplicably ( it's hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures , but this is never explored , and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human ? ) 
begins raping , assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases , always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger  
it grows abundantly clear with each new release that it's verhoeven's films that have become hollow  
like the rest , this one is cold , heartless , and full of contempt for humanity , but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit , insight and makes no statement other than "" audiences will pay for anything these days ""  
it's an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level , or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun , thrill-a-minute ride  
verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care  
the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick  
how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self ? 
a couple weeks ago , after seeing the trailer , a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability  
hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa , in a serious manner to boot  
but oh yeah , it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway  
verhoeven delivers the sleazy "" goods "" , but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner , here it just feels icky and uncomfortable  
the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses , caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux-psycho music strains in the background  
it's plainly obvious that verhoeven isn't exploring voyeurism ( like in the classic peeping tom ) but exploiting it and not even doing that very well  
it's funny that with all the technology $90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a woman's naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand  
most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks  
in fact it's largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since , by the end , most of his potential victims don infer-red glasses that track his body heat  
as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov ( a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre ) , and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked  
the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy  
it happens when a lab assistant ( kim dickens , who looks like she stepped out of playboy ) in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon , suddenly pauses "

book of shadows : blair witch 2 
a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman 
certain things in our lives are inevitable  
death , sorrow , love , heartbreak , pain , joy  
we expect these events  
we know they're going to happen and some , we even look forward to  
it's part of the human condition  
we have also become accustomed to inevitable occurrences in our society  
as we near the fall election , several of them are hitting us in the face  
politicians exaggerate their own importance  
our side is always right ; theirs is always wrong  
in the end , voters are usually forced to choose the lesser of two whocares  
in hollywood the one indisputable inevitable is that if a film makes big money , there will be a sequel  
even if the original story doesn't merit one  
even if the first film is complete in itself  
even if success is a fluke  
 "" the blair witch project "" was made with a budget of $1  75 and exploded on the screen , raking in huge profits  
the concept was brilliant  
the filmmakers created a remarkable buzz that the story might be real  
the film itself was even more convincing  
the movie _must_ be authentic  
why else would such amateurish footage be on the big screen ? 
the first film caught lightning in a bottle  
the sequel proves you can't pour that old lightning into a new bottle  
you have to give this effort some credit  
it would have been easy to have made the same movie again with a new group of kids  
it would have been easy , but of course , it wouldn't have worked  
instead "" book of shadows "" acknowledges the first film as a movie and concentrates on the hysteria following its release  
it's a great scheme and possibly the only entertaining way to do a sequel  
unfortunately it doesn't work either  
five kids spend the night in the woods at the scene of the first film  
weird stuff happens and they retreat to an old factory where one of them lives  
even weirder stuff happens  
some people die , there's blood and knives and none of the characters have a lick of common sense  
while supposedly doing serious research , the group sets up a circle of surveillance cameras in the ruins of the old house in the woods and vows to stay alert all night awaiting a visitation  
then they proceed to get totally trashed on drugs and alcohol and party down with very loud , very obnoxious heavy metal music  
it's a bad plan  
the cast shows some early promise

-1,"synopsis : easily-angered , chainsmoking architect david encounters his homicidal first wife diedre five years after their divorce  
diedre easily cons david's not-so-bright new wife molly into believing she's a child psychologist so that she can influence molly and david's quick-tempered son , michael  
diedre , at the same time , murders a bunch of people  
comments : the ex is a very bad movie  
i haven't seen a turkey of this magnitude in quite a while  
i kept vacillating , however , between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor ( ultimately , i decided to split the difference and give it two stars )  
as summarized briefly in the synopsis , this is yet another spurned-psycho-lover-gets-her-revenge type movie  
i'm not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline , but it seems like 10 , 000 , 000 , 000  
the ex , however , though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre , differs slightly from the norm in that , at least , it doesn't take itself too seriously like so many other duds do ( malicious and stalked are two examples which come to mind )  
those involved in the movie realize they're in a turkey , apparently , and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script  
the ex's storyline , as i said , incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature ; however , the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that , after a while , the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie  
diedre , david's first wife , kills and kills and kills , for example , without ever having to worry about police investigations and the like ( it's not as though she's bright enough not to leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime )  
david and his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why michael , their son , has emotional problems , specifically his inability to control his anger  
though david smokes like tomorrow will never come and blows up at people every other minute in the movie , the connection between him and his son is not made  
molly is easily swayed by diedre into believing she's a child psychologist and allows the demented woman to spend time with her son  
time and time again , things do not add up in this movie  
if a viewer can't accept this fact , then he will definately not like the ex  
if , on the other hand , he can appreciate the movie for its campiness , then he'll probably like it much better  
i don't mean to necessarily suggest , however , that the ex is a memorable exercise in camp  
even when viewed from an it's-so-bad-it's-good angle , this movie isn't all that successful  
the ex does have its moments , though , almost all of which involve yancy butler ( the psychotic diedre ) and nick mancuso ( david )  
these two actors turn in decidedly hammy performances which , oftentimes , elicit chuckles from the audience  
the truly awful lines written for them help this humor along  
butler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue ; every time her character kills someone , she has a punchline that's unbelievably inane  
when she murders a tenant of an apartment she wishes to use to spy on david , for example , diedre whacks the elderly lady with a crowbar and states "" i'm so sorry , your lease is terminated  "" 
or how about when diedre takes out her therapist in another ridiculous scene ? 
 ( diedre's therapist wishes to have her recommitted , so she decides to visit diedre , alone , in her new apartment -- never realizing , of course , that it's not her's  
therapists typically are catatonically brain-dead in these movies )  
having successfully snuffed the woman out , diedre looks at the body and says : "" what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session , dr  jones ? 
oh , that's right  
'i'm sorry , but your time is up ! ' "" 
this is what passes for humor in the film  
the audience doesn't necessarily laugh but groan ( the type of groan that suggests the audience can't believe they're watching this crap -- although watching it they are )  
nick mancuso's chainsmoking , nervous-wreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butler's character delivers , but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief  
in between drags off his cigarette , for instance , in one of the movie's best scenes , david tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his ex-wife is  
in exaggerated exasperation , he nearly shouts "" the woman is a cuckoo-bird ! "" 
 ( trust me , it is funny in context  ) 
and so , the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion  
i won't reveal the ending specifically ( though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film review ) , but i will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film  
molly and david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds ! 
molly , at one point in the film , not-so-brilliantly observes , after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her family's to spy upon them , that "" she's crazy  "" 
you'd be pretty crazy too if you'd rented this turkey  
i'd avoid it unless it's on tv and you come across it "

a dangerous criminal , however , attempts to destroy blade squad after his brother dies while being chased by them  
comments : so , what do an ex-gangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop , a former prostitute with a substance abuse problem , and a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four police cruisers all have in common ? 
why , they're all members of blade squad , an elite new crimefighting unit wearing black uniforms , rollerblades , and jetpacks ! 
they also carry video cameras so they can communicate with one another a la the marines in james cameron's aliens  
yes , it's blade squad , the fox network's wednesday night movie of the week  
this "" movie , "" marking its dubious world premiere today , curiously has a number of guest stars  
 "" how can a movie have guest stars ? "" 
you may ask  
well , blade squad is not really a movie so to speak but a 2 hour pilot for a possible tv series packaged as a movie  
blade squad is dumb  
blade squad is loud  
blade squad is obnoxious  
blade squad will probably be a ratings hit and spawn a long-lived tv series  
why not ? 
after all , television has given its audience crimefighters with talking cars ( "" knight rider "" ) , fast helicopters ( "" airwolf "" ) , and super fast motorcycles ( "" street hawk "" ) , and viewers have eaten it up in the past  
so , why not crimefighters with jet-powered roller blades ? 
to be honest , as a made-for-tv presentation , blade squad is at least watchable  
the film has a relatively large cast of characters , a surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script , and enough action sequences to keep one half-interested  
i'd imagine adolescent males , probably the target audience of this turkey , would get a kick out of it  
i tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad  
i can remember liking "" airwolf "" and "" street hawk "" when i was 10 or 11  
and , although this isn't saying much , blade squad is leaps and bounds better than the last fox network movie i had the displeasure of wasting time on : the insipidly awful generation x ( a huge disappointment considering the comic book's terrific two-year beginning )  
but , i digress  
despite its limited appeal , blade squad has a lot of kinks to work out if the movie is to become a tv series  
one , it suffers from mtv syndrome : a lot of quick shots and weird angles continuously jar the viewer's senses while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the background  
oh yeah , dylan's "" knockin' on heaven's door "" and bowie's "" i'm afraid of americans "" are used here , in rather poor taste  
two , blade squad needs a new crew for the sound  
the substandard sound editing irritated me to no end  
characters' dialogue , at times , sounded choppy and unintelligible  
during one important scene , a song played loudly in the background  
when a character spoke , the song's volume dropped but did not disappear  
as soon as that character finished speaking , the song's volume immediately returned to its original level until the next character spoke  
this sounds trivial , i'm sure , but it distracted me immensely  
finally , this is commercial television  
foul language is not allowed , typically , on commercial television  
thus , don't use foul language in a made-for-tv production because that foul language has to be censored in some manner  
in an early scene of the film , for example , the lead good guy and bad guy have a minor confrontation in the streets  
when the good guy spouts out a bad word , a driver conveniently honks his car's horn off-screen to muffle the word out  
in a "" seinfeld "" episode , this technique proved funny ; here , it seemed goofy and cut the dramatic tension considerably  
perhaps future writers , if a show is spun out of the movie , could take a cue from marvel comics' 2099 series of comics  
make up a bunch of new bad words for the future  
this way , you don't need a bunch of honking horns or other silly devices to cover up foul language  
compared to the usual crap broadcast tv networks have to offer in terms of movies , blade squad is a suitable exercise in camp "

-1,"one of the responses those that enjoy "" detroit rock city "" ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i've given the film might be something like : "" oh , that casey's gone and become a jaded critic on us  
just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n' roll movie like this ? "" 
i'm wondering the same thing  
i feel like i should have had a grand time with "" detroit rock city  "" 
it's the sort of movie i wish i could've had a lot of fun with , but i didn't  
i just didn't  
surely this film isn't trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? 
no , but i expected something  
a funny joke  
a clever prank  
a plot development  
anything  
the movie never delivers  
you've got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing  
 "" detroit rock city "" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film's existence , and it's not a very satisfying realization  
the film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan  
that's it  
there is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot  
the characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington )  
they have a garage band  
they're pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n' roll , so i guess that means we root for them  
they have tickets , they lose them  
they get more tickets , they lose those too  
they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire  
there's not much more to it  
frankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity  
oh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency  
she doesn't want them to see kiss , if you hadn't figured that out already  
it's really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this  
we've got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy  
then again , "" maximum overdrive "" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time  
 "" detroit rock city "" doesn't quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close  
in fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind  
basically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc's "" highway to hell "" sounds like something my neighbor's cat coughed up )  
it's also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it' s evident that they're all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie  
edward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they've got to make a living in hollywood  
people wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song  
too bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess  
director adam rifkin knows he hasn't got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning  
we get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script  
it's fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting "
-1,"weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg's reliance on formulas , _saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches  
there ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics  
spielberg's greatest strength as a director is the polished , formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story  
but for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war ( or the holocaust ) this technique backfires , for it creates coherent , comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size , complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken  
in this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films  
_saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a "" pr mission "" to pull a young man , ryan ( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere ) out of combat on the normandy front just after d-day  
ryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers  
the search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france  
there's no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie  
the equipment , uniforms and weapons are superbly done  
the opening sequence , in which captain miller ( tom hanks ) leads his men onto omaha beach , is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat  
another pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg's brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences , such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers , the banality of death in combat , the routine foul-ups in the execution of the war , and the cynicism of the troops  
the technical side of the film is peerless , as always  
the camera work is magnificent , the pacing perfect , the sets convincing , the directing without flaw  
hanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance , which was utterly convincing , and the supporting cast was excellent , though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel  
yet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events  
it has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film , or the story fails to convince  
throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to death with relative frequency )  
for example , we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground  
here and there men lose limbs ; in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety , there's an explosion , and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man  
but the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact  
there are no shoes with only feet in them , no limbs scattered everywhere , no torsos without limbs , no charred corpses , and most importantly , all corpses have heads ( in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds )  
the relentless dehumanization of the war , in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity , is soft-pedaled in the film  
ultimately , _saving private ryan_ bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war  
rather than saying _saving private ryan_ is "" realistic , "" it would be better to describe it as "" having realistic moments  "" 
another aspect of the "" hollywoodization "" of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular , the lack of swearing  
anyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war , such as fussell's superb _wartime : understanding and behavior in the second world war_ ( which has an extensive discussion on swearing ) , knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup  
 "" who is this private ryan that we have to die for him ? "" 
asks one infantrymen in the group of eight  
rendered in wartime demotic , that should have been expressed as "" who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him ? "" 
or some variant thereof  
conversations should have been literally sprinkled with the "" f "" word , and largely about ( the search for ) food and sex  
this is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an "" r "" rating due to violence , so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film  
however , the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic  
the most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg  
he cannot just cede control to the material ; he has to be bigger than it  
as if afraid to let the viewer find their own ( perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear ) emotional foothold in the material , spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had : the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary ( reminscent of the closing scene from _schindler's list ) , the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close ( every bit as bad as schindler's monologue about how his car , tiepin or ring could have saved another jew ) , quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson , captain miller's last words to private ryan , and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain  
that particular subplot is so hokey , so predictable , it nigh on ruins the film  
nowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness , stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat ( imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage )  
because of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii , _saving private ryan_ can only pan for small truths in the shallows

-1,"pre-review note : seeing as the only concern of body shots is "" sex "" , i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review  
because of this , i will try to vary word descriptions of "" sex "" ( meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms , and \ or your name is jerry falwell , you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen ) , so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend , fret not , it's most likely just another way of referring to "" sex ""  
i think we'd all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review  
though not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what  
body shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously , in the way you'd normally expect to see a violent attack  
it's about people who think about screwing , seek it out , and talk about it  
these are things we all do , sometimes  
the characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts  
their lives center around the next sexual encounter , but they seemed depressed  
it's as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek  
at its core body shots is a message movie , the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition  
michael cristoffer ( who directed gia , another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil ) is a moralist with nothing new to say  
his characters don't communicate anything of interest to each other , so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera  
they voice simplistic platitudes like "" i like to come "" or "" sex without love equals violence ""  
huh ? 
and yes that is as complex as this movie's observations get  
the characters are stupid and shallow , with not one registering as anything more  
the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure , then the after math ( the morning after ) of such events  
we meet the characters as they speak directly to us , confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy  
i would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them , giving you the pros and cons , but for this film i cannot  
i'm not trying to be clever or witty , but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others  
with the exception of trent ( played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman ) , the rest fade into each other-- a patchwork of fake breasts , defined abs , pearly white teeth , and creamy , flawless skin  
i vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one , only because his character gets the worst lines ( "" sex without love equals violence "" )  
in between all the confessionals , cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial , with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning  
the fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me  
this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining  
if body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f * * k-obsessed , fine , i don't have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way , but cristoffer only gives us one side  
additionally that one side isn't even entertaining ; the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness  
or realism  
one sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters  
they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason ( other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other ? ? ? alas , if it could only be that easy ? ? ? kidding of course ) , then , not only isn't it erotic , it isn't real  
it doesn't feel like an authentic sexual encounter  
every f * * k scene in this film ( and there are many ) is treated in the same unsexy manner  
body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film  
it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it , and most of all , it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it  
the resulting search for nookie ( and you can take that cookie ? ? ? ) over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow  
the main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred  
the film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape ( one where it is consensual the other where it is not ) and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off  
this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently , and if memory serves me i can't think of one film that has done so , and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80's next to wall street  
unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care , not the writer , the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off "

-1,"after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy , i was ready for some mindless fun--oh , maybe something like tango & cash  
maybe not ! 
mindless fun is one thing , but brain-dead slop is another matter altogether  
tango & cash has "" lowest common denominator "" written all over it  
the movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l  a  russell plays cash , a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts  
stallone plays tango , a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it ; he doesn't need the money  
in an effort to change his image , stallone goes for a yuppie , gq look in the film , wearing spectacles and three piece suits  
the two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names  
tango & cash is unbearably noisy  
for starters , there's harold faltermeyer's annoying synthesized score , which gets old after four notes  
to make matters worse , the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars , the more the merrier  
in fact , the movie begins with not one but two car chases  
there's nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie  
screenwriter randy feldman's brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv  
his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it , such as stallone's efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual  
in a movie with the iq level of an amoeba , even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent--and stallone is no lawrence olivier  
it's hard to imagine anyone reading feldman's script and thinking , "" i want to be in this movie  "" 
the film's plot doesn't have one original bone in its body , and--again--you have to point your finger at the screenwriting  
feldman's story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book , making tango & cash altogether generic and predictable  
they simply could have called it "" action movie  "" 
every character , every twist and turn , is stolen from television or from other movies  
adding insult to injury , tango & cash is about as believable as a "" road runner "" cartoon  
action movies don't have to be realistic , but they should absorb you enough so that you're not thinking about the lack of realism  
the only artistic aspect of tango & cash is the cinematography  
there are some spectacular shots , especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires  
the film's main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell  
unfortunately , their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants  
the dialogue consists of nothing but one-liners , and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing  
it's a shame because with a workable screenplay , russell and stallone could have turned tango & cash into a charming "" lethal weaponesque "" adventure  
tango & cash tries to maintain a light tone , and you do laugh about once every five minutes  
seeing russell in drag is the movie's funniest moment , but you probably already have seen it in the commercials  
furthermore , the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence  
machine guns and torture generally don't mix well with comedy  
jack palance appears in tango & cash doing what he does best : playing a sleazy , conniving villain  
his character , however , is run-of-the-mill , except for his strange obsession with mice  
like many movie villains , palance likes to play games  
in fact , he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash , a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room  
you have to wonder why palance doesn't just shoot the detectives in the head ! 
the story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent "
-1,"ex-universal soldier luc has to battle a group of newer-model engineered fighters gone bad  
the review 
jean-claude van damme has a one-liner early on in universal soldier : the return , his latest attempt to remain relevant , that sums up this entire movie ; he says "" been there , done that  "" 
no film critic could possibly sum up van damme's recent film choices any better  
while other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres ( schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films ) , van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him : martial arts and guns  
this unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world , with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex  
he joins fellow martial artist/action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away  
universal soldier : the return is truly poor  
the plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade , specifically terminator 2 : judgement day and the similarly named soldier  
soldier's kurt russell was an older model super-soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors , for the good of a planet ; schwarzenegger's terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine , the t-1000 ; and jean-claude , a former universal soldier , has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of , you guessed it , newer model soldiers  
considering the poor box office performance of soldier , it's amazing that this project was ever given the go-ahead  
luc devereaux ( van damme ) was the sole remaining universal soldier ( or unisol for short ) , until he was returned to a normal , if muscular , human form  
in this sequel ( technically the fourth film in the series , following two straight-to-video duds that were ignored here plot-wise ) , luc is now a human trainer/consultant of sorts for the unisol program  
working with dylan cotner ( xander berkeley , who interestingly also appeared in t2 ) , the unisol program has engineered a tougher , fiercer fighting force with the help of super-computer seth  
unfortunately , upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government , seth takes control of his soldiers , killing everyone in the building except for luc , his partner maggie , his daughter hillary and erin , a reporter trapped inside  
the rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive , while beating up a group of near-indestructible soldiers , most notably romeo ( popular wrestler goldberg )  
there are lots of fights , gun battles , lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility  
there are so many clich ? s in this film that it is almost painful to watch  
luc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on , and in the course of a single night , they go from bickering to falling for each other , to kissing  
erin is a pathetically-written character ; people are getting brutally gunned down all around her , and yet , not only does this not seem to frighten her , but she finds time to remind luc that she "" isn't leaving without her story ""  
whatever  
other laughable moments include a ) luc going to a strip club to get internet access ( what ? ) and b ) a group of rangers , who after having been given good advice ( luc tells them that their weapons are useless , and shows them a specific gun which should work better ) , choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway ( guess who wins the battle ? )  
not one single scene in universal soldier : the return has any originality to it  
when fuelled by don davis' loud , driving music score , the film's many fights become almost passable , but mostly are full of the same ol' jean-claude moves  
director mic rodgers ( a former stunt co-ordinator ) keeps the action coming at a rapid pace , with only a few token serious moments to be found  
his past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows , tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion  
if only jean-claude weren't getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li , rodgers could probably have made a decent action film  
to place the blame squarely at van damme's feet , however , is an injustice  
i'm not sure that anyone , not even robert deniro or edward norton , could make writers william malone and john fasano's script sound good  
one particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access  
he cringes , looks down and mutters "" uh    uhm    
they all do , i saw it on 60 minutes  
eh he he he "" the script's and indeed the entire film's only saving grace is goldberg  
he chews up every scene he is in , obviously enjoying his role immensely  
he even gives the film a few laughs , as he mutters things like "" i really don't like that guy "" every time he fails to kill luc "

yes , despite being a third sequel to a successful original movie , the latest highlander doesn't seem to have anything going for it  
oh stinky movie , let me count thee ways    
plot : ( from what i understood ) a really bad highlander dude comes to the present looking to whack out the nice highlander dudes in order to gain their power and become the mightiest immortal    or 
something along those lines  
critique : a complete and utter mess  
disjointed , incoherent , boring , corny , filled with bad dialogue    and 
that's just the first thirty minutes ! 
this film doesn't seem to know what to do with itself  
it's confusing to anyone who doesn't know the series ( i include myself in that group ) and apparently idiotic to those who do know the series ( i include die-hard highlander fan the arrow in that group )  
the film doesn't explain anything about itself    it 
just goes from one inexplicable situation to another  
one moment they're in the present time , the next moment , they're in italy in the 1600s  
why ? 
who knows  
what are they talking about ? 
no idea  
flashbacks mixed in with the present , mixed in with a few spontaneously cheesy fight sequences every now and again , and i even remember seeing one flashback scene which went even further into its own flashback scene ! ! 
hullo    ? ! ? 
confused yet ? 
i was and i basically stopped giving a crap about anyone in the film when i realized that neither the writer or director was interested in presenting me with any kind of semblance of a story  
random swordplay , mad max-like dudes showing up in motorcycles in the 1800s ? 
or were they in the present at that time ? 
who knows    and to be honest    who 
seriously cares ! 
this series should have been shot in the head and put out of its own misery a long time ago , but sadly , someone at the studio decided that it still had a little life left in it  
please , please    for the love of god and all that is holy in the world of movie-making , and mostly out of respect for those who loved the original film , put this series to bed and end it ! 
even christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle to adrian paul in this one  
the director also tries to do the best he can with the muddled material , but all he could come up with is plenty of slo-mo action , some fast-motion fight scenes and lots of smoke everywhere  
and is there anything spectacular about the sword-play or fight scenes ? 
nope "

-1,"i've always been a kevin kline fan , silverado , fish called wanda , pirates of penzance , and even his hamlet on pbs' great performances  
the minute i saw the trailer for this film , i resolved to see it  
besides the fact that kline starred , it looked like a hilarious film  
i got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent , however , as i also thought , "" wow , if there's this much funny stuff in the trailer , there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film  "" 
 ( oops ) i packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo ( my name for our local multi-multi-plex  ) 
the film began     
the film concerns an english/drama teacher at a suburban high school , named howard brackett  
he loves poetry and great literary works , but his class is more interested in his famous former student , played by matt dillon  
 ( i'd put in his name , but my wife won't let me take notes during a movie and i've forgotten it  ) 
they continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him  
brackett has been engaged to another teacher ( played by joan cusack ) for three years , and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her  
the wedding , however , becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual  
kline spends most of the first two-thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn't  
the whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference  
his closest friends don't help matters , bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party  
there are some genuinely hilarous moments , one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity  
kline is hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck , who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out , while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations  
the movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding  
kline stands at the altar and is asked to take his vows    
if you want to be surprised , don't read , i am going to reveal the ending  
    instead of saying "" i do "" in front of his parents and most of the town , and even some cameras , he says "" i'm gay  "" 
this is where the movie , in my opinion falls apart  
most of the humor in the film had come from kline's insistence that he was straight , while at the same time , loving poetry and being a senstivie guy , dressing well , and occaisionally acting prissy  
it reminded me of the "" effeminate heterosexual "" sketch from saturday night live  
it was funny , it was sustainably funny , and kline's performance made it doubly so  
however , after the wedding , the film drags on  
they should have attempted to come to a quick conclusion , but it then gets into the serious side of what he's done  
he reconciles with his parents and his friends , some of which had turned on him  
there are several scenes which seemed like a waste of time , the scene with his mother and her friends , which was hilarious , seemed pointless , and the scene with tom selleck in the bar with joan seemed pointless  
finally , even though i am not catholic , i found the scene with the priest to be condescending  
the preist cannot believe that a man was engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship , proclaiming to brackett in the third person , "" he's gay "

-1,"an 80-year old woman jumps enthusiastically on her couch , wearing tight-fitting leather , as she cheers on her favorite tv wrestler by calling his opponent a `pump-bitch'  
two men messily eat fast food as their septic truck leaks raw sewage directly behind them  
and roughly 17 people are booted in the crotch  
welcome to `ready to rumble'  
judging from the fact that potty-mouth adam sandler is the reigning box-office comedy champion , you realize -- albeit while shaking your head -- that yes , there is an audience for this sort of thing  
ladies and gentlemen , i weep for society  
mind you , when executed with style and comic ingenuity , jokes like an alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel ( `there's something about mary' ) and a laxative-induced attack of explosive diarrhea ( `dumb and dumber' ) can be extremely funny  
unfortunately , `ready to rumble' is not being helmed by the farrelly brothers , nor is it bolstered by a script that accommodates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or inspired  
`ready to rumble' is built around the dedicated fan-base of professional wrestling     
which , in fact , sounded like a fine concept for a goofball comedy  
but director brian robbins and screenwriter steven brill handcuff themselves , and limited to a stampede of asinine , humdrum bathroom humor , basically the only thing they manage is to evoke memories of pauly shore and `bio dome'  
gordie boggs ( david arquette ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) take pride in being hardcore wcw wrestling fanatics  
by day , they transport raw sewage  
by night ( particularly on ? nitro' monday ) , they pay homage to their personal hero and savior - jimmy king ( oliver platt ) , the undisputed leader of the professional wrestling community  
with two tickets to an upcoming nitro performance , gordie and sean are psyched about witnessing the king defend his title first-hand  
but unscrupulous boxing kingpin titus sinclair ( joe pantoliano , sporting long hair and cowboy boots ) has other plans  
sinclair is plotting to have diamond dallas page ( playing himself ) pummel the king into the tarp , thereby dethroning the dignified wrestler and embarrassing him in front of a bewildered auditorium full of fans  
gordie and sean are shocked , rioting madly while arguing `this isn't even a pay-per view event ! ! ' 
they take it upon themselves to track the king down and supply the encouragement essential for their fallen idol to make a come-back attempt  
along the way , you can expect a lot of sh-- jokes as well  
you may find something to like in `ready to rumble' if a ) you are a rasslin' aficionado yourself , or b ) you are a dedicated fan of the lowest of low-brow comedies  
i welcome low-brow humor with open arms - that is , if its fresh and resourceful  
`rumble' is nothing but a sloppy , frightfully unfunny swamp land of misbegotten retardation  
the first half-hour is the ultimate test of patience  
luckily , the simple-minded events pick up steam , particularly with the well-choreographed wrestling action  
director robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality and excitement of football in `varsity blues' , and when in the ring , he does professional work  
but the violence is too excessive  
having the fake soap opera of wcw wrestling turn into a bloody skirmish brings back unfortunate memories of owen hart's tragic accident just last year , especially with one character's dive during a cage match  
this is not something you want a comedy to be reminiscent of  
outside the wrestling action , the lewd jokes and puerile sight gags bring new meaning to the term ? scattershot' , while the dialogue fluctuates in on the vulgarity scale of 1 to 10 , with brill's extensive vocabulary ranging from `diddly' to `boob' and so on  
the final tally : i chuckled a few times , groaned a lot , and indulged in one spirited belly laugh involving martin landau as a geriatric wrestling coach who fights pretty impressively for 105  
casting-wise , `ready to rumble' is an odd duck  
oliver platt as a champion wrestling figure ? 
he's perhaps a bit chunky , but fellow wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him `fatty' , which dampens the blow i suppose  
rose mcgowan is fully disposable as a sultry wcw cheerleader ( `the nirto-est of the nitro girls , ' proclaims gordie ) , but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers goldberg , `macho man' randy savage and sting ( among others )  
wcw fans are sure to appreciate these

-1,"this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney's live- action george of the jungle  
tarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough's legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far  
badly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves  
i have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie  
furthermore , it's even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence  
and , while i'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production  
of course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film's troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line  
imagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like  
with its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse  
anyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect  
the only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors )  
the film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough  
instead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a  k  a  john clayton a  k  a  tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march )  
he is living happily in england , enjoying the benefits of being a land-owning noble  
meanwhile , in central africa , the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington ) , a self-proclaimed scholar and explorer , believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar , which he calls the cradle of civilization  
on the way there , he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things , like burning native villages , to earn the wrath of the locals  
one shaman , determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal , sends a mystical message to tarzan for help  
with lady jane following close behind , he returns to the jungle where he was born  
its patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty-boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability  
with his plastic facial expressions , monotone voice , and complete inability to make convincing animal noises , his range rivals that of steven seagal  
his pecs , however , are impressive , and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off  
jane march , on the other hand , has to keep her shirt on , which may be a first for her  
some six years ago , march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud's steamy the lover  
since then , she made the career-killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night , which exploited her every acting defiency  
tarzan continues this trend  
march may be attractive , but , at least judging by this performance , she can't act  
meanwhile , steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy  
instead , he turns out to be little more than a nuisance  
the story line is pure formula , which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies  
the problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless  
the romantic elements are all contrived ? in fact , lady jane's presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance  
the special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel ( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes ? apparently , animatronics were too expensive for this production )  
and , of course , as with all jungle movies , there are the obligatory cute animals "
-1,"do the folks at disney have no common decency ? 
they have resurrected yet another cartoon and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects , embarrassing writing and kid-friendly slapstick  
wasn't mr  magoo enough , people ? 
obviously not  
inspector gadget is not what i would call ideal family entertainment  
younger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding goofiness , but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80-minute exercise in glaring stupidity  
the movie is poorly edited , grossly manipulative , and the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle  
all the elements are there , but the manner in which director david kellogg pieces them together is laughable and trite  
as a huge fan of the 80's animated tv show , the first thing i must express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain  
in the cartoon , dr  claw was a frightening , raspy-voiced presence who remained a total mystery to the viewer  
we never saw his face ; he simply sat back in his arm-chair , watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his loyal cat  
as a child , i always imagined what dr  claw would appear as - and this curiosity kept me watching for many years  
with the release of the live-action movie , the face of this once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed - it's    
rupert everett ? ! 
only now , dr  claw is simply known as claw ( `one word , ' he explains , `like madonna' )  
he sports a shiny clamp instead of the steel glove , and seems far less interesting than the animated version  
it helps that the dashing everett is enthusiastic , but he overplays the role entirely too far  
when all is said and done , this wasn't a very wise move on the part of the screenwriters - the infamous dr  claw has been turned into a wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and cool  
he does still have his cat , though  
in the title role , matthew broderick looks lost  
the actor , while usually downright charming , doesn't know exactly where to take his character - a fault that again can be blamed on the hapless writers  
broderick first plays a friendly , naive security guard named john brown , who dreams of becoming a cop and upholding the law for the good of the people  
he has a mad crush on pretty scientist brenda ( joely fisher ) , who has stumbled upon a new wave of technology involving the interaction of human tissue and electronics  
but one fateful night , her lab is destroyed and her experiment is stolen by a fiendish millionaire ( everett ) who wants to take over the world  
john courageously pursues the limousine from the scene of the crime , but loses the chase when his vehicle bursts into flames  
in a full body cast , he is chosen to be the first human prototype for brenda's work ; a revolutionary crime fighting tool with numerous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys  
and so is born inspector gadget  
as bad as this movie is , it does have a certain charm in isolated scenes  
broderick actually fares better playing robo gadget , an evil and destructive clone that claw has set loose on the city  
and there are about two or three amusing punch lines , the funniest being when robo gadget impersonates a rampaging monster with shadow puppets on a brick wall , and a japanese man flees the scene while screaming , `this is why i left tokyo ! ' 
alas , the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to 1 in favor of not even cracking a slight giggle  
there are so many tired plot additions  
gadget's talking car ( voiced by d  l  
hughley ) is the same type of character as zoot the suit from my favorite martian  
both are wisecracking , non-human additions designed to coax laughter from smaller children "
-1,"as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment , hollywood doesn't loose the oppertunity to get involved , by telling stories and expressing opinions  
this film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels , hays hodges ( tommy lee jones ) and terry childers ( samuel l  jackson )  
they fought side by side in vietnam , where childers saved hodges' life by shooting an unarmed pow  
that's against the rules of war but understandable , in this story anyway , under the specific circumstances  
certainly hodges is not complaining  
years pass  
hodges , whose wounds make him unfit for action , gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer  
childers , is now a respected and much-decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould  
because of his excellent record , childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ( ben kingsley ) , cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops  
childers does what he has to do : evacuate the family and protect the men under his command  
after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire , he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd  
more than 80 yemeni men , women , and children are mowed down  
childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians  
he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film  
did childers violate authorized u  s  military rules of engagement ? 
or are there simply no rules in war ? 
the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious , but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions  
the murder of 83 "" innocent civilians "" has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u  s  where is the accusations from the arab leaders ? 
where is the u  n  ? 
the film ends without even telling the most interesting story : what happens on the international arena ? 
this film ( in a way akin to films such as "" a few good men "" ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism  
these accusations are pretty heavy , but also unfair  
what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking  
one of the earliest apparent problems with 'rules of engagement' is its lack of credibility  
the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now , but is overdone , contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed  
a lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality  
that is precisely why it's not offensive  
it is completely unobjective  
many stories are started and never finished  
many questions are asked , but never answered  
a lot of parallels are referring to nothing  
it seems that neither the director , producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film  
is it about arab mentality ? 
america's foreign policies ? 
america's role in the world ? 
corruption in the higher circles ? 
it goes on and on  
it consists of countless stories , but not a definable plot  
it tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one  
i think that it is ironic , because director william friedkin's probably most acclaimed film was "" the exorcist "" which had a silly story , but became a rather effective film  
in this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film "

it's also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year  
i figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998 , but alas , it has already been found  
jean-claude van damme stars as ( i think ) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half-brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods  
rob schneider plays van damme's partner , and rochon plays    
actually , i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be  
she just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there  
many things are not explained in this film , but i do know that for some bizarre reason , van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick  
where chan comes off as endearing in his "" normal guy "" character seen in many of his films , van damme just comes off as a wimp  
we're never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions  
to be more clear : i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie , and even then , it was not made too clear  
the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong  
tsui hark ( who directed van damme's last movie , the bad , but not nearly as bad as this , "" double team "" ) never lets the camera rest for a second , and that's no exaggeration  
we are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme's foot entering a shoe  
fabulous ! 
seriously , though , i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions , as long as they don't get carried away  
for example , look at sam raimi  
 "" army of darkness "" , one of his best movies , features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen , but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story  
that's a concept that tsui can't seem to grasp  
the special effects and outrageous camera angles * rule * "" knock off "" to the point where the audience doesn't have a clue as to what's happening any more  
another problem with the film is that it looks cheap  
the film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night  
and for some inexplicable reason , everyone's voice seems to have been dubbed  
even the stars  
and even the special effects , seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about , are inconsistent  
for example , there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window  
the car slams into the ground , and the left wheel is completely destroyed  
seconds later , the car drives off at full speed  
hey , i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie , but a line must be drawn somewhere  
finally , the acting  
nobody gives a good performance in this film  
van damme , an actor i usually like , is way off the mark playing "" everyman ""  
and schneider , here to provide comic relief i assume , is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene  
even the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over-the-top performance as    
once again , i have no idea who he was supposed to be  
in case i haven't yet made it clear enough , "" knock off "" is the worst movie of van damme's career and possibly the worst movie of the decade "

every year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular , and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights , wallets in hand

you add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds , and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes , the typical teenage attention span  
the response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any = film set in an environment they can relate to , and , most importantly , they don92t care to judge films=92 quality , so any piece of trash will = due

josie geller ( drew barrymore ) is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times  
she has her own personal assistant , unlimited supplies , and her own office  
but she is very much dismayed with her position in life  
there is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field , where she can play a more active role in the chicago media  
so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere , she jumps at it with elation  
constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita ( molly shannon ) and her amicable superior , gus ( john c  reilly )  
the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment , as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter  
however , since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict , this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes , and josie is headed for the field  
obviously , the field assignment involves a high school  
specifically , she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school , by enrolling in the senior class and "" becoming one of them  "" 
i don92t think that i = need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring , so i won92t  
the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school  
interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was , and she appears to be heading down that road again  
fortunately for this lame production , other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting  
they include the predictable love stories , between both a student ( jeremy jordan ) and a teacher ( michael vartan ) , to show that josie is really two people in one body  
also , her younger brother and opposite , rob ( david arquette ) comes into her new found life and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative  
the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing  
typical for teenage films , it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor  
one scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical  
most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy  
but those still don92t = recover for the total lack of quality in this movie  
following this trend of high school movie rules , comes the general acting  
it is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film  
in this case , drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch  
she is required to play her character on two levels , having some very black and white transitions  
and although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray , she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time  
at one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel , and is expected to him on an adult level , since he is one , her teacher  
but she never seems to get out of the gray area , and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good performance  
following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon ( saturday night live )  
she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to , and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic  
it is these "" qualities "" that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent  
luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film "

-1,"well , what are you going to expect ? 
it's a movie about a big snake that eats people  
that's what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film , because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more  
instead , i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me , too  
anaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river  
led by anthropologists dr  steven cale ( eric stolz ) and terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives  
along the way , they find poacher paul sarone ( jon voight ) , and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda  
to simply say that this is the world's largest snake wouldn't be doing it justice , since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide  
if this isn't a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers , i don't know what is  
at the beginning of anaconda , we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past , but that seems to be more or less over now  
i expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line , but it ended up being a set-up for nothing  
cale chokes on a deadly wasp ( don't ask me how that happens - i don't know ) and is put out of action , relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help  
this minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot , since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone's plan to capture the snake  
however , this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film , and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle  
most bad characters are either annoying or stupid  
in this movie , they're both  
since this description applies to all the characters except sarone , it's hard to find someone to root for  
you're supposed to back the good guys , but you really end up cheering for sarone because he's smarter than everyone else  
or maybe he's just not as dumb as everyone else  
at times , i almost found myself rooting for the snake  
there are no standout performances here  
everyone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters  
even voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason  
no matter , as in most monster movies , the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway  
in most of the scenes , the snake is computer generated , and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real  
however , the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences  
sometimes , for example , the snake just moves too fast  
it catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall , for crying out loud  
then there's another scene where the snake eats one of the characters , and we see the snake's skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim's pained expression from within the snake's belly  
absolutely ridiculous  
a testimony to the film's bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film , where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is  
in a scene totally unrelated to anything else , we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther  
the anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard , one of the panther's eyeballs pops out  
eeeewwwww  
above and beyond the sick factor , however , this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed  
in films like these , a sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained  
if the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see , we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them  
to show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don't know about , and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown  
in a case like that , the showdown just ends up being a letdown "

if that were true , i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads : "" shay casey : seeing bad movies so you don't have to  "" 
but i know that's bunk-you're going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say  
so i have to tell the truth : every once in a while i get a nasty , masochistic urge to see a bad movie  
you know the feeling , when you're sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly  
sometimes i think that's why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies , ever  
admit it : sometimes you like seeing bad movies  
so do i  
so i saw "" supernova  "" 
truth be told , "" supernova "" wasn't quite as bad as i thought it might be  
maybe i just felt sorry for the actors , or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn't started tinkering with the director's ( walter hill ) final cut , causing him to want his name removed  
maybe i'm becoming a softy  
in any case , i didn't find "" supernova "" as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe  
but it's still bad  
the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel "" nightingale  "" 
the crew includes captain a  j  
marley ( robert forster ) , his new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) and danika lund ( robin tunney ) , and computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz )  
there are some attempts at "" characterization , "" but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female )  
don't expect any more explanation , because you won't get it  
anyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent  
during the dimension jump ( i think that's what it's called , but don't hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board  
he calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with  
then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening  
have you seen "" alien ? "" 
have you seen "" event horizon "" ( a lame movie in its own right ) ? 
good  
then you've seen "" supernova  "" 
post-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either  
after all , no one's going to think for a second that troy won't turn out to be a villain  
but the bigger problem with "" supernova "" is that it can' t just stick to the simple plot it's afforded  
numerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it's a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped  
was there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ? 
did the ship's computer learn something about humanity ? 
what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ? 
and just what does the film's title signify , if anything ? 
as far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn't developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements  
character relationships in this film also make very little sense  
for some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex  
we get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes  
bassett and spader's characters start off hating each other  
fifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they're engaging in some hanky-panky  
when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him  
every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut  
the most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits ! 
furthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits "

in the early to mid 1400's , there was little in the way of spiritual light to be found shining from the heart of a man or woman  
the church was a dismally dark and oppressive place  
france was involved in "" the hundred years war "" against england  
there was no strong political leadership in the country  
morale was low , there being little hope for the future  
it was within this setting that a young french girl began hearing "" voices "" and seeing "" visions  "" 
convinced that these were messages from god , she brazenly demanded to see the dauphin in order to deliver the message directly to him  
the message : if he would give her an army to command , she would deliver to him the crown  
he does    
and she does  
then , once seated on the throne , he abandons her to her english captors  
director luc besson ( the fifth element ) may have co-wrote the script but he never appeared to have a proper handle on the material  
the inconsistencies of the cast , the confusing blur of the violent battle scenes , the inappropriate musical score , and the lack of a vibrant life force at the center of the film adds up to a largely disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable  
his biggest miscue was to cast his wife , milla jovovich ( the fifth element ) in the title role  
ms  jovovich , looks spectacular as joan , clad in battle armor , astride a similarly protected horse  
if looks were enough to fully convey a character , she would have been brilliant  
since it isn't , she tried ( and failed ) to act the part  
her joan is unbalanced , "" inspiring "" the troops merely by screaming stridently and waving her banner or sword over her head like a woman possessed  
john malkovich ( being john malkovich ) fares a bit better as the dauphin , who joan would see on the throne as charles vii  
an easily manipulated man , his weakness of character foreshadows the betrayal of joan which would lead to her death  
faye dunaway ( the thomas crown affair ) gives a strong performance in minimal screen time as the dauphin's mother-in-law and chief advisor  
the army under joan's command are comprised of comical figures , more stooges than soldiers  
the one exception would be tcheky karyo ( la femme nikita ) as dunois , the man who was leading the attack prior to joan's arrival  
trying to plan a systematic campaign , he sees his leadership authority negated by joan's insistence on following her "" visions  ""

-1,"i think that saying that the x-files is one of this summer's most anticipated films is safe  
for five years , "" the x-files "" television show has developed a dedicated fan culture , whose rabid devotion to the series rivals that of "" star trek "" fans  
the premise of both the movie and the television series is two fbi agents who investigate the paranormal ; fox mulder ( david duchovny ) is the avid believer whose quest to find the truth about extraterrestrial life borders on the paranoid , and dana scully ( gillian anderson ) is the scientific skeptic trying to find a rational explanation to mulder's flights of fancy  
outlining the plot of the x-files movie is virtually impossible , since to be general would result in confusion , yet to be specific would give too much away  
nevertheless , i will try  
 "" the black ooze , "" and extraterrestrial , virus-like substance is threatening earth  
a "" shadow government "" is aware of this , but tries to cover-up the alien existence  
mulder and scully know "" the truth is out there , "" and so try to expose both the invasion and the cover-up  
there are three central questions i have heard asked about this movie : 1  
will those who don't watch the series be able to understand the movie ? 
yes  
isolated as an individual text , the x-files can stand alone  
they have given enough background for anyone , familiar with the show or not , to understand the movie  
although some of the secondary characters' histories may confuse the uninitiated , those characters are not essential to the film  
this is a major problem : they trot out token secondary characters from the series out for an appearance and then disappear just as quickly  
why bring superintendent skinner into the picture in the first place , and then have him sat silently on an fbi internal affairs committee ? 
why bring in "" the lone gunmen , "" three computer geek conspiracy theorists , for an even briefer appearance ? 
these characters are recurrent on the series , and their appearance in the film was met with whoops from the audience ( suggesting their popularity among fans - actually most of the audience could pass for "" the lone gunmen "" )  
still , then they vanish just as quickly  
2  the television show never gives us any answers  
will the movie actually explain some things ? 
yes  
in the x-files we get a fairly complete history of "" the black ooze , "" what it is and what it wants  
we finally get some understanding of the motivations behind the "" shadow government  "" 
there are even some subtle tie-ins with contemporary ufo-ology , including the "" greys "" and the roswell crash of 1947  
3  is the movie any good ? 
no  the x-files is a dreadful movie and shows some fundamental problems with writer/creator chris carter's talents and the relationship between cinema and television  
first off , the screenplay by series creator chris carter is sloppy and cliched  
after approximately forty-five minutes ( the length of a television episode minus the commercials ) , the pace drops to a snail's crawl  
not long after that point , when carter attempts to answer some questions we have had about the series , we wish he had not  
the explanations are so trite and ridiculous that one would have preferred it had carter not explained quite so much  
i am willing to suspend my disbelief a fair bit , but the absurdity carter wants me to swallow was just too much  
breaking the suspension of disbelief destroys the movie - and listening to other fans leave the cinema , maybe the series too  
the explanations are not only absurd , they are tired and unoriginal  
the extraterrestrials breed and gestate like those from the alien series , and their craft looks like a leftover set piece from independence day  
note that the alien movies , id4 , and the x-files are all from 20thcentury fox - a studio that is beginning to cannibalize itself i think  
the x-files is noteworthy for being the only movie based on a television series to be produced while the series was still running  
in comparing the movie and television series certain aspects of the respective media emerge  
the avoidance of the series to answer the questions it raised annoyed and frustrated many people  
however , i rather liked that about the series  
television allows you to impose as much , or as little , meaning on a show as you want "

us distribution : 20th century fox rated pg : mild violence , thematic elements 
copyright 1999 nathaniel r  atcheson 
a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review  
i've attempted to obey this rule in recent months , but to do so would be impossible in this case  
the fact is , nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them  
the original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people  
for me , they calibrated my creativity as a child ; they are masterful , original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time ( and they still hold up pretty darn well )  
i am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release , but that doesn't make me any less dedicated to it  
on the contrary , the star wars trilogy -- and the empire strikes back in particular -- are three items on a very short list of why i love movies  
when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine-film series , i got exited  
when i first saw screenshots from the film , well over a year ago , i embarked on a year-long drool of anticipation  
and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving , i was ready to see the film  
but then there was the hype , the insane marketing campaign , and lucasfilm's secretive snobbery over the picture  
in the last weeks before the picture opened , while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater , i was tired of hearing about it  
i was tired of seeing cardboard cut-outs of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell  
i just wanted to see the movie  
reader , do not misunderstand  
i did not have an anti-hype reaction  
the hype was unavoidable  
i understand and accept the hype -- it's just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released  
five minutes into the phantom menace , i knew there was a problem  
 "" who are these jedi knights ? "" 
i asked  
 "" why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine-gun rapidity ? "" 
 "" why aren't these characters being developed before their adventures ? "" 
 "" why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film ? "" 
these were just some of my questions early on  
later , i asked , "" where's the magic of the first three films ? "" 
and "" why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes ? ' 
by the end of the film , i was tired , maddened , and depressed  
george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless , mindless , summer blockbuster  
the phantom menace is no star wars film  
take away the title and the jedi talk and the force , and you're left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time  
it's an embarrassment  
i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored , or a new theme is examined , or a special effects shot isn't used  
there are a few of each , but they're all token attempts  
the fact is , george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects  
this is not what i wanted to see  
i didn't want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth , but i did  
the story centers mostly around qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson , looking lost and confused ) and his apprentice , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor , who scarcely has a line in the film ) and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo  
naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation ; their contact on naboo is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people  
after picking up jar jar binks ( a completely cgi character , voiced by ahmed best ) , they head to tatooine , where they meet young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his mother ( pernilla august )  
qui-gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin , and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys  
the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious , neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters "

comments : watchers reborn , a cheaply made direct-to-video turkey , is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontz's bestselling novel watchers  
technically , this should have been called watchers v , but it seems that this cycle of horror movies , much like many other sequel-crazy film series , has decided to drop the numbers from the titles  
 ( even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi  ) 
the makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago  
this really isn't a good movie  
have you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation ? 
well , any hope a viewer may have had , perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill , will be dashed by the time he's seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn  
they're awful  
these commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer , some weird crap about a dead indian , teens , and wolves , and an "" action "" movie called detonator starring scott baio  
scott baio ! 
what idiot dreamed this movie up ? 
after surviving these abysmal trailers , the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented : watchers reborn  
 "" maybe it won't be * that * bad "" he may say to himself  
 "" perhaps , just perhaps , the bottom-of-the-barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading  
watchers reborn , after all , is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago  
it stars mark hamill -- luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy  
lou rawls is even in the mix ! "" 
unfortunately , the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill ( he looks very sick here ) , and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers , the book  
the latter is really too bad  
koontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good , but he is still my favorite hack writer  
koontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful  
people who read many of his books , however , often complain of repetitive plot devices  
it's definately not a koontz book if there isn't ( 1 ) a psychic , ( 2 ) a super-intelligent dog , or ( 3 ) a psychotic killer who likes ripping out people's eyeballs  
watchers has all three devices , which may explain why it's arguably the most popular of koontz's books  
the idea behind koontz's novel , though highly implausible , is very interesting  
basically , a biological war machine is created : a smart dog can be released in battle , track down its target , and then relay the target's position , psychically , to a large creature designed to kill in hand-to-hand combat  
silly but kind of neat too  
i'm sorry  
i don't mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn , the movie  
i suppose i just don't want to talk about the movie itself  
this turkey is really cheesy  
no one in this movie can act , including mark hamill , and it's difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero  
the cheese factor is only increased when he's involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist / geneticist / zoologist / whatever-the-f * * k-she's-supposed-to-be whom he befriends  
mercifully , the filmmakers opted not to do nudity  
to be honest , the only half-convincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein  
you know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts  
i find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie  
and the creature ! 
yes , the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling  
this creature is shot about 500 , 000 times , but it's okay  
the creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing "
-1,"years ago , robin williams made _jumanji_ , a brilliant achievement in special effects , but a travesty on nearly every other level  
the same can be said for _what dreams may come_ , a boring , illogical , weepie-wannabe that left my senses numb  
don't get me wrong : i love breathtaking special effects and pulse-pounding imagery  
_brazil_ is on my personal top ten  
_the city of lost children_ is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios  
i even love _2001_ and _last year at marienbad_ , being in the minority amidst my friends  
_what dreams may come_ , imagery aside , has little daring thought to complement its imagery  
the daring thought it _does_ have is never fully realized  
it's idea of a plot is so lukewarm , that it insults the bigger questions it raises  
it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences , put on an electronica soundtrack , and sell it as one of those popular _mind's eye_ videos  
robin williams plays chris nielsen , who dies too prematurely--not only in the story , but before we have a chance to really know and care for him  
the director , vincent ward , and the screenwriter ronald bass , have chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience with the afterlife  
big mistake  
it would have been far better to take the half-hour or so needed to tell his life story first ( ala _it's a wonderful life_ ) , so that i can build up respect for him , so i could know and possibly care for him , his children , and his long-suffering wife ( played superbly by annabella sciorra )  
instead , the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story , expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses  
it doesn't  
so in the afterlife , chris learns that ( a ) people still don't meet god , ( b ) that our thoughts are reality , and ( c ) time does not exist there  
hmm    
i+ll grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative  
 ( the "" not meeting god "" part still irks at me , but perhaps there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect )  
that said , this alternate reality still makes no possible sense  
read on    
chris' wife commits suicide  
since suicides go to hell , chris would be separated from his wife forever  
the important question is , is heaven really heaven if you are separated from the one you love ? 
good question  
and i like good thought-provoking questions  
i don+t like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question  
i _loathe_ it when the filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes a popular rescue film , especially a rescue film which does not take its underlying premise seriously  
i _really_ loathe it when it+s story is no longer run by logic , but by special effects  
hey chris : did you forget ? 
your thoughts are _real_  
they are more _real_ than the physical world , according to the new-age screenplay  
so , why don+t you conjure up positive thoughts of annie , and let that run wild ? 
and then she would appear before you , and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity ? 
because there would be no movie , that+s why

the gags are sporadically funny  
it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti-gay jokes  
the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team  
the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film  
sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching  
this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night  
 ( and it turns out he had very good reasons  ) 
 , low 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 
a film needs a plot  
it needs characters for empathy value  
it needs a story and an emotional center  
if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are  
kevin smith has now made two satisfying films , clerks and chasing amy  
with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp  
peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled  
but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith's fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it  
his remaining two films , mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience  
jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes , penis jokes , flatulence jokes , film pastiches , and in-jokes  
how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call  
for me , the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny  
there was not enough cleverness or variety  
it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay  
penis jokes work only so many times  
showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags  
they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford , the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post-war films including dead of night , the lady vanishes , and passport to pimlico  
jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners  
as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts  
in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads  
jay and silent bob ( played by jason mewes and kevin smith ) are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks  
this leaves them at loose ends  
they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie  
they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash  
so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way  
the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood 
the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny  
silent bob , being silent , can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his  
this makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have  
jay has to be the comic  
he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive  
the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny "
-1,"the rich legacy of cinema has left us with certain indelible images  
the tinkling christmas tree bell in "" it's a wonderful life  "" 
bogie's speech at the airport in "" casablanca  "" 
little elliott's flying bicycle , silhouetted by the moon in "" e  t  "" 
and now , "" starship troopers "" director paul verhoeven adds one more image that will live in our memories forever : doogie houser doing a vulcan mind meld with a giant slug  
 "" starship troopers , "" loosely based on the robert heinlein novel , is the story of an interstellar war between humans and giant insects  
in the hands of verhoeven , the mammoth sci-fi battle flick is one of the most astonishingly bad films ever made , a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale  
to put it simply , it's a bug bomb  
in "" robocop "" and "" total recall , "" verhoeven displayed a gift for creating an entertaining mix of violence , special effects and social satire , and "" starship troopers "" starts off in similar fashion , with a tongue-in-cheek futuristic military recruitment ad that shows promise  
things go downhill fast , though , as we meet our heroes , a group of buenos aires teens preparing to graduate from high school  
inexplicably , johnny rico , carmen ibenez , dizzy flores and xander barcalow are played by square-jawed anglo kids who look like they just stepped out of a mountain dew commercial  
it's a veritable "" alpha centuri 90210 "" as we watch the love-smitten teens squabble in the name of love  
michael ironside plays their teacher , who waves around a cheesy fake severed arm while lecturing about civic responsibilities  
eventually , the kids join the military , with dreams of glory in their addled little minds  
one of their classmates , carl jenkins ( "" doogie houser's "" neil patrick harris , ) snags a job in military intelligence because of his strong psychic abilities  
he displays his gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl up his mother's leg  
a long , dull boot camp sequence follows , enlivened only by an extended coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the "" showgirls "" director's camera roams over their buff bodies  
finally , a full hour into the film , the war finally starts and we meet the enemy  
the bugs hail from klendathu and colonize planets by hurling their spores into space  
they attack starships by spinning around and firing deadly plasma blasts from their rears  
yes , incredible as it seems , the bugs actually kill with cosmic farts  
a phenomenally large amount of money was spent creating the computer animated insects and the results are mixed at best  
sweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing to attack are both impressive and scary , but the close-ups are a different matter  
the insects have an odd , artificial look , like origami creations with a mottled plastic coating  
the attack scenes are intensely violent , as one would expect from verhoeven , but the overall look is too phony to generate any real tension  
while the action is frantic , the military strategy , wildly illogical even by hollywood standards , grows tiresome quickly  
verhoeven tries to spice things up by throwing in more satiric news coverage , but the faux-jingoistic scenes of children "" doing their part for the war effort "" by squishing roaches on a sidewalk aren't enough to make up for the long stretches of sheer dreck  
one can only guess what paul verhoeven was trying to do here  
his customary one part satire , two parts ultra-violence formula is way out of whack , and most of the film just flounders  
in "" showgirls "" fashion , some scenes are almost bad enough to be good  
an intergalactic kegger party , with jake busey playing "" dixie "" on a green plexiglas fiddle , has a certain bizarre appeal  
a sex scene between two of the teens achieves a smarmy charm , enhanced a few minutes later when the female receives a fatal jab from a bug , but tells her hero that she doesn't mind dying  
 "" it's okay , "" she gasps , "" i got to have you ! "" 
and then , of course , there's doogie's mind meld with a bug  
it's possible that verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to the era of the original novel  
heinlein's pre- "" stranger in a strange land "" books were aimed at adolescent males , and "" starship troopers "" has the antiseptic retro-future look of late 50s/early 60s sci-fi  
the one cityscape shown is a jetsons-like gleaming metropolis , with flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting  
the hairstyles are retro too , straight from the frankie avalon , annette funicello school of fashion  
ultimately , verhoeven's motives are irrelevant "

i was about forty-five minutes into this one at a friend's house when he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house  
so i never got to finish the movie and i'm sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of a bad movie  
but i can at least get a partial review out of it , because i saw enough to know this one wasn't worth finishing in the first place  
the movie centers around a freaky teenager who's spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents' house  
when grandpa dies ( taking his department store down with him ) , social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder ( first and middle names ? 
gold bond ) to a state home , where we find out he's a different from the other kids  
actually , we find out he's different when we first see him , because he's the most pale individual we've ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever  
when powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie , the father takes one look at him and says "" he's not my son  "" 
obviously  
all i want to know is where the pillsbury dough boy was nine months ago  
so the white-faced freak leaves his neverland ranch for the state home and faces the ridicule of other kids  
that is , until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him "" wear "" his spoon ( "" you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass  "" 
decisions , decisions    ) and he uses telepathic powers to draw all the silverware in the room into a giant pile in the middle of the table  
so if his father is the pillsbury dough boy , his mother must be sissy spacek's carrie character  
and you have to factor in two more things from the subsequent scenes , as we find out powder has some sort of super-intelligence ( "" your i  q  
test went straight off the chart ! "" ) 
and attracts electrical power  
this first shows up as powder visits the world of high school ( if he's such a genius already , why would he need a high school education ? ) and sits through a demonstration in jeff goldblum's science class  
goldblum plugs in a "" jacob's ladder "" device that shows current running up two wires and immediately the current flows across the room and into powder's chest  
but goldblum just stands there for about thirty seconds watching , instead of just unplugging the damn thing  
i guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in a row ( following hideaway and nine months )  
that's about all i saw before the big fight began and , let me tell you , that was twice as interesting as the movie itself  
but like i said , i saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization  
none of these movies ever handle the subject properly , instead introducing the feeble beauty and the beast copout of having a beautiful woman fall in love with the guy's personality , overlooking his personal appearance  
i already had the female character picked out ( the girl who was sitting next to him in the back of the room during the electrocution scene ) , but i guess i'll never know for sure what happened

-1,"martial arts master steven seagal ( not to mention director ! ) has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights , talks in a hushed tone , and squints at any sign of danger  
he's also the most consistent individual in hollywood today , since all his movies suck  
they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art ( that is , martial art )  
i'm sure the guy's good , and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows , although a tad haughty , but these movies he makes are all the same : a guy who is basically indestructable , is maybe wounded supposedly mortally , then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses ( although i kinda liked "" under siege "" )  
of course , this one , as a change , has a "" message "" that is drilled into our mind    of 
course , after he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people  
so why do i watch his crap ? 
i usually don't  
i will never , and you can hold me to this , i will never pay to see this man's movies , unless , and only unless , he's in a supporting role ( i  e  
 "" executive decision "" ) and i'd definitely pay if he dies ( i  e  
 "" executive decision "" )  
but this one has a special place in my heart  
this doesn't mean it's good or that i even liked it  
this was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle , and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la "" mystery science theatre 3000 , "" and this was a couple years before i had heard of "" mystery science theatre 3000  "" 
in this one , seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased-up typical shallow villain , this time played by an oscar-winner to give the movie some more clout - michael caine  
it seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land  
around the 20-30 minute point , seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs ( what with his new "" fire down below , "" another "" message film "" ) , and caine has him bumped off    or 
does he ? 
seagal is rescued by some inuits , and falls in love with one of them , played by joan chen , who can act , hypothetically , but , for some reason , not here  
one of caine's cliched henchmen ( played here with a lot of overacting by john c  mcginley ) shoots the cheif of the inuit clan , and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory    literally , 
of course  
at one point , seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn't have any options but blow stuff up  
he even goes as far as to say , "" i don't want to kill someone , "" and in the same breath , he asks some guy where the arsenal is  
i have no problem with violence  
i'm a huge john woo fan , but he paints his films with suspense , skill , style , depth , characterization , and just plain cool violence  
in the films of seagal , the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly , and him either wounding or killing them  
at some points , they use the cliche of the talking villain , where the villain has the advantage , can shoot seagal , but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan , or saying a corny line , to which seagal says something hokey back , and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them , and does  
this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn't take itself seriously at all , like in the case of this summer's "" con air  "" 
but seagal is serious about his skill , and of course , his message  
i wouldn't mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence  
but seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle , not pounded into the viewer's mind  
the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish , thus we can't take him and his motives seriously , and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment , he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig , and kills some workers who were just doing his job "

-1,"there's a scene somewhere in this film where one of the characters reads the book "" screenwriting made easy  "" 
this is funny the first time just 'cause it is , but funnier as the film goes on since it's totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it , outlined it and then wrote this film  
it's like they took the sub-genre of the disaster pic , which can be fun and hokey at the same time , and then forgot one of the greatest parts of them : the stupid , eccentric characters  
yes , "" the poseidon adventure "" is crap , but it's fun 'cause of all the stupid , eccentric characters  
and "" earthquake , "" my god ! 
 "" earthquake "" has got to be one of the worst movies of all time , but at least they had the joke of having charlton heston sleeping with genevieve bujold  
 "" volcano "" takes a semi-intriguing yet stupendously inane plot ( a volcano no one knew about suddenly errupts one fine morning and then erupts again later then stops    only 
it's in , dare i say it ? 
l  a ! ! ! ) and then puts no stupid , stereotypical , eccentric characters in it  
they're just stupid  
and the actors are all good ones  
tommy lee jones is great , an oscar winner , and a member of the men in black ( my vote for what should be the coolest movie of the summer )  
anne heche is a good indy actress  
don cheadle stole the disappointing "" devil in a blue dress "" from denzel's feet  
and gaby's one of the few good teenage actors  
but they get nothing to do but act dumb and scream at what's going on  
they do their best , god bless them , but they're all lost in the fake magma ( only don cheadle gets an interesting part and he's the greatest part of the film )  
there's no real suspense here 'cause you don't care about anyone  
i actually was rooting for gaby's character to get killed so tommy lee jones wouldn't have to keep saving her ( he did it like thirty times ! )  
and there are no interesting sites in l  a  that we see get destroyed  
part of the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever  
in "" independence day , "" the best part ( other than judd hirsch ) was watching the white house and empire state building get blown up by the aliens  
that was cool  
watching really fake-looking magma plow down the street is not  
okay , so the film's not devoid of merit  
as i already stated , don cheadle was great and the cast does their best  
and there's this really moronic scene which looks cool  
john carrol lynch ( norm from "" fargo "" ) goes on a subway car to save people but the lava comes and surrounds it  
he has one guy who's wounded and could make it  
he could throw the guy and jump and still survive  
but no ! ! ! 
he has to go and inanely jump and land right in the middle of the lava  
here's the cool sight : he melts  
here's the dumb part of it : he somehow manages to throw the man to safety as his legs are melting  
cool sight  
no logic

-1,"when critics attack seemingly well-intentioned films like patch adams or more recently pay it forward as i am about to do , their opinions are often greeted with a backlash of angry e-mails , sometimes even mock death threats from those who ( i suppose ) like to be shamelessly manipulated by their entertainment  
even politicians ( ! ) 
tend to dismiss film critics as heartless cynics for occasionally dumping on good-hearted films while praising "" filth "" like pulp fiction  
these [fill in the derogatory term that you are comfortable with] tend to forget that a film critic's job is to review the movie , not the message , however sweet and endearing that message may be  
thusly patch adams isn't a bad film because it's about a doctor who cares for his patients ; it's a bad film because it's a calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation  
similarly while pay it forward may have its heart in the right place ( though i even doubt that , stay tuned , an explanation is forthcoming ) , it's still an unpleasantly maudlin mess  
the picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher ( a somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey ) , with a burn scared face and equally singed attitude , who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world  
12 year old trevor ( haley joel osmet ) , a disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother ( helen hunt ) , comes up with the notion to pay it forward ; this entails a person doing one good deed ( call it an uber favor ) for three others , then telling them to do the same for three others and before long we're all living in a frank capra movie  
meanwhile in a parallel story , a weasely reporter ( jay mohr ) tracks the "" movement "" which has apparently begun to grow  
pay it forward has odd ideas about tone ; at certain points it hurls a smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core  
it's as if director mimi leder didn't have the confidence to make pay it forward the way she intended , and compromised out of fear that her film wasn't "" gutsy "" enough to earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for  
so the picture adds grit ( a child molester propositions trevor , a homeless man returns to heroin after being "" saved "" , a character is knifed while doing a good deed , etc ) though it seems shallow , incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself isn't quite sure if it's ready to buy into its own utopian blather  
pay it forward offers "" crowd pleasing "" elements for general audiences ; jay mohr's umpteenth variation on the waspy sleazeball , angie dickinson's earthy alcoholic bag woman , and the jive-talking "" black hoodlum with a heart of gold "" ( coming on the heals of the black , god-like inmate embodied by gabriel casseus in bedazzled , this may just be the beginnings of a brand new guilty white liberal clich ?  
hurray for hollywood ) who actually calls the mohr character a "" nigga "" and says things like "" can you feel me ? "" 
leave it to pay it forward to happily include a little minstrel act for our further enjoyment  
 ( maybe spike's flick wasn't so misguided after all )  
these scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you'll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings  
while the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place , to me the final product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience  
it's a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration , with the main players ( all previous oscar winners or nominees ) given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns  
one scene in which a slightly de-glamed helen hunt ( de-glamed here means that not only is she a fashion victim [her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama] , hunt's hair is also natty and badly bleached ) verbally castigates spacey , feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip  
spacey , of course , responds in his cultured monotone , that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance  
maybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating ; though how can he not , even when he's emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference  
the usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender  
in one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet , immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke , and with said hand still on said mouth , she actually begins convulsing ( dry heaving really ) , then ( and i'm not making this up ) she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in a frenzied search for alcohol  
the scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blow-ups ; it's all very theatrical , especially hunt's performance , which feels like a pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar  
pay it forward has the dubious distinction of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn't get academy awards  
the picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists  
even haley joel osemt , the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense , seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections  
his acting has become broader , less intimate ; it's as if we can make out the little munchkin's thoughts : "" boy this outta floor em ""  
naturally osmet is made to play one of those only-in-the-movies children , a martyr-figure who cleans up after his mother , lectures her on the ills of drinking , and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual teacher  
never mind that the two couldn't be more dissimilar ; his mother is trailer trash dopey , and the teacher is one of those dennis miller-ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary  
nevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in a scene that recalls parent trap-ish cornball antics  
but oh how we love bright , articulate , self-sacrificing children who pick adults up by their bootstraps and guide them through life  
they're so adorable  
of course the blame can't all be hoisted onto the actors ( though with the exception of the little kid , they probably should have known better ) , instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder , who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er , then went on to make two awful genre films in a row  
the first being the peacemaker , a witless post-cold war george clooney vehicle , and deep impact , one of the two films of 1998 to squander the premise of earth's possible demise by a crazed meteorite  
the first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich ? s , and a complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement , not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with digital read out ( apparently present for an invisible audience )  
deep impact has more in common with pay it forward ; it's a movie that treats earth's impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms , completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be a goner within days  
the film was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing , though the sappy score swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching  
in pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like a rebuttal : "" see my movie isn't as na ? ve as you might think "" she seems to be saying  
no , it's just horribly confused "

-1,"i'm not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing "" disturbing behavior "" with "" scream  "" 
maybe it's because they're both horror films ( kinda ) , both have hot young stars , both have an annoying alternative soundtrack , and both are aimed at the teenage crowd , which i guess includes me  
but this is not the next in line with the "" scream "" flicks as well as the "" i know what you did last summer "" soon to be flicks  
it owes less to "" halloween "" and more to kafka and orwell , which , in my book , makes for a more interesting feature  
and it should have been  
this is basically a rehash of "" the stepford wives , "" the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross and dealing , as i've been told , with a bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives  
or something like that  
 "" behavior , "" starring katie holmes of "" dawson's creek , "" deals with a bunch of teenagers , deep in angst , who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers  
suck-ups  
preppies  
it actually , at least to me , sounds like it would work , and with scott rosenberg , that witty penmen who has written stuff like "" beautiful girls "" and "" things to do in denver when you're dead "" ( as well as "" con air "" ) , it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit  
alas , it's not , and it plumets into that little group of movies known as "" the movies with potential that blow it  "" 
i remember a film called "" white man's burden "" which dealt with a reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with it's potentially brilliant premise  
here's another one  
it could be a brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves  
it's a stage , and this film does in fact realize that  
it gets its message across and it does it effortlessly  
now it just needs to work as a film  
which it doesn't  
it's too sloppy and too contrived  
it paints a bleak portrait of high school life    then 
lets it lie  
it brings us a bunch of scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kiss-ups who do food drives and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes    then 
gives it a cheap twist : when they get horny , they become homicidal  
isn't it scary enough that they're like this , and can't the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them - not that you could be next to die ? 
the film introduces us two three different characters who , in the beginning , are considered outsiders because they're not ( yet ) part of this clique : the new kid , steve ( james marsden - dull dull dull dull ) , who's having trouble at home because he hasn't gotten over his brother's ( ethan embry , in quick flashes so you don't recognize him - i did ) suicide ; the renegade girl , rachel ( katie holmes , from "" dawson's creek "" ) , who's chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring ; and by far the most interesting kid , gavin ( nick stahl , the kid from "" the man without a face "" ) , who's the most interesting because he's the only character who's given some dimension  
in the film's best scene , he introduces steve to every single clique , nailing each one's fetishes and hang-ups , and it's the best scene in the movie because it's witty , satirical , and interesting - something the rest of this film isn't  
gavin suspects there's something awry with the preppie kids , known as the blue ribbons , and in the tradition of all conspirators , and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve , he's only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff  
here , we have another case of "" the idiot plot , "" where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him , but he may have saved this film from being the dreary , dull film that it is without gavin , who gives it life and humor  
the only other half-interesting character is the school janitor , played by william sadler as a retarded , scary guy who may not be what he seems to be    but 
really , we don't care anyway  
i probably shouldn't mention that this was directed by david nutter , who's works for "" the x-files , "" because that would probably tarnish his reputation  
like the show , he's good at setting up weird conspiracies , and creating a general creepy feel  
most of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect , and some of it works "

-1,"a friend invites you to a movie  
this film would evade the explosions and special effects of standard summer fare , and be grounded in reality  
the plot is as follows : after a terrifying incident , a mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move away from the city  
they need fresh air to get some perspective , maybe to start over  
romance begins to brew , however , as one of the locals , played by an international superstar in rugged clothing , sparks things up , ( especially at a country-western slow dance )  
it stars a rising young starlet , helms a good cast , and is directed by one of the better actor-turned-directors in hollywood  
you accept  
you jump at the opportunity to see , what you believe to be , _the horse whisperer_  
but , poor moviegoer , you have been conned  
alas , you find yourself watching , incredulously , _hope floats_  
oh , woe  
your hope has sunk  
why was this movie made ? 
why was it released ? 
it is a travesty on nearly every level , and has the authority to sink the careers of nearly everyone involved  
at the hands of a better script , the film could have been a gem  
but it is clueless as to what it is about , and only succeeds in transferring same cluelessness to us poor viewers  
_hope floats_ stars sandra bullock as birdy , who , after discovering her husband has been cheating on her with her best friend ( on national television no less ) , takes her daughter and drives back to her home , helmed by a countryish bumpkin eccentric played by gena rowlands , ( she decorates with stuffed wildlife )  
birdy's nephew , travis ( played by _leave it to beaver_'s cameron finley ) , is under her custody , and in one of the film's many failed in-jokes , is always seen wearing a different halloween costume  
what is the point of this ? 
does it make any sense ? 
is it supposed to be funny ? 
the point of the film is to show that the family is eccentric , but i was convinced that the grandma should have been locked up for endangering the mental welfare of a child  
all of this undercuts the plot , of which there is none  
there are only many scenes that are supposed to register emotion  
there's the scene where birdy , who used to be the prom queen , is humbled by approaching a peer she once mocked , for a job  
there's the scene where birdy dances with her father , in the hospital for alzheimer's  
and then there's the sentimental scenes with justin , played by harry connick jr  , who is taking a liking to her again , showing her a beautiful pad that he built from scratch  
and during each of these scenes , i was sidetracked by my earlier question  
what sort of eccentric grandmother go through such great pains as to provide a dog costume , a kermit costume , a cowboy costume ( with whip ) , and a full furred barney costume for her grandson to wear during dinner ? 
what sort of warped ramifications would this lead for the rest of his life ? 
outside of this , there are other sure signs of screenwriters block  
when the daughter stands up to the bully at school  
when birdy almost loses her job  
when the family pulls in a goofy lip-synch to cheer someone up  
when someone dies  
when the daughter cries , ( no , wails ) in exasperation that her father is not coming back  
in a movie like this , you notice the strings being pushed , and you sit there , comatose , hoping it will end  
who can survive such a debacle ? 
i worry for bullock's career , which has been running on auto-pilot for the last few years  
she has an attitude , a solid perkiness , and can drive a bus--but she can't handle the emotional scenes , much less hold a southern accent  
harry connick , jr  is worse--stick with singing , or get some acting lessons , please ! 
gena rowlands is the best part of the film  
but she's such a good actress , that it staggers the mind that she's weighed down by such lukewarm material here  
it would be a severe tragedy if the recurring star of john cassavettes' great films is known for this film

it is crap on toast made of crap baked in a an oven fueled by crap  
it is crap through and through  
nothing works in this film , as to be expected from joel schumacher , who has made only one watchable film in his entire career ( that being "" cousins "" )  
here's a man who admits he's a medicore director , a rather charmingly self-effacing statement  
but truth be told , he is much worse than mediocre  
not all scorn should be heaped on schumacher though -- akiva goldsman should not be allowed to write ever again  
there is no plot anywhere , and the "" dialogue "" is unrelentingly shallow , preposterous , and boring  
they set up mr  freeze as a tragic figure trying to cure his cryogenically frozen wife , then completely sabotage his character by giving him the lamest one-liners  
it turns him into a stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of a brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death  
but that's par for course -- nothing in this film makes any sense , including half of arnold schwarzenegger's lines  
as mr  freeze , arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once  
this is the same problem he had in "" jingle all the way "" , and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as the days pass  
personally , i think that he has more pull with the directors and doesn't retake scenes to make him understandable  
compare his dialogue in the terminator series to the load of nonsense that streams forth in "" batman & robin ""  
apparently , james cameron knows how to get a competent performance out of arnold  
uma thurman is not as bad , but nothing resembling good either  
her poison ivy vamps around terribly , chewing up scenery left and right  
and her pamela isley scenes are marred by sub-snl standard "" acting "" , as if she's reading off cue cards and is about to laugh at any given moment  
given the "" script "" , it's a wonder it didn't happen more frequently  
there is no redeeming feature in this film -- not george clooney as batman , chris o'donnell as robin , nor alicia silverstone as batgirl  
michael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred , as if the conceit of his illness was prompted by his cadaverous appearance  
in fact , there was something unsettling about his appearance , which seems to have been accomplished without any make-up tricks , looking as if it were scenes from a documentary about a dying man  
unfortunately , every scene about alfred's sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance -- they just go through the motions , losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart  
the movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of a big battle -- you know there's a bunch of people , but instead of a melee , schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a fist  
there's never a moment of awe , wonder , or mayhem  
the only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects , which are impressive ( and probably expensive )  
even then , the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that they become unwatchable  
the hockey team from hell ? 
not even the tv series got that stupid ( at least not on the grand scale of stupidity that "" batman & robin "" showcases )  
frustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off with nothing to say or do  
blink , and you'll miss elle macpherson as julie madison , vivica fox as a "" why is she even in the film "" vamp in freeze's lair ( with all of two lines ) , and pat hingle as the most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had  
and in what almost seems like an effort to save on costs , vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs  fries -- she isn't even filmed well enough to look good ( trust me , she's quite attractive outside of this dreck )  
and as if the film weren't bad enough to limp along with bad direction , bad dialogue , bad performances , and bad fight scenes , there are inconsistencies and illogic galore  
i know it's nit-picky to ask where the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs , why the character's arms aren't ripped out of their sockets when they accomplish a one-armed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet ( while holding on to another person no less ) , or where the moisture comes from when freeze's weapon creates tons if ice  
that's all traditional comic book stuff  
but why does batman spring a trap for freeze at a public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of by-standers ? 
why is there a big switch clearly marked , "" heat "" in mr "

the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films  
in a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous  
with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong's best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u  s  productions  
such talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results  
now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai  
unfortunately "" romeo must die "" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong's rhythms  
the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking  
enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong )  
kai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai's boss and leader of the local chinese family  
a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down  
it's not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends  
the following morning po sing is found dead  
suspicions escalate , as issac o'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder  
his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture  
issac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter  
the scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder  
he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined  
hung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work  
escaping to the u  s  han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother's death  
 "" romeo must die "" is in many ways a fun film  
it is both absurd and assured  
the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes "" the godfather ""  
the relationship between jet li's han and aaliyah's trish o'day reminds us of abel ferrera's "" china girl "" , except that romeo must die's couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another  
their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history  
the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable  
li , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination  
allayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace  
it's obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic  
but , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it

-1,"a hotshot lawyer gets an obviously guilty child molester acquitted , and shortly after during the victory celebration gets offered an opportunity to show his prowess in new york city  
the lawyer , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is not offered a job yet , he is asked to simply pick a jury  
he accepts  
the jury he selects work out well and before long he is offered a job with the firm  
making his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money , but a gorgeous apartment  
he convinces his wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) to make the move to new york  
the first case given to him is a big test ; a "" winless "" case concerning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement  
the charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal  
his new boss and partner in the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing , explaining many of his philosophies on law , women and sex , and angles the promise of a blissful , wealthy life  
kevin's next case is a dream case , given to him by milton himself ( much to the chagrin to his colleagues ) , defending a triple murder suspect who has had a history of problems with the law  
although kevin's career is taking off , his home life is not doing very well  
mary ann is starting to have numerous problems  
she is experiencing severe depression over kevin's long hours , and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls , their faces becoming horribly disfigured  
kevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife  
he does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with , then focus all of his attention on his wife  
not helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer ( connie nielson ) also working with the firm  
mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home  
kevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife , and gets disturbing news from his mother ( judith ivey ) about the mystery concerning the identity of his father  
he also starts to lose control of his case  
kevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man  
that man is his boss , mr  milton , a truly evil character who just may be the devil himself  
kevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store  
but how do you defeat the devil ? 
why is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd ? 
do filmmakers really believe that "" normal "" courtroom drama doesn't fit the bill and they have to juice them up ? 
the courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in a real courtroom , which wouldn't have been too bad if it weren't keanu reeves trying to pull it off  
i give reeves credit for trying hard , but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character , just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short  
charlize theron defines the term "" over-the-top "" in her performance as mary ann lomax , a disappointment in contrast to her good performance in "" 2 days in the valley ""  
the only good performance in the movie is by al pacino , but i kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess ? 
maybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil , and you can tell he is having fun doing so , but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him  
it's pretty standard stuff , including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom  
please read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled , but i have to get something off of my chest  
in 1986 i remember watching a movie called "" wisdom "" with emilio estevez and demi moore , and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do  
what i like to call "" guess what , it was all a dream "" scenario  
in "" wisdom "" the two lead characters are killed at the end , only to have one of the characters "" wake up "" from an apparent and say "" gosh , i'm glad that didn't really happen ! ""  
i considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with  
well , the same thing happens in "" the devils advocate "" , and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream ( perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan , since it failed and he is the devil ) , but the point is that the last 90% of the film didn't happen  
i know it's a stretch , after all it is a movie and nothing really happened , but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that  
of course , the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one  
as i recall , "" wisdom "" was a decent film  
 "" the devil's advocate "" is not  
the devils advocate

-1,"best remembered for his understated performance as dr  hannibal lecter in michael mann's forensics thriller , manhunter , scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on  
usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he's only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do  
if you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach's hidden agenda  
cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l  i  e  , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge  
big john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad  
what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light  
he's an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids' problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives  ) 
he'll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world  
l  i  e  stands for long island expressway , which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia  
filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano )  
in his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l  i  e  
highway deaths of filmmaker alan j  pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52  
he's both fascinated and disturbed by the l  i  e  , and those feelings are projected onto big john ( who follows howie around in his bright red car , but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn't want to do  
this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he's a beast , but ashamed of it  ) 
l  i  e  would have worked best as a half-hour short film about howie's ill-advised foray into big john's haven  
there is unnecessary padding with howie's miserable dad ( bruce altman ) in the hot seat for a white-collar crime , degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle-class houses , and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise-ass gary terrio ( billy kay ) , a handsome artful dodger  
rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) , these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length  
concurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted  
cox , sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo , is all bluff and bluster  
dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent  
we're so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious ( calling haley joel ! ) , it's surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene  
the restraint is admirable

action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup  
audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film's sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending , which is an insulting cop-out  
somewhere out there , maybe there's a small cadre of film-goers who will appreciate sphere's dubious charms , but i'm not among them  
i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie ( i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham ) , because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by , it's hard to understand why the rights were optioned  
sphere is the kind of first- class mess that only a top-line director with an a-list cast can create  
with expectations high ( and how could they not be , considering that another barry levinson/dustin hoffman collaboration , the excellent wag the dog , is still playing in theaters ? ) , 
something this bad can't help but look even worse  
the last time a big-name , big-budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year's batman & robin , and everyone knows how that movie was received  
sphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron's the abyss , but , somewhere along the way , it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort , event horizon  
science and philosophy , which are used to good effect during sphere's first hour , give way to mindless , confusing action sequences  
attempts at characterization fall apart  
intelligent writing , which is evident early on , is replaced by hackneyed drivel  
special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness  
but all that is just in preparation for the ending , which is inexcusably awful  
this is the time-honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect  
i left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film  
there is some promise , but it's all in the setup  
we're introduced to norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) , a psychologist who once wrote a $35 , 000 report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered  
when one is found in the middle of nowhere , 1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean , norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee  
on the team with him are beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist who was once his student and lover ; harry adams ( samuel l  jackson ) , a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18 ; ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology ; and harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , the government operative in charge of the mission  
together , the five descend into the bowels of the ocean , where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact  
for a while , sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the man-meets-alien situation  
the overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists ( such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship , apparently from the future ) offer intriguing possibilities  
then , right around the one-hour mark ( that's the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatever's left of titanic ) , the virtually non-stop action begins , and , once it starts , the script becomes superfluous  
this might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension , but , instead , he relies on loud , overbearing music , strange camera angles , and quick cuts to make things "" exciting  "" 
additionally , because none of the characters are well-formed ( a common failing in anything penned by crichton , who's more interested in technology than people ) , viewers don't develop much of a rooting interest  
it makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience  
what about that a-list cast ? 
not surprisingly , the most energetic performance is given by samuel l  jackson , but his harry isn't a person ; he's a walking plot device spouting occasionally-witty dialogue  
dustin hoffman isn't lively or particularly good -- it's ironic that this , which may be his worst work in a decade , has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination ( for wag the dog )  
sharon stone and peter coyote are both flat  
their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion ; automatons would have been as effective  
then there's queen latifa , who , despite getting fifth billing in the credits ( ahead of liev schreiber , who boasts at least quadruple her screen time ) , has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count  
i like to think that levinson and hoffman , recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be , chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance ( the low-budget picture was filmed during sphere's lengthy pre-production phase )  
if that's the case , forgiveness is granted  
i'm less inclined to look favorably upon crichton , although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume ( jurassic park and the levinson-directed disclosure come to mind )  
even if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process , crichton's credit as a producer disallows him absolution  
he was a willing participant in a creative travesty "

nobody can save this bomb from it's own stupidity and arrogance in filmmaking and arrogance in believing that this is a positive religious-type of film  
it's just a pile of dreck    an 
ill-conceived exploitive project , a pyrotechnical film  
 "" end of days "" aims to be an apocalyptic thriller  
it features an idiotic script , a hack director , and a one-dimensional star who is past his prime    which 
makes this film dumber than dumb , plus it's not funny , not campy , or is it in the least bit entertaining  
it's just dreary and unwatchable    a 
big-budget slasher film  
arnold plays an alcoholic security guard who finds his new mission in life is to stop satan ( occupying gabriel byrne's body and possessing a wall st  bank account ) from destroying the world  
the film opens in vatican city , roma 1979 -- where the pope is alerted by a young visionary priest tomaso , looking out at the night sky and seeing a comet whiz by , who proclaims after looking at his scrolls -- that's the sign for the 'eye of god , ' which reveals that a child has been born who is being prepared to give birth to satan's baby ( the anti-christ ) in the hour before the new century begins , when satan will fuck her and open up the gates to hell on earth  
tomaso has some twenty years to find this woman and save her and the world from doom  
but some in the pope's circle want to kill her if found , even though the pope insists on having faith and letting her live , as he lectures them : "" even in the world's darkest days -- doing evil doesn't stop evil , but brings on more evil  "" 
we saw the girl being born in nyc in 1979 , which seems to be the 'logical' place to look for satan according to the astrology charts of the visionaries  
the chosen woman is christine york ( robin )  
it is now a few days before the new year celebration for 2000 and arnold and his wise-cracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired to guard a wall street turd , and when he is fired upon by a renograde priest , thomas aquinas , arnold saves him and through a ridiculous chase captures the tongue less priest who fired the shot  
he , nevertheless , can speak and tells arnold an 'end of days' is coming as prophesized in revelations  
but satan gets to him in his hospital room and nails him to the ceiling while scribbling latin warnings of 'the end of the world' on his body  
it is now up to arnold to save the world and find the chosen woman  
he quickly finds christine and does everything to protect her from all the evil forces around her , as the film includes ludicrous helicopter rescues , people jumping out of windows , satan taking a piss and dropping a match to kill arnold's partner as the piss explodes like gasoline , satan being fired at    resulting in his sometimes experiencing pain and sometimes nothing , as if the director forgot which way he wants to have it  
there is nothing spared in nyc from fire bombs -- including the subway , churches , and luxury buildings  
the only trouble with all these high-budget action sequences , was that it lacked purpose and even entertainment value  
the story was so terrible and inaccurate , that it did not have an iota of value or credibility  
mercifully the movie drags to a final confrontation in times square , trying unsuccessfully to build tension to the countdown toward the year 2000  
why is the end of 1999 considered to be the devil's number "" 666 , '' well !

-1,"as any reasonable human being would , i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certain things  
i am befuddled by fight club  
now sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success until much later , sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later  
perhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their time  
perhaps it is because they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them to sink in do we truly appreciate and understand them  
fight club is either garbage or brilliant , but , at least right now , i must lean toward the former  
maybe i am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowly leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure gold  
but if it is , i sure don ? t see it  
edward norton plays jack , a field examiner for a major automobile manufacturer  
his insomnia , coupled with his compulsive desires to fill his world with ikea furniture to ? complete ? himself , make him a loser at the game of life  
but when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his 15th story window , he seeks comfort in a stranger , tyler ( pitt ) whom he met on a flight home  
once jack is sucked into tyler ? s world , he can ? t get out , literally  
they begin fight club , an organization based on brutal and bloody fistfights that signify nothing other than to provide those that join a sense of belonging  
as the fight club grows , things get out of control and take on cult status , beginning with one future soldier who proves his worth by standing still outside tyler ? s house for three days  
i dare not even begin to bring up the last quarter of the film , since that contains the twist that ? explains ? the pointless journey  
suffice it to say i was truly disappointed in fincher , who ? s previous two films , se7en and the game put him in a very slim category of truly brilliant young filmmakers of the next generation  
this is not to imply by any means that he is no longer a genius or capable of bringing more masterpieces to the table  
but with fight club , he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments and self-referencing film elements , such as talking to the audience about what they are seeing , telling them that the little blips in the right hand corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels and that a slightly altered recurring line is good ? flashback humor ?  
now , throughout the film ? s coarsely woven texture and over-extended plot lines , fight club is obviously trying to make various social comments about the state of the world today  
advertisements , inter-office politics , corporations , you name it , it ? s addressed  
 ( though the media are suspiciously absent from the institutions that are referenced  ) 
all of them play an important role  
how so ? 
well , i can kinda just tell  
i can ? t really put my finger on it  
to say that starbucks and barnes & noble are taking over their respective markets and kicking out the small business owner is no big news  
is that bad for the world ? 
probably  
not much room for social commentary there  
we all know that inter-office politics are just that    politics  
so what was the point of all this ? 
the film seems desperate to make a point , or a number of points , but i couldn ? t figure out what they were  
all i saw was a very bizarre social satire that was woven with strange film techniques , a bleak visual design and some fine acting  
 ( pitt , carter , norton    all of them are good  
even meatloaf is good  ) 
when you get to the end , you will most likely be filled with questions , many of which the filmmakers wanted you to ask of yourself "

this whole "" inner space "" notion is never explained , particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world  
how do they know where superman went ? 
how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ? 
these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me  
argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron  
one day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o' toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman's cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art  
kara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of "" whatever "" that protects the city  
in the chaos , the omegahedron sails out through the opening , dooming the argonians to death    
in three days time , or something  
kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world  
the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who , immediately before her dip was ruined , announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook )  
selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination  
selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she's arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume )  
supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives  
ok    
huh ? 
why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ? 
attention movie : explain yourself ! 
i'm sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much  
i can't buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to  
knowing that she needs a secret identity , supergirl basically "" wills "" herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle ) , picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school "

bad  
that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls  
if that summary isn't enough for you , how about t&a , t&a , t&a ? 
still haven't got the point ? 
other than director russ meyer's predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore-mentioned anatomical areas , there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie  
that is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay  
after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face  
this movie stinks out loud  
quite frankly , this movie deserves a  
but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny  
so i'm giving it a  
and maybe that is too generous  
right from the opening credits , i knew that i had a class-a bomb on my hands  
not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting , but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform  
i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene  
to be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film  
with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it wouldn't have surprised me if the opening had never been explained  
so what is this movie about ? 
you ask  
like it really matters  
ok , here goes  
this all-girl band headed by kelly macnamara ( dolly reed ) and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry  
once there , they do manage to find success ( due as much to their hooters as anything else ? it sure wasn't for their brutally bad singing voices ) , and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them  
everything from big egos , to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral  
there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure , but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing  
>from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here  
other than the above-mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have  
the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts  
mr  ebert has generously thrown in helpings of "" hey man "" , "" dig "" and my all time favorite -- "" this is my happening , and it freaks me out ""  
now i ask you , with lines like that how can you go wrong ? 
ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue  
maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter  
i don't know , but all the big words in the world wouldn't be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting  
but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie  
i've seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey  
in fact , there is one scene -- the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes -- during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries  
add to the directing and writing the music in this movie  
i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken , there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers  
then we have the cast  
first lets start david gurian who played harris , the manager of the band "

-1,"one would think that david duchovny , star of the cult favorite "" x-files "" would be very careful in choosing his leading man cinema roles  
at least one would hope so  
one would be seriously incorrect  
eugene sands ( duchovny ) is a surgeon so dedicated to his craft that he becomes addicted to amphetamines to stay awake and work more  
it turns out to be a bad plan when he loses a patient and his license while under the influence  
ten months later , in a seedy bar to score synthetic heroin , the doctor gets a chance to ply his trade when assassins gun down a customer  
using a plastic water bottle and bar tubing , sands operates and saves his life  
smalltime hoodlum raymond blossom ( timothy hutton ) is impressed with the cutlery skills on his associate  
he kidnaps and then offers down-and-out eugene a position in his organization  
blossom needs a doctor to patch up gunshot victims that would be problematic at a hospital  
sand's temptation is that this will give him a chance to practice medicine again albeit illegally , big chunks of cash to fuel his habit and close proximity to the gangster's womanfriend claire ( angelina jolie ) , this film's babe factor  
the would-be big time operator is desperately in need of help  
on the run from russian mobsters ( the bad guys that seem to be all the rage in this year's films ) and trying to cut a pirate software deal with the chinese mafia , blossom is surrounded by blood  
after a few medical misadventures , the physician grows disenchanted with his employment  
an encounter with a couple of psycho surfer dudes who threaten to blow him away unless he "" fixes "" their dead buddy cements his feeling that he is in the wrong line of work  
when the fbi visits and forces him to become an informant , there is no question that he needs to be somewhere else  
oddly enough , these seem like they could be exciting scenes  
the film disproves that assumption  
then a bunch of other uninteresting things happen  
writing this only two days after seeing the film , its a struggle to remember the events  
you can take that as a solid lack of recommendation  
for all the coolness that duchovny exhibits in "" x-files "" , it's a surprise that his big screen presence is so lacking in charisma  
the doctor is particularly bland and dull  
even the cold turkey bit which is rife with dramatic possibilities come across as banal  
a little chocolate and minor sweats get him through heroin withdrawal  
like virtually everything else in the film , it's a missed opportunity  
the fox mulder detachment doesn't work here  
oscar-winner hutton's manic mobster is much more difficult to get a handle on  
played partially for comedy and partially as crazed killer , blossom almost becomes real , but then sinks into goofiness  
most of the time hutton looks as if he's searching for his character and coming up empty  
jolie also makes a few false moves towards creating a three-dimensional human being before giving up and turning into scenery  
the most interesting aspect of her performance is watching her pouty lips threaten to take over the screen  
the rest aren't any better  
michael massee's eccentric fbi agent never revs up  
one of blossom's henchmen steals a few moments of the show as a quirky gunman reminiscent of val kilmer's doc holliday in "" tombstone ""  
his two-gunned blasting as he does a bizarre dance is the high point of the film  
but that 15 seconds isn't worth sitting through the other 90 minutes  
first time film director andy wilson ( known for his work on the british television series "" cracker "" ) appears to be attempting to jump on the "" pulp fiction "" bandwagon  
the best of these movies combine a sense of style and flash with significant substance "
-1,
-1,"the previews for the movie are pretty good  
they show a little plot , all the characters , and the emotional highlights , all spliced together to give a general impression of the script  
unfortunately , the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes  
the residents of mystery love hockey  
mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football  
the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player who's guilty of shooting another man ( yes , that's one of the movie's jokes  ) 
every saturday , the best players pair off for a game , and the whole town comes to watch  
the town's prodigal son charlie ( hank azaria ) wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated  
mystery's national fame has the town abuzz  
a week later , charlie actually shows up in person , and he brings with him an offer from the nhl  
the new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals  
the mysterians see this as both good and bad  
on the one hand , they'd love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition  
on the other hand , they don't want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes  
the movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition  
biebe ( russell crowe ) has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys , including his new replacement  
he's already resentful , and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife  
crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film , so he's just kind of stuck with constantly brooding  
charlie , meanwhile , is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a man's worth  
his "" gift "" of the feature story , and of the new york rangers , was his way of compensating for not being a better skater  
he hoped it would earn him some respect and merit , but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him  
burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter , the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans  
walter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey , but he actively tries to put it behind him  
he wants his son to take the game more seriously , but he wants his community to just get over it  
reynolds could have been good , but sloppy writing and/or editing keep walter in the corner , and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together  
one character actually was interesting  
biebe's wife ( mary mccormack ) , like the judge , understood that there was more to life than hockey  
but unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community  
she chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open  
her unique insight is verbalized once , and it lasts only a scene before it is gone , but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom  
mysterty , alaska follows a handful of other characters , but none are well developed or worth mentioning  
the biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story , no underlying thing that the movie is really about  
instead , roach and screenwriters david e  kelley and sean o'byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy  
they try to make you laugh and cry , to feel outrage and pride  
they present the framing and cadence for jokes , but there's nothing truly funny  
they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness , but they give you nothing to be really sad about  
as columnist molly ivins would say , it's all hat , no cattle  
the perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about "

-1,"way of the gun is brimming with surprises , some good , most bad  
one of the good ones is ryan phillippe's surprisingly halfway decent performance  
after the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like i know what you did last summer , he hinted at a bit growth in last year's cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance , though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark , precisely when the screenplay made his character grow a heart ( presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans ) and start bellyaching about how he'd fallen for his "" target ""  
it was a dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the film's director could negotiate  
but he seems to be trying and that shouldn't be overlooked ( or probably over praised ) seeing as how , at this point , he really isn't required to do much but look pretty  
here , phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard , his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his "" look here , see "" glory  
it's tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass , but his performance actually helps with the illusion  
unlike ben affleck's puppy dog approach in reindeer games , phillippe is believable and not too bad at that  
as for the plot , well , that's one of the bad surprises ; phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic ( and not even remotely likeable ) criminals ( introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people ) who hatch a scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother ( juliette lewis ) after overhearing that she's carrying the baby of painter ( scott wilson ) , a very well connected wealthy man  
the kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed  
but the anti-heroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man ( james caan ) and two scheming bodyguards ( taye diggs and nicky katt ) remain in pursuit  
directed by christopher mcquarrie , the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects , an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles ( this one included ) , way of the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity  
unlike phillipe , mcquarrie doesn't seem to be growing at all ; he fills his flick with a sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies i know i've seen before and worse , it feels like it  
the film lacks even a fresh approach ( like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey ) to its clich ? s , all of which are spewed before us in a picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is  
it features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life  
even attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have a cup of coffee and pontificate on life , philosophy , etc  i didn't like the bit much when it first appeared in heat , here , it's even more self consciously "" dramatic ""  
usual suspects , which also featured a bunch of low lives that seemed to live by a code they learned from the movies , worked to some degree because of that astonishing twist ending  
nowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur , never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential  
thus , nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret ( most amateurishly projected before they appear ) and it too has an ironic little twist at the end ( nothing earth shattering , like in the usual suspects ) but i admit , i didn't see it coming , and i smiled  
however most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects : a lot of faux huffing and puffing with no rhythm or reason  
or substance  
it's just as overplotted as suspects , and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters , a distinctive style , or a good script would be  
even the good stuff , most of which involves james caan ( doing a fine job ) , feels odd and out of place in a movie that thinks lines like "" karma is only justice with out the satisfaction "" are clever  
at one point caan laments "" need is the ultimate monkey "" a line so inexplicable he might as well have said "" love is like hippo ass ""  
i've seen porno with better dialogue  
and some with better plot lines too  
but rarely has porn offered up such a talented cast ( i mean , can you even compare james caan to ron jeremy )  
caan slips into this role with seeming ease , he could do this kind of soft-spoken tough guy in a coma , but he manages to give his character depth and weariness  
benicio del torro is always welcome , though here he plays it fairly straight ( rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage ) , adopting a brad pitt-esque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering  
speaking of pitt , his ex , juliette lewis , is a weak link , either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness , or waddling about like a silly goose  
nicky katt was brilliant in a brief role in the limey , here his role is just as brief only he seems wasted ; he's only kept around for his cold presence  
taye diggs has a similar function , cool as ever , but never a character , though the guy has one helluva death scene  
for the most part way is incessantly talky with no reason to give a hippo's ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns  
it's vaguely tarantino-ish , but in a bad truth and consequences nm way , with phillippe , in one scene , leaping into a stupid rant about "" faggots "" migrating to los angeles  
you know the routine  
the final shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo ( who himself seems to be doing bargain basement john woo ) with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot at  
but those gun shots sure crack like thunder  
just the other day i was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable and was stunned to hear the weak elephant grunt-like sound that emanated from harry's fetishized smith and wesson "

-1,"one of these days , i'll make good on my promise never to rent another abel ferrara movie  
king of new york and body snatchers notwithstanding ( and bad lieutenant is only fit for a single , emotive viewing ) , his exploitation flicks have fallen into a rut of hoary art-house trappings  
it's a perfume-drenched , coke-addled visit to the seedy pornography shop , where beautiful models ( no , hookers -- no , courtesans ) usher you through the silk curtains  
ferrara's only consistently smart move has been casting christopher walken over and over again , since walken can make a good movie great and a loathsome movie durable whenever he's onscreen  
his 8-minute scene in the addiction is the saving grace of that otherwise abysmal , unwatchable , and pretentious failure  
when he starts talking about his vampiric bowel movements , or questions whether lili taylor has ever read naked lunch , there's a much-needed dose of humor in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair  
you know those gothic club kids who are too cool to smile and let you know they're actually having fun ? 
the addiction is that movie  
walken , sadly , does not appear in the blackout  
the central role of matty , a junkie film star whose lightning paced hollywood life among the beautiful people is inevitably leading to his destruction , is played by matthew modine ( who takes what he can get after cutthroat island )  
much like the protagonists of michelangelo antonioni's terminally bored cultural elite , matty is involved in a bitter pill "" relationship "" with high fashioned model annie ( at least i think she's a model  ) 
matty's lady is played by french actress b ? atrice dalle , arrested twice for cocaine possession during filming of the blackout -- not that you needed to know that , but it lends credence to the idea that ferrara's entire oeuvre has been filmed in a fucking blackout  
no kidding  
requiem for a dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferrara's movies and his controversial urban lifestyle  
matty and annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without consulting him  
no doubt , he was off chasing the dragon  
in his despair , matty indulges in a chemical induced weekend of debauchery , tooling around the streets of miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne ( dennis hopper , in full "" dirty ol' man "" mold smacking models on the ass and telling them to spread their legs  
wider ! ) 
toward the end of the night , they pick up a teenage waitress also named annie ( sarah lassez ) , start shooting a hastily improvised sexual scene , then matty thankfully blacks out  
something happened that night which haunts him throughout the rest of the movie , and it's exactly what you think it was  
suffice to say , there's some confusion over whether he killed annie one or annie two , or anyone at all  
the blackout is typical ferrara : no plot to speak of , plenty of raunch , and horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels and a beer while wrapping himself in a see-through curtain in his hotel room by the sea , by the sea , by the beautiful sea  
cinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistent glory in alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets with docu-style sleaze ( and we're back to dennis hopper leering at girls in bathing suits  
 "" yeah ! ! ! 
yeah ! ! ! 
arrrghhh ! "" 
says mr  hopper  
dirty old sod  ) 
it's compulsive viewing in a tacky sort of way , leading to a ridiculous climax where modine seizes control of his destiny  
how's that for cryptic ? 
never fear -- ferrara finds time for some female full frontal nudity to remind us what he's all about  
i can picture it now  
 "" take off yer clothes , kid -- it's essential to depict the inner maelstrom of my central protagonist , and you're his visual id  
you're the soul , the heart , the bloodstream of the picture  
take it off ! 
take it all off ! ! ! 
ha ha ha ! "" 
friggin' vampire  
yeah , you , ferrara  
a final word about matthew modine : he's actually a fine actor when properly cast , but there's something too squeaky-clean in his demeanor  
he's ideally suited for sarcastic men in tightly controlled situations , such as his private joker in full metal jacket or the time-bomb nebbish in short cuts ( who is every bit as superb as julianne moore in that famous scene , though no one seems to notice him )  
[he was in that scene ? 
-ed  ] 
here , he's asked to let it all hang out , sporting a three-day stubble and oily bangs  
he throws around furniture like stanley kowalski , but it's somehow lacking  
modine lacks the feral intensity of brando , entirely miscast in ferrara's flesh fair  
better luck next time , matt  
someday , you'll be forgiven for cutthroat island , which wasn't really your fault in the first place "

but what did you expect when you clicked on this title ?

cast : kristen holly smith , danica sheridan , alex boling , michael dotson , sonya hensley , janet krajeski , sabrina lu , dionysius burbano , calvin grant , jeff b  harmon written and directed by : jeff b  harmon running time : 97 minutes 
 "" the thought of losing you makes me all vomity inside  "" 
--- blatz balinski ( danica sheridan ) laments the fact that her lesbian lover , april ( kristen holly smith ) , has just received a telegram from her ex-fiance  
isle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot ( smith ) , a resident of the small town of bumfuck , arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson ( michael dotson )  
when april gets extreme cold feet she runs home , sticks a gun in her mouth , and pulls the trigger  
instead of killing herself , she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos , an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed ( except for lance , the homosexual toilet cleaner/slave )  
april loves her new home and friends , but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up  
mr  and ms  pfferpot ( director jeff b  harmon and janet krajeski ) decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr  sigmoid colon ( also jeff b  harmon ) , who claims he can cure homosexuality  
in actuality , dr  colon is homosexual as well and begins his special "" treatment "" on dick dickson ( unbeknownst to dick )  
when april turns down dick's demand for her to return to bumfuck , he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambo-style  
instead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance ( alex boling ) and the two of them , along with april and her lover blatz , get married  
 ( note to the filmmaker : why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i'm assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided ? ) 
april's parents , feeling like there is no recourse , call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer ) their way  
the bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the "" circuitry "" and they re-wire it and send it back to washington d  c  , destroying it  
mr  and ms  pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own  
i'm not sure if writer/director/co-star jeff b  harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs  
either way , he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie  
the film opens with a preacher running a small african-american child out of town , and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan ( during a jaunty musical number ) , preceded by remarks about "" gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others , such as the jews ""  
if harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be , then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film , but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can't help but feel like he had some serious intent  
as for the entire central theme of the movie , i'm afraid that it's one that i just don't get  
i tried to keep an open mind while watching it , but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes  
it was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society  
how does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non-acceptance ? 
i'm not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society , but don't force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren't going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me  
again , maybe i'm missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make , but if so , i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully  
as far as musical comedies go , isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical , but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy "
-1,"battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000 , and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close  
in fact , i'll be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years  
based on the novel by scientology guru l  ron hubbard , battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information  
it's the year 3000 , and an alien race called the psychlos ( which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers ) conquered our planet in nine minutes  
ok , we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind  
when were we conquered ? 
the audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 , 000 years earlier , and if that is the case then we're going to get into a whole bunch of problems later ( trust me    
keep reading )  
also , why don't we get to see earth get conquered ? 
how the hell do you make a popcorn sci-fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film ? 
humans now live as cavemen or slave labor , and for the film's first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver , colorado  
they grunt and groan and babble about monsters  
so , when the psychlos conquered earth , were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills ? 
none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered ( whenever that was )  
this is definitely not the way to start an action/sci-fi film  
one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster , and he begins to fight it  
the "" monster "" turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course  
he turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course , with some shrubs growing over them  
so , in 1 , 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time , with only a few weeds growing over it ? 
anyway , some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl ( john travolta ) a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit  
the cavemen ( led by barry pepper ) are forced to do their bidding or whatever , but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet , or something  
so these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1 , 000 years earlier ? 
and , we're supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who can't even handle a few cavemen ? 
one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos  
so jets left unattended for 1 , 000 years are still able to fly ? 
please , if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood  
why did the psychlos leave jets around anyway ? 
shouldn't they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us ? 
the psychlos refer to humans as "" man animals "" but yet dogs are still "" dogs ""  
why aren't they "" dog animals "" ? 
the psychlos are after mining earth's precious resources , but for 1 , 000 years are unaware of fort knox ? 
why do i even care at this point ? 
i'm a fan of travolta's and i'm glad to see he's back on the a-list in hollywood ( despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon )  
but how did he possibly think this was a good movie ? 
and how did he think he was giving a good performance here ? 
he's more than capable of making a menacing villain ( see broken arrow and face/off ) but whenever his character came on screen i couldn't hold back my laughter  
now despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have , travolta just looks like travolta  
all of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face , but travolta just has a goatee  
also , travolta's acts with a sort of phony upper-class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world  
ooooo , scary villain  
as a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better  
you can make a dumb but good sci-fi film ( i love independence day for example ) , but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth  
i did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening    
i cleaned my glasses , walked around the theater , made a grocery list , chose my lottery numbers for the week , replayed super bowl xxv in my head ( with commercials )    
and still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids  
by the time we actually reach the year 3000 , people should still be avoiding this film

-1,"in the continuation of warner brother's franchise , joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow  
what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film  
avika goldsman's screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another  
this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as "" the client "" is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke  
situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another  
this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone's batgirl , who just happens to be alfred's niece  
the story of dr  victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought  
while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife , dr  freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure , and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment  
now of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live  
now the logic of that little sub-plot escapes me  
if mr  freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death , why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth  
this is indeed a cold hearted man  
the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory  
she wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal  
she joins with mr  freeze in his plan to start a new ice age , destroying all animal life , therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them  
the characters have no logic  
batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films  
now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward / robin , bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure , constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships , while at the same time not really having any  
george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him  
to say that his performance is workman-like is to be generous  
his best performances are still on "" e  r  ""  
bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend ( played by elle macpherson ) , that it brings into question bruce's latent homosexuality  
there is no spark and no passion ( as there was for nicole kidman's psychologist in "" batman forever "" ) between bruce and anyone other than alfred  
and even that relationship is very reserved  
robin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series  
now he's just a spoiled kid  
in "" batman forever "" , burt ward wanted to be batman's partner and friend  
now , robin is suffering from ego deficiency  
robin's attraction for poison ivy is not believable , except for a boy around the age of 15  
his later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest , even though they are not related in a traditional sense  
chris o'donnell , once considered a rising star , successfully burns up on reentry with this performance  
his robin needs nothing more than a good spanking  
the less said about alicia silverstone's performance the better "

-1,"the stereotypical american male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports cars  
producer jerry bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with a movie so loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars , sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze  
gone is 60 seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry  
cage is legendary retired car thief , memphis raines ( don't you love cute movie names ) , who must call upon his time worn skills to save his thick-headed brother ( ribisi ) from being killed  
seems a murderous crime boss ( eccleston ) with a fetish for wood ( insert your own joke ) hired brother kip to steal a ridiculous amount of expensive , exotic autos  
fifty cars , to be exact  
poor kip screws the pooch and bungles the job badly  
if the cars aren't delivered in three days , bossman has a casket carved out just for kip  
literally  
if only someone could save him  
hmmmm   wonder 
what memphis is doing ? 
in order to give the film some emotional heft , there are several subplots designed to tug at our heartstrings or give us the thrill of    yawn , excuse me , dramatic tension  
shadowing memphis is an old law enforcement foe ( lindo ) who's looking to send memphis away  
will he catch him ? 
there's old flame sway ( jolie ) , who had her heart broken by memphis years ago  
will they get back together ? 
shortsighted , thrill seeker kip idolizes his brother , yet resents him for moving away from the family  
will they reconnect ? 
raines old mentor ( duvall ) has long since left the life of crime  
will memphis get him finally caught as he pulls him back into the life , one more time ? 
can you answer all these questions correctly in 2 seconds without seeing the film first ? 
i'll bet you can  
following the opening credits , which fill you in on the accomplishments of the raines family through a montage of old photos , we was taken full throttle into the splendor that is memphis  
he's first shown living the good life teaching young children to drive go-carts  
in a later scene , as misfit brother kip knowingly tells memphis he has the stolen car situation under control , all the while making breakfast , a metaphor is made of shakespearean proportions  
just as a pan of grease flares up with kip clueless to how to quell it , big brother memphis calmly and efficiently throws some salt on it  
looks like everything might turn out alright after all  
you know this because the music swells on the crest of violins  
that's about as strong as the characterization gets , which is a shame  
bruckheimer has a real talent for loading his movies with an obscene amount of talent given the task at hand  
monumentally underused jolie portrays an empty headed sexpot whose idea of sex revolves around cars and memphis  
or maybe it's just the cars  
duvall trots out his ornery , but sweet old codger outfit  
i'm sure he's still laughing at taking a paycheck for this one  
lindo projects a warm hearted , but tightly focused detective that almost transcends the material  
the biggest waste of resources is vinnie jones , who plays a mute accomplice of memphis  
without saying a word , he is easily the most charismatic person in the movie  
like a blast of nitrous oxide , he attacks each scene with a straightforward zeal  
too bad his minutes onscreen are so few  
somehow , bruckheimer manages to attract top hollywood acting talent to high concept , poorly written movies , gussies up the film with lots of gold hues and pleasingly stylized action and they sell like proverbial hotcakes "

-1,"the tagline for this film is : "" some houses are just born bad ""  
so i didn't expect too much from this  
but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre  
i thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont  
i thought , mabe it will be fun ? 
and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing  
but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ?  
these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality  
here is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation  
among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor )  
actually , the doctor is researching the "" primordial fear reaction "" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch ! 
what happens  
but he gets unexpected help from the house itself  
it rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights  
portals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs  
a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth  
filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains  
but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen  
the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture  
is that exciting or what ? 
the worst thing about it is that it didn't have to be bad  
it's based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , '' by shirley jackson  
a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent  
it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience  
 "" the blair witch project "" , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses  
and with a $70 mill  
budget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror  
de ! 
bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening  
he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush  
but why give him a more serious material ? 
in the end "" haunting "" will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont's career as a director  
yet it wouldn't be fair to say that everything is bad  
the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky  
but this is where the good things end  
the music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is absolutely without life  
it's nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza ; visually impressive , but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn't engage  
at first you do not know what's going on  
is this part of the experiment ? 
are these hallucinations ? 
projections of the subconscience ? 
paranoia ? 
but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening  
the house is actually possessed  
it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window  
for ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that's what i got ? 
i believe hichock once said that "" it's ! 
better to wait for a climax , than to see one ""  
this may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only stupid  
they are impossible to take seriously "
-1," * * the following review contains spoilers * * 
 "" please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie  "" 
-- chuck dowling , the jacksonville film journal 
i wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997's batman and robin  
apparently , no one heard my words  
oh , how i wish you had heard them  
oh how i wish someone had stopped him    
because he's done it again  
the plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore , a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale  
in fact , it was everything that 8mm is not  
in the opening minutes of 8mm , we see private detective tom welles ( nicolas cage ) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u  s  government  
keep this fact in mind , cage is trusted with an important case , which he solves  
he returns home to his wife and new daughter , and even finds time to rake his yard ( keep that in mind too , it's important as well )  
he's hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery  
after her husband's death she comes across a film in his private safe  
it appears to be snuff film , a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera  
the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film , hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film  
so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film  
the main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless  
welles is actually selected for the case by the old woman's lawyer ( anthony heald , an actor who always plays the same type of character , that being a bad guy )  
when you first see him , your first instinct is that he's behind the whole thing  
the choice of casting does the film in  
then , as welles begins his investigation , at times we will see a shadowy figure following him  
the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer ( or someone sent by the lawyer ) because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet  
so your first instinct has now been confirmed  
then , when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing , he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced ( in one of those ridiculous "" since we're going to kill you anyway , why not tell you the whole thing "" moments )  
but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he's told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended  
huh ? 
also , when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing , his main goal is to get the film back  
so why did he give it up in the first place ? ! 
the lawyer had the film the whole time , then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film ? ! 
it's totally absurd    
and this is the screenwriter of seven ? 
late in the film there's a confrontation between all the main characters , and after a struggle one of the character's guns ends up underneath a car  
cage , who has been handcuffed to a bed , is rapidly trying to get to his gun , which is on a table  
james gandolfini's character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of "" suspense ""  
you see , the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he's trying to reach it from , and so instead of going around the car to the other side ( where he can easily reach it ) he just keeps stretching  
go around to the other side of the car ! ! 
this goes on for minutes  
then , after cage gets his gun , gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car "

-1,"watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute 'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey  
if the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star  
alas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs  
what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars  
that's pretty generous , considering the movie's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek  
when will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it  
so why such a seemingly high rating ? 
there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage  
first , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater  
the sound and screen kicked ass  
nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way )  
also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie's tension  
i even liked the computer-generated settings  
i usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i've seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities  
also , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain  
william hurt isn't too bad either  
neither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable  
and perhaps i shouldn't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood  
there is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a "" real "" kiss -- no sex )  
it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six  
those movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven  
that type of moviemaking is a lost art  
now for the bad news  
worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue  
it's squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction  
 "" you better hold on to your joystick , "" is one such line  
and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign  
second worst , and closely related , is the screenplay  
the story's exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what's happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest  
once the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived  
when gary oldman easily reprograms will's pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : "" he flipped the switch to 'evil  ' "" 
then there's the tone of the movie  
the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson  
then it could be an adventure movie  
they're mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn't a good enough actor to carry it off  
still , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination  
just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn't mean that we have to bow to a "" promise keepers "" notion of who's the center of a family  
many quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect  
and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie  
in star wars , the rebels were the good guys "
-1,"reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way )  
the guy can't seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : "" rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel "" ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely )  
his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight  
i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , "" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! "" 
it's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie  
and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? 
auteur theory be damned ; it's kruger's "" style "" , not the director's that winds up on screen  
kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut "" sometimes less is more ""  
and his numerous twists can't even claim to be originals ; arlington rd's ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j  pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn't know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the "" character ""    grammar 
be damned )  
 "" how did you know that ? "" 
the stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along  
  
  
since twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger's screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it's no wonder why he works so frequently  
he's quickly becoming miramax's mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects  
this is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr  vehicles  
their company's current logo could be "" we ride the trends ""  
reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head  
although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick  
affleck is such a puppy dog that it's impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone's bitch  
the role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent "" serious "" movie getting  
it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who's played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) 
james frain is nick , rudy's cellmate , a manslaughterer who's found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron )  
ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she's never seen one picture of him  
which works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts  
he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino  
though by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i've described might as well be irrelevant  
this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner  
included : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less )  
though it's an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience  
the flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up  
it would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr  morneau 
 ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this  
he films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart  
problem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play  
character problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off  
the former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear  
but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster "

-1,"the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is a fascinating topic  
finding an all-star cast for such a film is a stroke of genius  
combining all that with a three-time oscar-winning director ( robert benton of "" kramer vs  
kramer "" ) and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment  
in yet another noir mystery set in hollywood -- how many of these have we seen during the past few years ? 
-- the atmosphere is moody , the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere  
over-70 harry ross ( paul newman ) is a washed up cop-turned-private eye-turned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life  
he's screwed up things pretty well ( "" i had a wife and daughter  
now , i'm a drunk ) and is at a crossroads  
a couple of years ago , he traveled to mexico to bring back mel ( reese witherspoon ) , the under-age daughter of jack ( gene hackman ) and catherine ( susan sarandon ) ames and now lives with them  
the ames are former movie stars , past their prime and the three have become fast friends  
one gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up  
to fill his time , he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine  
jack is in even worse shape than harry  
he's dying of cancer with only a year to live  
things do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him  
instead of the routine errand that ross expects , he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another ex-cop who is , himself , full of bloody holes  
this unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherine's first husband 20 years before  
through a series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder ; blackmail ; guns ; mel's mexico traveling partner and his parole officer ; ross's former cop buddies , ex-lover and would-be sidekick , the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to  
it's a film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale , but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about  
the only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario  
by the time they show you , it doesn't matter  
the storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in ross's relationship with rubin ( giancarlo esposito ) , a partner wannabe  
these scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief , however they are neither  
rubin and ross have some past relationship but either it's not explained or i didn't care enough at that point to remember  
a running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform  
it's also not funny , doesn't connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course  
on the positive side , it's often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen  
the three leads all have well-deserved academy awards and turn in accomplished , if not extraordinary jobs  
newman is a grand actor , but doesn't seem quite suited to the dark film style  
he is a bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out  
hackman , also low-key , is believable but lacks sparkle  
sarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is one-dimensional  
the actors do what they can with lame dialog , but they can't pull the film out of the hole it's dug for itself  
james garner who plays ross's old buddy ex-cop raymond hope is always a treat , but even he half-heartedly struggles through lines like "" i'm glad they didn't shoot your pecker off  "" 
the best part of the film is the look at old friends , how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make  
the genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen 
the film doesn't run very long before the audience realizes that it's hopeless  
the only reason for watching is the actors  
it reminds me of disaster movies such as "" towering inferno "" where the star power is supposed to make everyone ignore the film's problems  
in a better world , there would have been second-rate actors in this second-rate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better "

-1," "" mandingo "" has traditionally been seen as one of two things : either a much-needed revisionist look at slavery in the south , or in the words of film critic leonard maltin , "" a trashy potboiler "" that "" appeals only to the s&m crowd  "" 
actually , i think "" mandingo "" is a strange combination of the two , although it fails on both fronts  
it's too trashy to be good drama , but too dramatic to be good trash  
the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell ( james mason ) and his son , hammond ( perry king )  
one day in new orleans , hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede ( heavyweight boxer ken norton )  
although the movie never explains it , a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley  
according to the movie , mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves  
hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him  
hammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves  
meanwhile , hammond has married his cousin , blanche ( susan george ) , because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild  
hammond , however , is happier spending nights with his "" bed wench , "" the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex  
it is quickly apparent that hammond , despite his overt racism , is more in love with his bed wench , a sensitive slave girl named ellen ( brenda sykes ) , than he is with blanche  
hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had "" pleasured "" her before he did  
of course , it's fine that he's slept with numerous slave girls , but the fact that his wife , a "" white lady , "" had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her  
so blanche is usually left lonely and sex-starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen  
blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child  
hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half-black child ( although it's okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond ) , so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth , and hammond poisons blanche  
hammond then finds mede , shoots him twice in the shoulder , and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water  
yes , you read right : the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive  
judging only by the plot , "" mandingo "" is pure sexploitation  
the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible , with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society  
when "" mandingo "" was released in 1975 , it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail ; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs  
dramatically , "" mandingo "" is weak and unfocused , and historically it's mostly confused  
if one were to judge history by this film , it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality , not economics  
not once in the film do we see any of the slaves working , except for a few house servants  
the men spend most of the time sitting around , while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner  
there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves , but "" mandingo's "" overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick ( although there's plenty of violence -- fights , vicious beatings , shootings , and the aforementioned human boiling sequence -- thrown in for good measure )  
some tried to write off "" mandingo "" as a blaxploitation film , one of a number of quickly-made , low-budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies , but it's not that easy  
 "" mandingo "" was studio-financed by paramount pictures , and produced by dino de laurentiis , the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as "" the bible "" ( 1966 ) , the remake of "" king kong "" ( 1976 ) , and the ill-fated "" dune "" ( 1984 )  
the director was richard fleischer , a veteran who was best known for several special effects-laden action movies including "" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea "" ( 1954 ) and "" fantastic voyage "" ( 1966 ) , as well as such superior suspense films as "" the narrow margin "" ( 1952 )  
the script , based on the supermarket best-seller by ken ostott ( and the subsequent play by jack kirkland ) , was penned by norman wexler , who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on "" serpico  "" 
james mason , perry king , and susan george were well-known and respected actors ( mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt ) , and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career  
so why is "" mandingo "" so bad ? 
a number of reasons , including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job  
wexler's script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive ; it combines stereotyped slave-talk ( "" yessuh , massuh "" ) , stereotyped southern white trash talk ( "" fer whut're you gittin' outta bed ? "" ) , and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk ( "" if you see me hang , you gonna know you killed a black brother ! "" )  
fleischer's direction is clumsy , especially during the fight scenes , and all the actors give weak performances , especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable  
nevertheless , credit should be given where credit is due  
despite its exploitative nature , "" mandingo "" was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery  
until then , there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery  
even classics such as "" gone with the wind "" ( 1939 ) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter "
-1,"robin williams is a comedic genus  
that is , he is one when he's in a film that allows him space to move  
 "" flubber "" straps him in a straitjacket , covers him with duct tape , stuffs him in a coat closet and piles furniture against the door to make sure that he doesn't get out  
in a re-make of its own 1961 "" absent minded professor "" , disney offers us proof that more is definitely less  
recycling old films ( "" that darned cat "" , "" 101 dalmatians "" ) dressed up as new is the newest money machine from the home of the mouse that roared  
professor phillip brainard ( williams ) is a terminally forgetful scientist teaching at a small college  
his fiancee , sara jean reynolds ( marcia gay harden ) , president of the college is none too happy with him because he's left her waiting at the altar due to his lack of short-term -- and long-term -- memory  
she's giving him one more chance  
he blows that chance when he invents "" flubber "" ( flying rubber ) and is so excited by his discovery that sara jean is once again awaiting him in her white dress  
his tardiness is helped along by his jealous flying robotic assistant who wants him all to herself  
it's not all bad news  
flubber is a green jello that can magnify and reflect energy that is applied to it  
brainard realizes the commercial potential within the goo can save the school from bankruptcy and being taken over by the town's evil industrialist charles hoenicker ( raymond barry )  
while he's busy with his new breakthrough , the slighted sweetheart is being wooed by his sleazy rival wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald )  
there's a flying car , flubber-enhanced basketball game and an assortment of broken lab equipment : none of which are the least bit interesting or funny  
at one point , my son looked around the audience and asked "" why are these people laughing ? "" 
although williams turns in one of his least inspired roles , he is easily the most lively of the actors  
everyone else comes across as half-asleep  
the re-make is successful in that respect  
it feels like a bad disney movie from the sixties  
i remember the original as being charming , but my guess is that the memory from almost four decades ago has been artificially enhanced by the years  
there have been some updates  
fred macmurray's flying model t has been replaced by a t-bird  
his faithful dog charlie is now "" weebo "" , the hovering robot  
the biggest change is that , with sophisticated computer animation , we now can have films show off special effects without being at all entertaining  
flubber is anthropomorphized into a being supposedly with personality  
the gloop has little arms and legs and splits into tiny little gloopettes for a big dance number  
this has nothing to do with the story  
the only possible reason is to create merchandising opportunities so that kids can badger their parents into taking them to mcdonalds for the toys  
not that contributing little to the plot is a big problem  
there are very few aspects of the film that move the story and those that do don't make sense  
the discovery of flubber is going to save the college because brainard can sell his flying car to ford  
anyone with half a brain would be able to see that his intelligent flying automaton is worth billions  
it's unbelievable that his lover ( well , probably not a lover -- after all this is disney ) starts dating croft after the aborted wedding  
there's not one appealing component of this man  
after the professor discovers that smearing a golf ball with the gunk causes it to bounce uncontrollably around his lab wreaking havoc , i cringed as he picked up a bowling ball  
this guy is beyond forgetful , venturing into the certifiable  
co-writer john hughes used to direct light-weight but thoughtful teen films  
the care behind "" pretty in pink "" and "" the breakfast club "" all went out the window after his "" home alone "" franchise heated up the box offices  
looking much like "" home alone 3 1/2 "" , "" flubber "" even features a couple of vapid goons who get banged around and a cute little boy who screams a lot "

-1,"this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont's debut as a director , 1994 surprise hit speed  
but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead  
annie ( sandra bullock ) is in the wrong place at the wrong time again  
she's going on a cruise with her new boy-friend alex ( jason patric ) , and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger ( willem dafoe ) who has a bone to pick with the shipping line  
they sacked him after he got sick  
now he wants the diamonds stored in the ship's safe for compensation  
that actually is the whole storyline  
speed 2 could do without dialogues  
the movie is all about images and remarkable sound  
i don't really know why this is called an action movie  
except for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies  
first we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie  
then desaster strikes  
sandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around  
i looked for the "" action "" but couldn't find it  
most of the time she is part of the decoration  
the only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door  
now we know that she can handle a chain saw  
we also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds  
the bomb defusal of course goes wrong , but only the furniture is damaged , not our heroes who still are needed  
jason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie , helping other passengers and frolicking in the water  
his initial sea-sickness is suddenly gone , because there are ship , crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger  
he does a pretty good job but i can't blame keanu reeves for declining this part  
then there's willem dafoe , the villain , who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankenstein's monster  
he doesn't succeed , though  
an untidy appearance isn't enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential  
before he tries again to make us believe he is a dangerous man he should practise for a while in front of a mirror  
i can't really recommend speed 2  you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that aren't meant to be funny  
especially the showdown , when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles a whole village is a treat  
there you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie  
in keeping with last year's desaster movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from certain death  
a really funny ( and meant to be funny ) scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision  
some crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie  
had they looked out the window they wouldn't have missed the huge ship racing toward them  
those of you who still want to see the movie should pick a theater with a large screen and a good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects  
in an adequately equipped theater it's as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate  
but the ilm special effects can't save the movie  
for all the money they could have done better "

-1,"dead-bang , an action thriller starring don johnson , lives up to its dumb title , or at least to half of it  
although dead-bang is definitely dead , it is anything but a bang ; in fact , they should have called this one "" dead bore  "" 
in the film , johnson plays    
you guessed it    
a cop  
the role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character , jerry beck , is a gritty los angeles homicide detective , a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on "" miami vice  "" 
a la mel gibson in lethal weapon , beck is an emotional wreck , complete with violent outbursts , unscrupulous police methods , and a bleak outlook on life  
beck's wife has just divorced him , and she is cutting him off from their children  
she will not even allow him to wish them "" merry christmas "" by telephone  
but beck's family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in dead-bang  
beck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop  
his investigation starts in l  a  and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma , where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp  
virtually every aspect of dead-bang is inept and ineffective  
the plot is incoherent and full of holes  
the movie depicts beck's investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions  
the action sequences in dead-bang are strictly third-rate , and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense  
i certainly expected more from long-time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller , the manchurian candidate--as well as black sunday , seven days in may , and the french connection ii  
in all fairness to frankenheimer , however , i should note that most of dead-bang's shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction  
dead-bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy , but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting  
according to the movie's production notes , dead-bang is based on the real-life experiences of still-active detective jerry beck  
you would never guess this from watching dead-bang , however , since the film totally lacks credibility ; it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable  
most of the characters in dead-bang are either atrociously acted , underdeveloped , superfluous , or all of the above  
william forsythe , for example , is painfully bad as arthur kressler , a wholesome by-the-book fbi agent who's offended by beck's foul language and unorthodox methods  
forsythe's lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable  
dead-bang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid ( "" wkrp in cincinnati "" and "" frank's place "" ) , but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role ; he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains  
the sole function of penelope ann miller's character is to give dead-bang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less  
i guess the film's title refers to this love scene since it's definitely a dead bang  
the only real virtue of dead-bang , believe it or not , is don johnson , who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie's pitiful script  
johnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth , and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life  
and i must admit that dead-bang does have one or two amusing moments  
the funniest scene has johnson throwing-up all over a criminal as he interrogates him  
but when barf is the highlight of a movie , you know the movie's in trouble  
the other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck , in which he can't keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen "
-1,"at one point in this movie there is a staging of an opera that goes completely wrong  
but one member of the crowd stands up and cheers , thinking the performance was planned , and applauding it for their efforts  
that's "" dirty work "" in a nutshell  
a very different kind of movie  
this is not a movie that i can easily review  
the critic in me analyzes the structure , plot , acting , characters  
  
  and 
tells me this movie is terrible  
but the norm macdonald fan in me had me rolling on the floor laughing  
this movie plays more like an hbo sketch comedy than a movie  
it's a one note concept  
mitch and sam need $50000 in order to bribe a doctor to give their father a heart transplant before other more needy patients  
realizing they are very good at revenge plots , they open a revenge for hire business , eventually running afoul of a rich businessman played by christopher macdonald ( who after roles in "" happy gilmore "" and "" veronica's closet "" seems typcast in this role ) , who sends them to destroy a building that mitch learns is the home of his girlfriend's grandmother , thus leading them to plot against the rich businessman on the night of the grand opening of a new opera house  
first the critic in me  
the plot is the standard poor guy vs evil rich guy device , where the main character meets the girl of his dreams along the way  
here's the catch  
none of the characters are sympathetic  
they're all selfish jerks who don't care who they hurt in their attempts to do whatever they want  
the jokes are juvenile , crude , appealing to the worst elements in people  
there's jokes about prostitutes , the homeless , beastiality , anal sex  
there's even a subplot that's developed , it seems , only to make jokes about infidelity and incest  
and i loved watching it  
i was a huge fan of norm macdonald's sarcastic , to-the-point comedy on saturday night live , and this movie is an hour and a half of it  
norm macdonald takes a joke , strips it to the core , and tells it like it is with a dry wit  
like the scene were he and his friend are learning the ropes at a new construction job  
the foreman goes over the basics , which mitch and sam don't understand  
how do they get out of it ? 
by admiting they lied on their resumes , and don't know a thing about construction ! 
and surprise , they get fired  
the characters are incredibly mean-spirited  
there's a father who's loud and obnoxious , a gambling addicted doctor played by chevy chase who tells sam of his father's condition by saying "" if i were a gambling man i'd put a lot of money on death  "" 
the businessman cole who always has his dog spunky , and does who knows what with it  
and then there's mitch and sam , who , thinking they can get $50000 by destroying a building , ponder how their actions would ruin the lives of the residents  
 "" too bad we have to do it , "" mitch says  
here's a movie where every joke that is executed as it is set up , where you see every punchline coming , where every spot profanity could be used and then is used  
at least the film is honest , and makes no mistake that it is anything more than idiotic  
but at least it isn't dull , and it isn't predictable  
and that's the way it should be  
it's sketch comedy , and if you're a fan of norm macdonald , you'll love it  
the jokes are crude , the characters are mean to the core , the attitude of the movie is that it just doesn't care "
-1,
-1,"in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black  
sir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner  
his oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake  
the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes  
hopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts  
whichever one you like , dear , he says  
and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries  
i liked that scene for two reasons  
first , the cakes looked really cool  
second , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act  
meet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot  
it's easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it's even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely )  
the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess  
i know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy  
case in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie  
however , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani  
 ( it's not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense  ) 
it shouldn't take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr  pitt  
and indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished  
well , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous  
so , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately  
anyway , the deceased lawyer's body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role  
the idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world  
if this weren't hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who's wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn't know how to act in our society  
it also doesn't help that the character of death is written so inconsistently  
he claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one )  
he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois  
he knows everything about some characters , nothing about others  
and as played by brad pitt , he's not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he's just there  
it's as if someone told pitt , "" never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty  "" 
it's as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie  
i've used the phrase "" angel of death "" in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt's performance with this year's best angel performance , nicolas cage's in city of angels  
where pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows  
where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant  
cage struck instant chemical sparks with co-star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani's character is so shallow that she can't see beyond pitt's good looks  
the movie's other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn't save meet joe black  
sir anthony hopkins isn't given much better material to work with , unfortunately  
he plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood "
-1,
-1,"it was with a huge lack of something to do that i decided to watch this on good old upn on sunday afternoon , when the only good things on tv are the second-rate movies they show ( some are good : they showed "" total recall "" before this one )  
if you know me , i think seagal is probably the most boring action star to ever live  
and this includes keanu reeves  
what do i hate about seagal ? 
i hate how he uses one facial expression for every single threatening and non-threatening situation ( the squint )  
i hate those scenes in every movie where he goes around , bullying people up , saying stupid lines with a brooklyn accent more fake than burt reynold's hairpiece in "" boogie nights  "" 
i despise how he never gets a bruise in any of his fights  
i hate how every single plot twist leads to just a melodramatic fight between he and the chief villain  
i hate his non-satirical messages ( in the beginning of this one , he slaps on a quote from arthur miller , which has nothing to do with the film , except it's about brooklyn where this film takes place )  
and i hate how he's so narcissistic that he thinks that he can actually fucking sing ( during the end credits , he has a good old hill billy rock tune sung and penned by him )  
sure , the guy's probably a nice guy in person ( i actually found him very non-threatening when he was on letterman not too long ago )  
but the guy makes worse films than reagan did  
so what's the plot of this shit-terpiece ? 
well    something 
about him trying to catch a stupid-ass crook ( william forsythe ) who shot and killed his partner in broad daylight  
i couldn't believe how bad this scene was - the guy was conveniently with his family so we get the maximum emotional effect ( ahem ! )  
and forsythe even said some stupid lines to him before he took off  
i'm sorry , did anyone ever hear of concealing one's self ? 
so in comes ex-brooklynite seagal , who dedicates his life to catching this guy  
and i just wished he had caught him in the beginning , then ended the film  
but noooo , this drags on , as he bullies forsythe's family members ( including a stupid bar-owner , and none other than gina gershon as his other bar-owner sister )  
and forsythe more than once threatens his family  
at one point , he actually comes to their house and stalks them like a non-threatening nicholson in "" the shining "" ( complete with them all hiding in the bathroom , but with an added bonus of one girl conveniently loosing her cool and screaming to give them away )  
seagal paints himself as a lovable person , with a son , and a fiancee  
he even shows him hanging with his son , checking up on his homework , and then about to take him out for a bit of "" catch , "" when he's conveniently called away on assignment  
i dunno about you , but playing "" catch "" with seagal was one of my childhood nightmares  
he also shows him as that bad-ass he wants to be , with scenes of him bullying crooks around , and taking out people who are stupid enough to attack him even after he's unarmed a chinese guy swinging bats with a pool cue  
serves them right  
this film , as some of his do , has an interesting supporting cast of actors who are actually talented , but don't appear to be in this film  
i already mentioned gina gershon ( who's pretty horrible in this one ) , as well as william forsythe , who over-acts terribly  
i know this guy can act : he was awesome in "" raising arizona "" as goodman's partner in crime  
but he's just awful here  
jerry orbach gives the only credible performance in the film as the police chief who checks up on segal after things have gone down  
why is he the only one who gives a good performance ? 
well , because his role is small enough and sporadic enough to not tarnish his credibility  
he seems to be in here just to give it a cool "" law and order "" feeling ( even if it's not a "" cool "" feeling )  
and in cameos are b-rated erotic-thriller-cinemax-style stars , shannon whirry ( as "" terry malloy , "" which is more of a bad joke than a clever one ) and athena massey  
oh ! 
and "" er "" 's julliana margiulles has two scenes  
 "" out for justice "" just proves once again that american action films just suck  
i know that there's such a good thing as good action - he's called john woo  
but if you're in the mood for some good old no-brainer , fun-yet-dumb action , don't bother watching this "
-1,"a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels  
first , there's the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie  
but occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery  
no no    
just kidding  
had you going there for a moment , didn't i ? 
in all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games  
the first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it's 5 billion inhabitants )  
the mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth  
unfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance  
the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game  
i'd even go so far as to say that many folks who didn't know about the game probably enjoyed the movie  
the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn't try to overachieve  
there were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot  
and , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office  
mortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie  
shao khan has decided that he's going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament  
thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid  
one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought "" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now  "" 
too bad they didn't simply stick with the formula from the first movie  
i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : 
 * the acting is truly bad  
sandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie )  
 * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i've * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder  
in the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics  
i generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim "" tiny "" lister , jr  being cast as the president of the u  s  in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite "" utility "" actors but he's so totally wrong for this part that he doesn't even have the luxury of amused self-awareness  
 * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again  
 * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva )  
for these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2    
    unless you're a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie  
in that case , the following critiques also apply : 
 * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter "

as sick as this all is , watching it is one of the most admittingly hysterical moments i've ever witnessed  
sure , it may be in bad taste , but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive to some but is riotously amusing to the rest ? 
then there's "" caligula  "" 
this film features incest , necrophilia , beastuality , anal rape , homosexual felatio of both sexes , elaborate and lengthy orgies , a greased-up fist forced up a man's rear , wine poured down a man who's had his urinary tracts tied off , a penis chopped off and fed to hungry dogs , etc , etc , etc  this could very well be a respectable film , and if could have been had the following not occurred : a ) the events were graphically shot in clear view ; b ) the tone was not that of trying to shock comically but to , well , show "" historical accuracy ; "" c ) the film was a 20 million dollar production with lavish sets , a rather impressive cast , and a whopping 2 1/2 hour running time  
produced and funded by none other than bob guccione , owner of penthouse magazine , "" caligula "" comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since "" plan 9 from outer space "" because underneath there's a sense that everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified , but also brilliantly entertaining  
after all , it's not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments , but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry  
no film should be discarded because its content , because film is never about what it's about , it's about how it's about ( as the old cliche goes )  
those who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with "" caligula , "" and that's that it's nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish , without a second of credibility in its mammoth running time  
 "" caligula "" allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name , a man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as a blessing    or 
so i guess , even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons  
the film opens on the wrong note , of course , with a quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen , using the over-used passage "" what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul , "" depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer , fucking around with his own sister in a field ( i suppose if one has to lose their soul , one has to have a soul in the first place )  
the plot is so incomprehensibly done that all i or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula ( disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell , a performance that does the opposite that his performance in "" a clockwork orange "" did ) is next in line for the throne but can't wait for the current emporer , tiberius ( peter o' toole - ditto , only for his performance in "" lawrence of arabia "" ) , his grandfather , to die    so he kills him and ascends to the throne  
then he abuses his position , marries a woman ( helen mirren , who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting ) so he doesn't just have to sleep with his sister ( a dreadful teresa ann savoy , there to be pretty , naked , and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with ) , abuses his position a little more , a little more , and a little more , and then , i believe , invades england , then is killed off  
the filler , instead of recounting his life , is supposed to be , as guccione claims , the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome , complete with orgies , vicious deaths , and lots of nudity  
but instead of being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be , it instead becomes guccione's twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like  
oh , isn't it great that they just loved having sex ? 
and that they killed people so disgustingly ? 
and wouldn't it be great if i could make a couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though it's so blatantly real bad porn that i've completely convinced myself that it's not  
i mean , why not just show a roman orgy when i can spend a good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up  
and it's not just that it's disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film - it's that in a film where the entire feel it's going for isn't felt , it's also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time  
the sets are lavish , but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this  
but that doesn't matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if a light meter was used at all , making this not only dark and ugly , but just plain dark  
the camera operation is also the worst i've ever seen in my entire life  
not only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever , but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them , then have them out of focus  
the editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow  
there is no writer to speak of ( what the hell does it mean that it's "" adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal ? "" ) , but nevertheless , the dialogue is shit , so laughably bad that i can't in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over 5 could say them with a straight face ( my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius : "" he could go at any moment , but with care , he could last a year or so  "" ) 
the music in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian ( they use his gorgeous "" adagio of spartacus and phrygia , "" ad nauseum ) , used in an attempt to give the film some emotion , but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere  
the orgy scenes ( and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo ) are the result of reshoots by guccione himself , which are so obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the embrassment ( every five seconds or so , the film cuts to random nudity , as if it was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated "" x "" )  
john gielgud represents the only voice of sanity , walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra , "" i'm going to kill my agent , i'm going to kill my agent    "" 
and so on and so on , for over 2 1/2 hours , making "" caligula "" about as exciting and enriching as a three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously annoying  
guccione , in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made a film that is such a painstaking , arduous task to watch in its entirety that i doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage  
throughout the entire film , the presence of guccione is easily felt , as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen , pretentiously looking down upon us saying "" look what i can get away with ! 
and if you don't like this , then you're a prig , and worse than that , you know nothing about history ! "" 
uh huh  
there's a clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something that's artistically good "
-1,"movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good , the bad , and the despicable  
i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in '95 , but i wanted to re-write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics  
we need to be warned about some truly awful films , too  
this picture was so bad , it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below )  
the only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno  
so , it does indeed have some plusses    
in fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff  
and her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone  
this character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ? ) 
far too annoying far too often  
like in 1998s "" bulworth "" , when the movie was over i didn't care one little iota about the main character  
at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though  
 "" showgirls "" is too stupid to make a statement  
some people claim that the story is based on the legendary "" all about eve "" of all things ! 
if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l  mankiewicz was , he'd be    well , 
he'd be a good screenwriter  
instead , this project may have sunk his career  
he wrote the ( ha ha ! ) 
script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed  
the same team who created a good sex-film in 1992 ( "" basic instinct "" ) struck out here with their occasional violence , gratuitous x-rated sex scenes , and numerous ( and quite unnecessary ) lesbian overtones  
the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer  
after the supposed street-smart young "" lady "" gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack-jawed yokel in the opening sequence , she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the "" stardust hotel ""  
nomi doesn't take advantage of this contact to break into the big-time of dirty dancing right away  
first , she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club  
she sells her hot little wares at "" the cheetah "" for a short time , turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience  
hey , i never said she wasn't a hot number    
maybe it's that , her body , which gets her into the big-time when the star of the "" stardust hotel "" , crystal connors ( gina gershon ) stops into the strip club ( it certainly isn't her brains or pleasant disposition ! )  
crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend ( kyle maclachlan )  
he also happens to be the pleasure-seeking worm who runs the big show  
crystal gets nomi onto the "" stardust "" team and , after an interminable amount of time , nomi "" earns "" the role of crystal's understudy  
the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal  
it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she's "" not a whore ""  
that's a phrase we hear a few different times and it's completely ludicrous  
of course she is ! 
she sells her soul to make it big , but in the end we're supposed to believe that she's a better person than that  
we're supposed to root for her "

this year's crop already seems inferior to that of past summers , even 1997's lackluster trio of batman & robin , the fifth element and the lost world  
the marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered on godzilla ( "" heeere , lee-zerd , lee-zerd    "" ) , which doesn't make me optimistic about future summers  
godzilla is , of course , based on a series of cult movies ( translation : really bad movies only a few people can tolerate ) from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turner-owned cable stations  
that this big-budget remake won't rise above its roots is fairly obvious  
the credits show us the origin of godzilla  
in five words : nuclear explosion creates giant lizard  
sounds like an enquirer headline , doesn't it ? 
the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable "" discovery "" sequence  
this time , a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling ( if that ain't a stereotype    ) 
when he discovers the telltale radar blip  
people die  
cut to our protagonist , played by matthew broderick  
he makes his first appearance wearing headphones , warbling along to "" singin' in the rain  "" 
it's a none-too-subtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie  
no dice , bueller  
from the beginning , poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzilla's enormous footprint  
every disaster movie has to have a know-it-all scientist , and this time broderick is it  
as the world's leading expert on radiated earthworms ( and wouldn't you love to have that printed on your business card ? ) , 
broderick is invaluable to the government  
he immediately dispels vicki lewis' theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because , hey , you can't take seriously the intellectual arguments of "" newsradio "" cast members  
broderick instead hits the nail on the head , announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard  
 "" the radiation isn't an anamoly , "" he announces , and lightning strikes  
 "" i believe this is a mutated abberation , "" he continues , and lightning strikes again  
it's vocabulary lightning , you see , activated by words of four syllables or more  
meanwhile , we're introduced to our new york cast , headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist ( maria patillo ) , broderick's former love  
gee , what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time ? 
poor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer  
italian cameraman hank azaria tells her she's not ruthless enough : "" nice doesn't get you anywhere in this town  
it's dog eat dog  "" 
actually , it's lizard eat city , as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apple's core  
the filmmakers provide us with a one-note drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla  
 "" i think i've got a bite , "" he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him  
you can guess what happens next  
similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city

-1,"sometimes , when i decide to write a short story or a poem , i think of a title first , and then think of a subject to go with it  
it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence  
i wouldn't be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits , and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it  
the title sequence is so good , so ominous and original , that it had me engrossed before the picture even began  
of course , my attention dwindled shortly into the film  
disturbing behavior , like so many thrillers , starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous  
it's a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex  
it's a suspense film with no suspense  
it's an evil small town story with no story to speak of  
it's a disaster , a listless and uninspired disaster , that just barely misses one-stardom because of a few good sequences , a mercifully short running time , and one terrific set of opening credits  
our main man is a fellow named steve clark , blandly played by jimmy marsden  
he moves to a small town with his family after , tragically , his brother shoots himself  
steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother ; we learn this through strange home-video like nightmares that he has occasionally  
the big trial for steve is , of course , to fit in at school and make new friends  
marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail , so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject  
as a social reject , he falls in with some pretentious dope-smoking philosophers , gavin ( nick stahl ) and rachel ( katie holmes )  
gavin informs steve that the local group of jocks , known as the blue ribboners , are actually a bunch of zombies , assimilating new members into their group , while sporadically killing innocent people  
so , it's up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1 ) solve the mystery , and 2 ) do something about it  
by the end of it all , something has happened and things have been explained , but the film still doesn't make any sense  
disturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg  
i've seen his name around recently ( he was one of the toucher-uppers on the armageddon script ) , and i imagine that , for the most part , he knows what he's doing when it comes to screenwriting  
he did , however , have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film , and then decided to actually take the time to write it out  
evil small town films are pretty common ( the last one , phantoms , is also a dismal failure ) , but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work  
rosenberg's script is a complete mess , lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization  
and it makes no sense , nor is their any purpose when things are finally "" explained  "" 
there is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks , but the film never explains exactly what * is * happening  
they get strapped to chairs , a microchip is inserted into their eyes , and -- poof -- they become sex-crazed , superviolent , machine-like creatures  
the doctor responsible for all this , dr  caldicott ( bruce greenwood ) , must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave ( or , perhaps , this is the only realistic element in the film )  
much of the writing is simply bad , and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act  
in one terrible scene , gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques , while pointing them out in the cafeteria  
up front , i should say that , in four years of high school , i did not eat in the cafeteria even once  
that aside , the various social groups he points out are general , uninteresting , and poorly-shown  
for instance , he points to the "" nerds , "" who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops  
it's such an obvious cliche that i can't believe rosenberg even bothered  
most of the dialogue is forced ( no one says , "" bite me ! "" 
anymore ) , and none of the scenes have any degree of wit  
this picture is not inspired , and most scenes flop from one to the other , with no sense of momentum or energy  
the blame for this can be placed on director david nutter , who apparently likes his films dry  
horror films should at least exploit violence , but this one is shockingly timid "

-1,"some movies' pre-release buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when they're finally released , everyone just goes along with it  
thus sometimes , films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations  
last year it was the thin red line  
this year's "" winner "" is the hurricane , pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool  
acclaimed director norman jewison's biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun  
and that's supposed to be ok because , see , it's a true story  
it's about rubin "" hurricane "" carter ( denzel washington ) , a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly ( racist ! ) 
detective ( dan hedaya ) who's had it in for the "" big-shot "" hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife ( in self-defense but who cares , right ? ) 
when rubin was only ten  
he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole  
most of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison  
to the rescue -- lesra martin ( vicellous reon shannon ) and his team of wanna-be detectives  
lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three well-off canadian white people ( hanna , unger , schreiber ) to get an education  
lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his very first book -- "" the sixteenth round , "" rubin's autobiography  
immediately thereafter , schreiber's character tells lesra "" sometimes we don't pick the books we read , they pick us  "" 
hmmm  
after a few visits to the prison , they become convinced of rubin's innocence and launch their own full-scale investigation even though two juries have convicted him  
they meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses ( i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces ? ) and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane's innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings  
of course , we're already told that he's innocent  
a movie like this is especially frustrating because we're not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life  
all too obviously , we're getting the hollywood watered- down version  
that would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it  
it's almost cruel  
the melodrama isn't of the entertaining kind either ; it's the hokey , rammed-down-your-throat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity  
witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo-saintliness of our four protagonists  
the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it's a no-frills courtroom movie  
it's formula stripped to the bare necessities  
you have your wrongly accused black man  
you have your melodramatic final courtroom scene  
but there's nothing else  
you'd expect some sort of involving investigation  
but that's not necessary since we're implicitly informed of his innocence  
thus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding  
brooding to himself  
brooding to other inmates  
brooding to lesra  
brooding to lesra's canadian friends  
brooding in letters  
i don't think i'll ever look at brooding the same way again  
it wasn't long before i got tired of hearing the hurricane's exceedingly deep meditations on his condition  
i wanted something to happen "

in our modern world , where the cool rule , it's hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming 'the man'  
and yet - film after film , after film , is based on his everlasting magic  
in warner brothers' latest production , shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat , while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away  
though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare's 'romeo and juliet' , its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york , is very hard to associate with shakespeare's poetry  
the film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city - the afro americans against the chinese  
the youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered  
the afro-americans are immediately suspected , but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers  
it is at this point that han ( the romeo of the story ) finds out about his brother's death  
escaping from a prison in china , he returns to united states to avenge his brother's fate  
but before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks , he falls in love with a mysterious beauty  
the only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy   
there's only a weak echo of shakespeare's talent in this disappointing production  
and there are more problems besides its title  
of course we don't call it a deformation of a great masterpiece  
we call it 'modernization'  
it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics , without any car chases and gun fights  
this lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing  
kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn't need to be updated , because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature  
and as long as love , hate , honesty and corruption do exist , everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare  
i must admit that i found 'rome must die' very confusing  
i can forgive andrzej bartkowiak , since it is his first attempt at directing  
he manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision  
unfortunately he completely forgot about character- and story developments  
his latest picture is therefore visually impressive , but intellectually hollow  
the love story between han ( jet li ) and trish ( aalyah ) , and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified  
jet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice  
their achievement save this film from being completely braindead , but they are not actors , and therefore can not act  
they are nothing more than two celebrities put together  
the other actors , including isaiah washington , russell wong , henry o and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances  
delroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality  
but there's more than acting to worry about  
even with li's incredible skills in martial arts , the action scenes ( though technically excellent ) are too long and story updates simply embarrassing  
to make a long story short : 'romeo must die' is not intelligent enough to be a thriller , not sensual enough to be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film  
it is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to 'romeo and juliet' , so the film is completely stuck - not sure of what to be  
and in the end it's nothing  
there are no performances worthy of notice , no interesting character- or story surprises  
so again , the only good thing about it is its technical achievement "

if there is one good thing about joe vs the volcano , it is that the plot is original

the movie begins with joe ( tom hanks ) going to work  
this opening sequence is very boring and slow  
it shows joe walking to his office  
but on the way , he has to wait in a long line passing by strange and slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious lighting  
a sequence like this should take 2 minutes

-1,"in china in 1982 i turned the tables on our national guide and asked him if he had any questions about america  
i guess i was expecting some sort of political question  
instead , i was dumfounded by what was most on his mind  
 "" in america , do wives and their mothers-in-law get along well ? "" 
he assured me in china that they did , but i am certain if that were true he would not have asked  
even in china people seem to have problems relating to in- laws  
perhaps some of life's most difficult relationships arise when families are suddenly artificially joined by marriage  
a man trying to relate to his new prospective in-laws and vice-versa could be the basis of a very strong comedy  
meet the parents does not demonstrate that fact , however  
greg focker ( played by ben stiller ) has been dating and in love with pam byrnes ( teri polo ) for ten months and is now ready to propose to her  
he will do it during a weekend visit to meet debbie's family and to attend her sister's wedding  
from the beginning the relationship is awkward between greg and jack and dina byrnes ( robert deniro and blythe danner )  
through no fault of his own , the airline has lost greg's luggage  
and he has to ask to borrow clothing  
it is the beginning of a game of one-upmanship in which greg is nearly always one-down  
as the games go on greg is more and more uncomfortable and uneasy which only contributes to the mistakes he makes  
greg is playing a game he does not understand , in a league he is new to  
but perhaps along the way he will discover some unexpected secrets about his father-in-law  
this film had potential in its tale of one-upmanship  
it has hit on a situation that many in the audience may find familiar--one that has not been done overly frequently in films  
but the script by jim herzfeld and john hamburg is a little too contrived  
too many coincidences in the story work against greg  
the script could not decide if the main character was incompetent or simply unlucky  
certainly he does not help his situation by doing everything wrong he possibly could , but even when he is trying to do the right things nature conspires against him  
there is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences and human comedy  
certainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written  
the main reason to see meet the parents is to see robert deniro's performance  
deniro plays the suspicious and not a little fascistic father as tightly wound and threatening as he can  
the little judgmental expressions on his face are a show in themselves as greg digs himself deeper and deeper into his insecurities  
but we do not really see much of that digging  
ben stiller is an affable presence in the film but is not really stretching himself by playing the role as the nebbish to whom so many bad things happen  
it is nice to see blythe danner again on the screen  
but her character has a basic conflict between a basic decency and her love for her husband and the script should have given her more to do with that  
randy newman has written a playful score  
in the first few seconds of the film it does something creative i have never heard a film score do before  
there is a lot of source music that is popular music of the 1960s  
presumably that is what the upper class listens to at least in somebody's imagination  
humor is subjective and some this film has been getting some favorable comment  
but this is a comedy that works only occasionally for me  
i would have to rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale "

-1,"it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller  
some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others ( myself included ) would pick seven days in may  
both those films were tense exercises in chills  
the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man , john frankenheimer  
but that was 1962 and 1964 respectively  
for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films , but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed  
each of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot  
they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay  
the thrills all came from the plot  
ronin is like a film made by another man  
somewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot , but we see only tiny pieces of it  
we get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j  d  zeik's screenplay is a bit obscure  
the film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai  
when a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death , he becomes a ronin , much like a gunfighter in the american west  
if you miss the opening , do not worry  
this film will explain again what a ronin is  
sam ( played by robert de niro ) is the modern equivalent of a ronin  
he is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer  
he clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france  
sam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre ( natascha mcelhone of the truman show ) , an irish woman , to be part of an action to steal a mysterious metal case  
dierdre is very tight-lipped about what is in the case  
sam joins a team of four others : vincent ( jean reno of the professional/leon and mission impossible ) , spence ( sean bean , tv's richard sharpe , and also patriot games and goldeneye ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting )  
also along is larry ( skipp suddeth )  
the group seems to know their business , particularly sam , but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise  
their only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team  
the story is not very easy to follow  
it is never clear who is double-crossing whom and who is working for whom  
somehow russians ( who may or may not be the russian mafia ) and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case  
some very good actors are involved in this film  
one wonders what they saw in the script  
the characters are mostly one-dimensional professional killers  
they know their work , and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film , but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed  
by the end of the film we never really got to know anybody  
maybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts , since these are not very demanding characters to create  
in addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale ( the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal )  
as a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s , i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy  
unfortunately there are no deep characters , and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it "
-1,"the classic story & the production which ruined it 
marking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 h  g  wells classic , new line cinema , armed with a stellar cast and expert make-up effects man stan winston ( alien , predator , terminator etc ) churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel  
of course , the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies , one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 , under the title the island of lost souls ( sounds like a much better title   )  
the story begins with edward douglas ( thewlis ) , a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific , who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery ( kilmer ) after his plane crashes into the sea  
douglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr  moreau , who incidently , owns the island and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize  
his host's reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreau's lab , when a monstrous birth was in progress  
even worse , the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal "" people  "" 
douglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beast-people community , which considers dr  moreau their maker  
using shock-therapy and the law , dr  moreau has long been able to keep his beast-people civilised to some extent but there are a few animal-men who are just too savage to be controlled  
the island of dr  
moreau questions the ability of men playing god  
dr  moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings which is free from hate and violence    but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long  
moreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp  
even so , the production has failed to make the most out of it  
there are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is , the characters are not "" prioritized "" so when the audience is led to believe that a particular character is important , before they know it , he or she or it perishes     rather 
ungloriously at times too  
perhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people , especially aissa ( balk ) , the most human of moreau's creations  
the two very important characters , montgomery and dr  moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably  
more screen time could have been used for character interaction and development  
i really would have liked it better if , say , they delved more into dr  moreau's obsession , montgomery's purpose in the story and justification to as why the beast-people had to rebel  
maybe the nature of the screenplay , which incidently , does not incorporate much action sequences in the film , forced the filmmakers to "" cut a long story short "" and make it more of an action film than anything else ( it's still summer , and movies have to be "" marketable "" )  
the special effects too , are really nothing for anyone to shout about  
at most , i would say the beast-men looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes

but it doesn't really make much of a difference  
deep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997  
remember when dante's peak came out in february ? 
a few months later , volcano was released  
the first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen  
the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent  
well , it's deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition  
this time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july  
of course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante's peak  
but while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film  
apparently many did , and it utterly baffles me  
to be completely honest , i haven't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life  
volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch  
deep impact doesn't just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot  
the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters  
deep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 )  
a line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above  
among these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski )  
leo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds  
he races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident  
a year passes , and nothing is heard about it again  
we are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc  
she gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell )  
she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie  
after talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help  
luckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain "" ellie "" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film    
that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled )  
before she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road  
they take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman )  
beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference  
naturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question  
and so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive  
they announce a plan called "" ark , "" which is their only hope for survival  
a computer will select 800 , 000 people at random  
these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won't kill off the entire human race "
-1,"`the skulls' is a laughably bad thriller , a teen-orientated doppelganger of `the firm' so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor  
certain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter  
i chuckled incessantly , all the way home  
let me share  
the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale ( designed , i'm sure , to mirror the actual skull & bones from the same college )  
luke mcnamara ( joshua jackson ) , a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year , highlights the latest skull scouting report  
despite some anxiety and caution from others , luke accepts entry into the organization  
soon after , he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women , driving a new car and marveling at the $20 , 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account  
yeah , dude , pretty good deal eh ? 
but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating ; when circumstances become extreme , there is no way he can leave the society - except maybe as a drooling vegetable  
the premise , although lacking in originality , certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense  
unfortunately , `the skulls' is neither intriguing , nor suspenseful , nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting  
it's just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack , the stars     
but not the script  
`the skulls' is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value , with the screenplay , by jon pogue , immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers  
first off , upon their initiation into the skulls , each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm  
afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar  
will they never take this watch off ? 
and what if they forget it by their bedside ? 
perhaps their ? secret' society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed  
on top of this , they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters  
gee , why not member t-shirts ? 
but my favorite bit is this : the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual ? agree' or ? disagree' notions when making collective decisions  
they are given official skull paddles  
when flipped to one side , they indicate the member agrees with the proposal  
facing the opposite way means a disagreement  
wouldn't they merely express themselves verbally ? 
hell no  
they have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote , and maybe afterward they can play ping-pong  
i'm still chuckling about these ludicrous details , but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest  
the cast , meanwhile , combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the `dawson's creek' crowd , and fuses the two together , ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout  
but not entirely  
accomplished actors like craig t  nelson ( as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake ) and william peterson ( as fellow board member senator levritt ) are dealt pathetic villain caricatures , and look suitably embarrassed handling them  
and then there's christopher mcdonald , who has the capacity to be a fun , exciting actor  
mcdonald's charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role ( yes , pogue makes it a hat-trick )  
i pray it was a `snatch-the-paycheck-and-run' exercise for all these actors  
the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better  
let's cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character  
paul walker , the strapping quarterback from `varsity blues' , is bland but passable as caleb mandrake - the judge's son  
walker preserves a straight face , even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie ( `dad , i just killed a guy in the ritual room ! ' ) "

-1,"written by alex cox , tod davies , terry gilliam and tony grisoni 
directed by terry gilliam 
i've always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid  
dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded ; you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are , no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat , and no idea how long the ride will last  
then there's the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine-laced dose  
mushrooms , on the other hand , offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel : a steady , reassuring assent , a short period of thrilling motion and color , and then a smooth landing  
acid is for daredevils ; mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy  
my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas , director terry gilliam has made an acid movie , when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie  
full of shocking sight gags , aggressive images and grotesque comic performances , the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s  thompson's book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world-view from the inside out  
but for those of us who just want to enjoy a well-made film , gilliam has produced a mixed bag  
fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self-professed "" gonzo "" journalist hunter s  thompson ( johnny depp ) and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta ( benicio del toro ) , came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorney's convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971  
operating under the pseudonyms of "" raoul duke "" and "" dr  
gonzo "" , the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender , then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite , cocaine , tequila and a rainbow of multi-colored uppers and downers  
they terrorize every one they meet , mostly because every one they meet terrifies them  
duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town , then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge  
dr  gonzo becomes enamored of a thick-bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane's "" white rabbit "" reaches its climax  
and these guys don't just trash hotel rooms - they rape them , humiliate them and leave them for dead  
that neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence , depending on your point of view  
thompson's book , besides being a hilarious read , has stood the test of time as an important historical document  
it simultaneously exposed the 60's drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die  
pontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson's message , but the truth is that , stripped to its bare essentials , what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy  
it's a cheech and chong movie  
you're there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results : see johnny take drugs , see johnny fall down  
there's nothing wrong with this concept , but gilliam tries too hard  
this is a frantic movie - all sweaty close-ups , wide-angle lenses , dutch tilts and other-worldly lighting schemes  
there are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen  
but to what end ? 
much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson's book , and there are some priceless comic observations  
but you're hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work  
this brings us to the performances , which strike me as all wrong  
depp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c  scott in patton - a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson's dialogue  
in between his several puking scenes , del toro fares better as dr  gonzo , but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost  
watching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago , with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads - now that would have been something to see  
it's interesting to note that alex cox , credited as a co-writer on the screenplay , was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over  
as much of a fan as i am of gilliam's work , cox would have been the better choice  
sid and nancy , cox's best work , covered essentially the same subject matter , but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film  
gilliam commits the compound sin of over-directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose "

take for example "" casablanca  "" 
great film , even today  
it's still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic  
another example would be "" star wars , "" which had a very , very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion times before  
but as i rewatched "" independence day "" when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996 , i kinda felt like it wasn't as cool as when i had first seen it  
i had liked it when i saw it the first time ( * * * was my original view ) and basically saw it as a good "" escape film  "" 
but when i rewatched it , i felt cheated  
thus , the curse of the "" event film  "" 
 "" independence day "" is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once ( except for a couple kids - the critics , in this situation )  
but after a while , this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one  
well , this kid is the "" event film "" in my little analogy  
and when i rewatched "" independence day , "" not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen , but i felt insulted the whole time  
there are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just aren't sure if it's comedy or hokey drama  
one scene , you'll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch ; the next you'll see a bunch of military uptight guys walking around , saying corny lines  
the worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of "" glen or glenda ? "" 
now this annoying kid's problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once , he shows he has no balls  
and "" independence day "" has no balls  
it plays it safe everywhere  
it throws in a ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films  
the chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of "" star wars  "" 
i mean , isn't that devil's den ? 
and the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moore's breasts in "" striptease  "" 
they're these octopus men , boring freaking octopus men  
i mean , come on  
the aliens in "" 2001 "" were more interesting and you didn't even see them ! 
basically the plot is straight from a b-movie from the 50s : aliens come to earth and we wonder if they're hostile or peaceful  
okay , it's an interesting topic , but it's not handled greatly  
now they aren't and somehow a computer geek , jeff goldblum , figure out they're using our satellites as a countdown to destruction  
yep  
these aliens are not only heavily armed , they're stupid too  
they also use the same kind of computer as we do , but that comes about later  
the president ( bill pullman ) , who's under attack for being a wimp , decides this would be a nice time to be belligerent , and he decides he'll stay in the white house which the aliens have covered  
i don't care if it's bob freaking dole in the white house , get him out of there  
i don't care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol , just get him out of there  
later on , he's stupid and wants to fly in the attack on a big alien ship  
i think it's time for impeachment for this guy  
he's more senile than reagan on pot  
then there's a cocky pilot ( will smith ) who is the only person to survive the counter-attack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area 51 ( the film's only sign of being brave )  
his girlfriend's a stripper sharing a subplot with "" striptease "" in that she has to do it for her son  
come on , she has a fighter pilot boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance  
i think she can quit that job and get a more respectable job at long john silvers "

-1,"when respecting a director , you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect  
woody allen has made a couple less-than good films , and he's my favorite  
even martin scorsese hasn't had a perfect track record  
kevin smith , after a smashing debut with the classic "" clerks "" stooped as low to sell-out and make the dreadful "" mallrats  "" 
i mean , so far the only director who's made several films , none of which have been bad is richard linklater ( "" slacker , "" "" dazed and confused , "" "" before sunrise , "" and "" suburbia ""    all 
which were great )  
now , i adore quentin tarantino  
his first two films were classic films , the second one being one of the greatest films of all time  
but 1995 just wasn't that good of a year for him  
he made way too many tv appearances  
he mispronounced jackie chan's name on the mtv movie awards  
and he made this film  
 ( he was also awarded an oscar , so i guess that would be a grand exception )  
robert rodriguez is also a great director ; not a brilliant one , but a cool one  
i've never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film , so i can't comment on them  
but in this crap ensemble director's film , all four give pitiful efforts  
pitiful for any director , too  
now in all fairness , ensemble director pieces never really work out  
i've never seen all of "" new york stories , "" but have heard the first two films , by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap ( i saw woody's one , which was hilarious but not totally up to par )  but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film  
exposition : a simple one - a bellhop , ted ( the totally overdone tim roth , who's a god and all , but not in this one , though he has a couple good moments ) is working on new year's eve for his first shift ( ! ! ! ) in an old fancy hotel  
he's the only one there ( again : ! ! ! ) and he only has a couple rooms ( yet again : ! ! ! )  
the old bellhop ( the seemingly immortal marc lawrence - who hated pulp fiction actually ) hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily  
as the night goes on , he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile  
yea  
 ( the short films are presented in order , btw ) : 
the missing ingredient writer/director : allison anders starring : sammi davis , amanda decadenet , valeria golino , madonna , ione skye , lili taylor , alicia witt 
this one starts it off horribly with no plot , no intrigue , and crap dialogue  
the situation is so terrible that it's physically painful to watch  
the plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is ( gasp ! ) 
stuck inside some object in their hotel room  
the witch that was supposed to bring it ( ione skye ) calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it  
yeah , that's what i said  
stupid plot , inane characters who aren't interesting at all , etc , etc , etc  the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which , in turn , it wastes pitifully  
not even actually funny for a second  
my rating ( out of 5 ) : no stars ! ! ! ! 
the wrong man writer/director : alexandre rockwell starring : david proval , jennifer beals and laurence bender 
another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on  
ted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple ( david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at "" coming back "" ) who are playing sex games  
ted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon  
but at least this has a bit of comedy in it , just not that much "

-1," "" first rule of fight club is , don't talk about fight club  "" 
this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , it's not even worth mentioning  
director david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge  
with crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i'm surprised i didn't walk out  
this just goes to show that hype kills  
it's very rare that a film so hyped up as "" fight club "" turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception  
the story goes like this  
edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter )  
norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended  
apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain  
why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse  
norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it's on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt )  
the two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight  
how do they come up with this stuff ? 
anyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser's attention , and a club is formed  
out of all this mess , there manages to lie a message  
fincher shows us that society is like robots  
we work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out  
our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others  
call me crazy , but this is common knowledge  
i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably  
even with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story  
i couldn't help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp  
it just shows how desperate the script is for attention  
i guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself  
his bothersome and depressing character , made me disgusted at his 20 million fee  
it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more  
helena bonham carter however really had no purpose  
she just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left  
this continues for what seems like 6 hours  
the film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while "" fight club "" nears what i think might be the end  
unfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom  
though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace  
on a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer  
fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson  
concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , won't do any good if everything else is in need of support  
also , i'm afraid that immature men might respond to the film's violence  
the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult  
when the film ends , i'm just glad to get home and take some advil  
you'll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton when he says "" this is so f * * * ing stupid "
-1,"my inner flag was at half-mast last year when nick at nite pulled "" dragnet "" reruns off the air  
sure , i'd seen them all at least once , but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra-serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv  
even though "" dragnet "" is out of circulation at the moment , we webb anti-fans still have the d  i  , a 50's propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous "" blue boy "" episode of "" dragnet  "" 
for anyone like me who got laughs out of webb's rapid-fire speeches and straight-faced seriousness , think of the d  i  
as what would happen if sgt  
joe friday ever enlisted , because he plays exactly the same character here , a no-nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long- winded , melodramatic speeches on any topic  
in this election year , i'm more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth  
the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb's office door and enters  
he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up  
the "" produced and directed by jack webb "" card pretty much goes without saying  
this is his movie all the way , and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason , i was wondering if there would even be a plot  
i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants , but the d  i  
gives us more -- much more  
webb's mission is to make a man out of private owens , the local screw-up  
the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or , the captain will "" personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself  "" 
 ( whether the "" lace panties "" part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered  ) 
this , of course , gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens' life a living hell  
for those of you who haven't been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching , here's a reprint of a typical monologue of his  
i can't duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper , but the words should at least partially convey what i'm talking about    
 "" now you listen to me , youngster  
someday you'll wake up fighting on a beach and you'll pray to god somebody doesn't get killed because of your foolishness    
i've got a headline for you : every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours , you're gonna turn around and i'll be standing right there  "" 
i couldn't write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d  i  
 ( nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame ) , but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines , like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day's work by going to the local bar ( where he orders a tomato juice )  
he meets a woman who , coincidentally , also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typically-stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch-rival , another marine d  i  
webb marches over to the table , gets up in her face and says , "" just what kind of a dame do you think you are ? "" 
bogart he ain't  
the other d  i  
gets one of the few memorable non-webb lines when he confesses to the girl , "" he's a damn good d "

the teenage romance  
an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies , and in the end , the guy always gets the girl  
and with the arrival of the breakout hit `she's all that' last year ( followed by a long catalogue of imitators including `10 things i hate about you' and `drive me crazy' ) , the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity  
along now comes `down to you'  
the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid `she's all that' craze with their latest project , which has the studdly freddie prinze jr  attached and all  
only `down to you' doesn't have the ? unlikely scenario' mentioned above  
it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance - a dull , unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we're accustomed to  
this is the kind of romance that only giggly 12-year old girls will find convincing  
in strictly textbook fashion , college sophomore and aspiring chef al ( prinze jr  ) meets freshman artist imogen ( julia stiles )  
they hit it off like a couple can only in the movies  
from here , it's the standard boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-drinks-entire-bottle-of-shampoo-and-may-or-may-not-get-girl-back story  
the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters , who are frequently taking part in activities that     
well , only happen in the movies  
fortunately , the cast of `down to you' has a certain appeal  
freddie prinze jr  and julia stiles are an adorable couple , and when on screen together , they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around  
zak orth , as the newly realized porn star monk , shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film's intelligent dialogue  
rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy ( `the faculty' ) , selma blair ( `cruel intentions' ) and ashton kutcher ( tv's `that 70's shows' )  
even the fonz himself - henry winkler , the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia - has a welcome role as al's dad , the host of the popular cooking program `chef ray'  
maybe the concept of `down to you' looked good on paper to draw such a crowd  
as a feature film , however , the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely  
perhaps worst of all , `down to you' is not funny  
the jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired  
the characters on screen , often laughing at each other's goofy/embarrassing antics , seemed far more amused than the audience  
even the giggly 12-year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run it's course  
the one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr  in a fantasy sequence called `cooks' , a `cops' take-off in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for ? needy' families ( with the assistance of a fully-armed swat team , of course )  
when this is the highlight reel , you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired  
in order to make a teen comedy work , you've got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity  
`10 things i hate about you' actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards , and the result was refreshing  
no such luck with `down to you'  
it's just a textbook romance where , despite absurd circumstances , everything is bound to work out in the end  
and at the end of the whole clich ? d ordeal , the nicest thing you could possibly say would be ` "

-1,"dear god , this is a fantastically bad film ! 
regardless of what i say about knock off , you can't grasp its awfulness from my words  
you have to see it and experience it for yourself  
here's the kicker , though -- i suggest that you do so  
yes , this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure  
in fact , i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time , despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story  
don't get me wrong : i'm not excusing knock off  
it reaches an unacceptable level of badness ; it's so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was  
it also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon , michael wong , paul sorvino , and -- of course -- jean-claude van damme  
it does , however , have the entertaining presence of rob schneider , and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark  
as i watched it , i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness  
now , in retrospect , it seems clear that it wasn't , but it's still a fascinating kind of mess  
i don't like writing plot descriptions ( it is , by far , the most boring part of writing a review ) , but , in this case , i'm off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off  
for the sake of comparison , i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing  
i paid closer attention to knock off , and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray , and is accused by the cia ( i think ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are , of course , products that look like name-brand materials but are generic and cheap )  
i don't know what any of this has to do with martial arts , but there are lots of martial arts in the film  
ray is good at martial arts , so when he has to beat up bad guys , there's no problem  
rob schneider plays his sidekick , although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film  
lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff , while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once ! 
in fact , every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do  
in that order , knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense  
but what a strange mess it is  
it was written by stephen e  de souza , who also wrote die hard and 48 hours  
can this be the same man ? 
i don't see how , unless , of course , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time  
knock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go ) , but there's no semblance here  
for instance , van damme is introduced , and then seconds later he's running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong  
why ? 
who knows  
what are the implications of this ? 
i have no idea  
most action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem  
knock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut  
the acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity  
sorvino , in addition , deserves better than this  
van damme is bad , but he's charming in that bad way , and so i can't say that he's hard to watch ( although i rarely understood what he was saying )  
the only exception is rob schneider , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time  
tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison  
they're all pointless gimmicks though , such as shots of the inner-workings of a knock off running shoe  
but his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ? ) is well-choreographed  
lots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy , such as our heroes' first encounter with the rochon character  
but did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous ? 
i hope he did , for the alternative is a frightening thought  
knock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania "

-1,"wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day ? provided , of course , that you're the victim of a frontal lobotomy  
there is , in fact , no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at : movie-goers in their late teens and early twenties -- the most lucrative target group  
this is film noir for the mtv generation : fast-paced , slick , flashy , gleefully mindless , and hollow to the core  
wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998  
i've seen more convincing drama ( with nearly as much bare flesh ) on that pinnacle of narrative quality , baywatch  
wild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it's a thriller with a real story  
what it is , however , is a series of increasingly- improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists  
everything in between those serpentine moments is filler -- a flash of a breast , a spatter of blood , and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie  
the film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess -- just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen , and that will probably be it  
using this approach , i was right three times and wrong only once  
that's not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what's around the next corner  
the ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie : the hot , young cast and the old standby , sex  
both have an abundance of screen time , although i'll admit that the film's erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected  
nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu ?  
the soft-core sex sequences are generic , and don't generate much heat  
the lesbian kisses can't hold a candle to those in bound  
theresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances ( neve campbell , possessing an iron-clad "" no nudity "" clause in her contract , keeps her clothes more or less on )  
the film's greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower  
maybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully-clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick ( mrs  
kevin bacon ) is familiar with  
the director of wild things is john mcnaughton , whose last effort was the finely-tuned psychological thriller , normal life  
that movie featured copious sex , a pair of real characters , and a powerful script  
it's difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker  
but i suppose we all need to put food on the table  
mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here , in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success ( his previous wide-release picture , mad dog and glory , was a box-office disappointment )  
quick cuts and pretty sunrises can't even begin to cover up this movie's flaws  
the main character ( and i use that term lightly , since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality ) is sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a guidance counselor at florida's blue bay high school  
a student , the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , has a crush on him  
one afternoon , she comes to his house to wash his car , and , when she leaves , her clothing is torn  
after confessing to her mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped , she goes to the police station , where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega )  
they are skeptical about here claims until another girl , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , comes forward with a similar tale  
meanwhile , sam , convinced that he's being set up , goes to a shyster lawyer ( bill murray ) for help  
the acting in wild things isn't very good , but none of the principals have much to work with  
this is definitely not a character- based motion picture  
not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a triple-digit i  q  , but it doesn't bother to give any of the on-screen individuals even a hint of depth  
the men and women populating the picture are there to look nice , but nothing more  
matt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps "
-1,"in the james bond film "" diamonds are forever , "" tiffany case asks 007 whether he prefers brunettes to redheads  
bond's response is that it doesn't really matter , as long as collars and cuffs match  
well , collars and cuffs don't match in "" the real blonde  "" 
what might have sounded good on paper ends up as a largely unfunny , meandering comedy on screen  
the film , supposedly a satire of the superficiality of soap operas and the modeling business , is wafer thin  
it plays like an "" ally mcbeal "" episode dragged out to the nth degree , replete with a few unnecessary "" fantasy "" sequences  
writer/director tom dicillo manages the material as if poking fun at daytime dramas is a fresh idea  
it isn't  
the only surprise here is that the talented dicillo could make familiar terrain so dreary  
matthew modine plays joe , a struggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent  
he's 35 with no agent and no credits since he's too proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas  
 "" that's not really acting "" he tells his girlfriend of six years , mary ( catherine keener ) , with whom he bickers constantly about sex  
but they need the money , so joe finally agrees to take a part in a madonna video  
but it's not really madonna starring in the video but a lookalike ( played by elizabeth berkley , still trying to jump-start her career after "" showgirls "" )  
this points out how artificial this whole business is , one supposes  
dicillo has referred to "" the real blonde "" as "" off-kilter , but an interesting combination of all sorts of stuff    "" 
the film , which wanders all over the place without getting anywhere , is remarkably * on * -kilter and , with perhaps the single exception of the always-likable modine ( who's not afraid to stand around in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks ) , the entire cast is vague and uninteresting  
catherine keener , who's appeared in dicillo's previous three films ( including the brilliant "" living in oblivion "" ) , is at her most annoying in "" the real blonde  "" 
look at her closely ; she really can't act at all  
her reactions are all wrong , almost always out of sync with her co-stars  
she reacts too soon , or too late , to lines and situations  
she moves her eyes , or her mouth , far too much  
she frowns , she yells , she babbles--she blows chunks  
maxwell caulfield plays joe's actor/waiter buddy bob , the one obsessed with dating a "" natural "" blonde  
bob's personality ( not to mention caulfield's acting ability ) parallels that of the character he plays on the soap opera "" passion crest "" --stiff and uninteresting  
maybe that's the point  
daryl hannah is dim and uninteresting as the real blonde of the title , a soap dish who beds bob both on- and off-camera  
hannah looks about fifty in this movie ( she's only 37 )  
why is that ? 
almost all the women in the film wear tops that show their nipples  
why is that ! ? 
marlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer  
kathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent  
buck henry plays an uninteresting shrink  
christopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer  
and so on  
the best parts of the "" the real blonde "" are the beginning and the end , brief scenes of an elderly woman losing and then finding her dog  
there's more depth and sincerity in a single close-up of her expressive face than in the entire film  
while this contrast is supposedly meant to highlight the shallowness of the other characters' lives , the only thing that makes shallow and superficial interesting is if it's funny "

-1,"200 cigarettes takes place on new year's eve 1981  
monica , played by martha plimpton is having a huge new year's party  
everyone in town is trying to get there , but some are caught up in other things  
this is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes  
as we meet the characters headed towards the party , we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal , and not interesting at all  
this disappointed me greatly  
the film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion  
lucy , played by courtney love , is with kevin , played by paul rudd  
the two are in a relationship that is more of a friendship , but starts to blossom into something more than that  
this subplot is extremely boring and dull , and i am getting quite sick of plots like that  
janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot , dealing with kevin  
she plays ellie , an ex-girlfriend of kevin's  
this subplot is completely a waste of garofalo's talent  
there was no point to it at all , and it was hardly even in the movie  
when lucy runs into a bartender , played by ben affleck , another subplot is formed  
the bartender is invited by lucy to come to monica's party  
at the bar , he runs into two more girls  
the girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker , but unfortunately , due to the terrible acting of both of them , i don't even remember their characters names  
ben affleck is a good actor , but his character doesn't go anywhere so he doesn't have much screen time to give a good performance  
featherstone and parker are horrible in their roles , and they are part of the reason the film is so bad  
christina ricci plays val , and gaby hoffman plays stephie  
the two girls are trying to get to the party but are extremely lost  
they meet some guys and end up going around with them all night  
this subplot was alright , but it was quite annoying with stephie's accent  
hoffman did an okay job of acting , but ricci did good  
she was underused , considering she is such a wonderful actress  
another subplot in the film is the relationship between cindy , played by goldie hawn's daughter , and jack , played by jay mohr  
jack is an actor who doesn't care about the girls he goes out with , he just likes dates for one night , and the next day he doesn't  
kate hudson is a huge klutz  
she gets herself into very funny situations , that are the funniest parts in the entire movie  
they are probably the only funny parts in the entire movie as well  
this subplot could have been used more , mainly due to hudson's performance  
mohr wasn't good , but he wasn't bad  
he was just alright , which i didn't find acceptable  
there is not much to say about the performances in the film  
none of the characters are developed or shown enough to really tell if the acting is good or not  
the only performances that i can judge are christina ricci's as always good performance , kate hudson's funny role , courtney love's mediocre performance , and paul rudd's annoying and overused performance  
i was hoping for a little more out of jaw mohr , ben affleck , casey affleck , gaby hoffman , dave chapelle , and especially out of janeane garofalo  
the two strongest things in the film were the great soundtrack and the original costumes "

-1,"i am a steven seagal fan  
i only say this now because "" mufti splenetik "" isn't my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things  
any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on  
seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue , heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones ( which we'll always hear when seagal does his limb-twisting thing ) , rarely a female co-lead in sight ( unless it's a real-life model-wife who hasn't worked since weird science ) and , usually the worst possible titles you can imagine  
not to mention very straightforward plots , generally all-round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather-face himself in that same black outfit he's been in since nico doing his "" my hands are sharp , nimble knives "" thing , seagal the stoic , sir petrified ponytail , duke of dull  
in the glimmer man , seagal breaks out of this formula : he gets a * sidekick * , attempts to banter , and puts on a new vest  
he's also put on quite a lot of weight  
small potatoes , you may say , a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to , but damnit , if it ain't broke , why fix it ? 
 ( more on this disappointed person's dashed expectations later )  
as jack cole , seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past  
while he and his partner ( played by keenen ivory wayans ) are investigating a series of ritual killings , cole himself becomes a suspect , especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole  
it turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin ( you just can't trust these homicide detectives ) , someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them , and hence , well , you know , that "" glimmer man "" thing  
an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger , more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman ( bob gunton ) , cole's former cia boss ( brian cox ) and deals involving chemical weapons  
the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff , drawing ( as with his other films ) elements from the hotter films of the year ( eg , se7en )  
it's the other changes that disappoint  
for example , although there's a fair amount of violence in this movie , there's also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans , probably the best known of the wayans tribe ( how many are there , exactly ? ) from television's "" in living colour  "" 
wayans plays whiney straightman to seagal's bead-adorned and brocade-draped cole , keeping up his "" are you crazy "" part of the dialogue with wasted zest  
as campbell , wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner's eccentric habits , but the chemistry between the two is minimal , and seagal's wooden comebacks make for painful watching  
a cook in under seige 2 , seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble  
he chants , refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies  
again , a benign ( if trite ) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual  
heck , he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film  
is that a lot to ask of the seague ? 
too much  
seagal's best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies : to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages , and to do it silently , and alone  
not for seagal , the snappy one-liners of arnold and stallone , nor the attempts to show that he can act , much less think  
no kindergarten cop , no oscar , just simple , unadulterated deathblows  
that's really how it must have started : like-minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing , knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else  
we trusted him  
we got to know him  
now , betrayal  
i don't know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he's going to try to be funny again  
i'll try , but it won't be easy  
if you haven't watched the glimmer man yet , you might want to wait for the video to come out  
it's easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences  
after all , if we can't depend on our fantasies , what can we depend on ? 
the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast  
 * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 
 * * * pretty good , bring a friend  
 * * * * amazing , potent stuff  
 * * * * * perfection  
see it twice

-1,"my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love  
i love ralph fiennes  
i love uma thurman  
i love sean connery  
hell , i'm even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw  
i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i've been eagerly awaiting the film ever since  
a few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground  
then , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics  
and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs  
and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique  
my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things  
the film i saw today didn't even meet those expectations  
this is a lousy , incoherent mess  
i would slam it harder , if it weren't for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors  
but sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired  
that's the main problem with the avengers : for all it's hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired  
it's like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making  
it also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots  
this is just plain depressing  
the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show  
frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i've never watched an episode  
i wasn't alive then  
i don't even watch television now  
i'm very sorry that i don't have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i've already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse  
i didn't know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles  
i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film  
based on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr  peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits  
they are to work together , under mother's orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw )  
it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather  
his name is de wynter ( connery )  
he is a crazy scottish guy  
our heroes had better stop him , or else  
  
  
the weather will keep getting colder until they "" have to go to hell to warm up "" ( one of the film's few funny lines )  
along the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense  
for example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos  
now , killer bugs don't really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film "

-1,"there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors  
when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture  
you see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries  
i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories  
i hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac's shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey  
the badness of patch adams is stupefying  
it's confounding  
i can't believe a film can be this bad  
and yet , it's based on a real man who probably has a good point to make  
in the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human  
in the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn't want to kill himself  
while there , he notices that the doctors don't care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings  
so , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients  
he goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it's good to help people  
he also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor  
naturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams  
so patch decides that he's going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have  
and that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998  
on a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn't say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter's performance , even if she is wasted )  
but the film fails fundamentally in execution  
every scene swells with grand , "" emotional "" music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard  
take , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus  
we don't know patch yet , but there's sad music , and it's supposed to make us really sad that he's sad  
later on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively  
and when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad  
but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions  
real drama is character-based  
you grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it  
we don't ever grow to know the dying patient ; he's simply a vehicle for patch's greatness  
real drama doesn't seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry  
that's why patch adams is not real drama  
it goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene  
even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman's sickening musical score  
sentimentality like this is indeed bad  
but it's not as bad as half-baked , simplistic themes  
you see , patch is a really great student  
he aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he's cheating  
but patch doesn't think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor  
 "" why don't we see patients until the third year ? "" he bursts out every three seconds "

i once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person's brain with microwaves  
then i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections  
i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted  
these people had what are known as "" conspiracy theories "" - ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public  
a little imagination goes a long way  
in richard donner's conspiracy theory , jerry fletcher ( mel gibson ) is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything  
his latest , that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle , might sound outrageous to us , but is all in a day's work for him  
he combs the newspaper , looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings-on behind the scenes , and from there jerry draws his conclusions  
upstanding citizen that he is , he tries to convince alice sutton ( julia roberts ) of the justice department that the president must be warned  
lucky gal , alice , who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since  
what she doesn't know is that jerry's interest in her is far more than , well , professional  
he goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment  
but when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry's ideas and his limited-circulation "" conspiracy theory "" newsletter , he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice's help  
one of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action-thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action , nor a significant number of thrills  
part of this is a result of the film's slow pace  
it takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice , and even once that is over with , the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement  
at over two hours , this film could have been significantly condensed and had it's running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour , but even then , the action scenes would not be able to save the film  
instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces , we're treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite "" black elements "" : black helicopter , men in black action suits and body armor , black vehicles - you know the drill  
they come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons , but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time  
big deal , we've seen it all before  
watching the film , i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination , but i was out of luck  
now , when i say it took forever to set up the "" relationship "" between jerry and alice , i completely mean what one person is relative to the other , and not romantic involvement  
oh , donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie , the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other , but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring  
you see , there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies ( also directed by donner ) than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory  
the two just don't click , and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether ( like finding out he's been stalking her ) , the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced  
the script in general also seems forced , like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it , then took it and forced it upon us  
dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening  
even gibson's usual gift for ad lib couldn't punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest , although one of jerry's theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing  
unfortunately , much of what's discussed in the film is not inherently important to what's going on , but instead filler that starts out with potential , but ends up just being extraneous because it's never followed through  
for example , jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station  
he even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break ( hence the water in a subway station ) , and that the coroner should check the man's lungs for chlorine  
this is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him  
you know what happens then ? 
nothing , zip , nada  
no follow-up whatsoever , so what's the significance ? 
okay , here's another one  
a couple of well known ( real life ) assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j  d  salinger novel "" the catcher in the rye ""  
jerry also has a bunch of copies "

i was truly convinced that "" wild wild west "" marked 1999 studio filmmaking at its most hapless , but then along comes "" end of days "" to prove me wrong  
this big budget , brain dead apocalyptic thriller bludgeons its audience with overwrought music , grisly violence , explosions galore and lots of cheesy special effects  
the result ? 
nothing but groans and yawns  
even the devil himself is unable to produce a decent scare in this festival of the inept  
at the very least , "" end of days "" should have done us the courtesy of being bad-enough-to-be-good , but it can't even manage that  
it's just lousy  
arnold schwarzenegger , still recovering from heart problems and "" batman & robin , "" plays an ex-cop turned security agent or bodyguard or something  
along with his obligatory comic relief partner ( kevin pollak , impersonating matthew perry's chandler character from "" friends "" ) , he gets involved in some major league supernatural hoodoo  
it seems that satan ( gabriel byrne ) gets a shot at world domination only once every thousand years ( and here i thought he'd pulled it off with the republican landslide of '94 )  
if he has sex with 20-year old christine york ( robin tunney ) , "" the chosen one , "" their child will be the antichrist , or at least a brat  
ah , but this deal has more catches than a new year's eve pass from a halfway house  
the unholy union must take place on december 31 , 1999 ( you see , 999 is just 666 turned upside down ) , but only between 11 p  m  and midnight ( no wonder this guy is so cranky )  
and if the chosen one is given refuge in a church , the devil won't know where she is , because he can't see into the sanctuary  
you know , it's kind of like superman's x-ray vision and lead walls , only evil  
a group of guerrilla catholic priests decide the best way to stop the situation is by killing the girl  
arnold chooses to save the girl and kick the hell out of satan , if you'll pardon the expression  
and kevin meets up with an exploding van and has to make some decisions of his own  
oh , the anguish ! 
oh , the humanity ! 
oh , the writing ! 
andrew w  marlowe's screenplay ladles implausibility upon implausibility , from the preposterous otherworldly histrionics to his handling of jericho cane , schwarzenegger's character  
cane starts the film a la mel gibson in the first "" lethal weapon , "" preparing to put a gun in his mouth due to ongoing despondence over the murder of his wife and daughter  
twenty minutes later , he's racing through the bowels of new york city , deciphering clues that sherlock holmes and kreskin would find baffling  
when cane meets up with christine york , he instantly switches to terminator father figure mode , with the young woman serving as surrogate daughter  
in case anyone misses the connection , the camera comes in for a close up of christine's music box , which just happens to be identical to one owned by cane's daughter  
subtle , marlowe , subtle  
speaking of cameras , director peter hyams is just the man to take marlowe's script and make it even more self-important , murky and annoying  
hyams' direction shows all the subtlety of a gwar video , with cane running a gauntlet of ridiculous action set pieces , punctuated with loads of big explosions  
eager to satisfy arnold's core audience , he even throws in a few pairs of breasts as well  
what a guy  
had the film delivered some decent scares , or even maintained a consistently ominous tone , the bombastic clich ? s might have been tolerable , but "" end of days "" is simply a flaccid special effects show  
the cast is just as ineffective  
in his early scenes , gabriel byrne attempts to invest beelzebub with some panache , but he all too soon turns into just another standard issue monster  
kevin pollak comes and goes quickly , robin tunney comes off like a bargain basement winona ryder and as for arnold , well ? he's a better actor than casper van dien  
that should count for something  
way back in the aftermath "" the exorcist "" and "" the omen , "" supernatural swill like "" end of days "" might have passed muster as a b-movie

yes , that's right , he co-wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 ) , the empire strikes back ( 8  5/10 ) and return of the jedi ( 8/10 )  
now with this film , it looks as though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing  
and guess what ? 
he succeeds once again ! 
plot : a man with a shady and regrettable past decides to run away and into a small american town , where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an open-armed swarm of people with problems  
it isn't long before he befriends the small-town billionaire , folks become suspicious and he falls for one of his own patients  
critique : this film is not a comedy ! 
it is a drama  
i say this right up front because from the looks of the trailer , you would think that this film secures its base in humor , but unfortunately for us , it does not  
it is a serious film ( seriously flawed if you ask me , but i digress ) which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake , but overall , just sits there  
now on to my review  
this movie sucks because it was slow and boring , starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past , included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst , and certified it all with many a predictable ending  
i have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture , but whatever it was    he 
missed ! 
anyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puff-piece , which on a good day , might be described as predictably digestible  
it's no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy ! 
it sucks as a drama , and bored my movie cohort right to sleep  
i've given it four points on four extremely shallow yet distinguishable marks  
first of all , i couldn't help but think about how much the lead actor , loren dean , looked like a young charles grodin  
he even acted like him , save for the dry , sardonic wit  
this kept me interested in watching him at least  
number two , and this one is really shallow ( seemed to be geared that way as well ) , there were quite a few "" titshots "" , as they would say back in high school  
and god help me if i can't get enough of those in an aimless drama  
and three , and this one surprised me the most , actor ted danson's cameo ( yes , he will always be sam malone to us real fans ! ) was the best part about this movie and actually made me see him as a different person  
a different asshole , but a different person nonetheless  
if ever you rent this movie one day ( promise you won't throw away your hard-earned money at the theaters ? ! ) , 
wait for his scene because it's actually pretty good  
other than that , drab , drab , drab and drab  
even jason lee , a personal favorite of mine , was left out to dry with lame dialogue and one of the phoniest romances to hit the big screen in a while  
well , at least he finally "" came out "" and did some real skateboarding in this movie ! 
oh yeah , and i guess that's the fourth point in my rating  
anyway , if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about their boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist    this 
film's your bag ! 
otherwise , skip it and see analyze this ( 8/10 ) again    now 
there's a great shrink movie ! 
little known facts about this film and its stars : "" three's company "" fans alert ! ! ! 
terri from the tv show , also known as actress priscilla barnes , plays a small but pivotal part as the landlady in this film  
the scene is actually a fantasy sequence and does feature cleavage , so stay tuned , kids ! 
also , it is to note that the actress was once named "" penthouse pet of the month "" in march of 1976  
she was known as one joann witty back then  
she's originally from jersey  
who the hell is loren dean , the dude who plays mumford in this film ? 
you got me , but all i know is that he was born in las vegas in 1969 and played the character of billy bathgate in the 1991 film of the same name "
-1,
-1,"the last line ( or near to that honor ) is the great butler , alfred ( the ubergod , michael gough ) saying , "" i think we need a bigger bat cave , "" or something to that note  
that's exactly what this film is - too big for its own good because it has too damn much  
cut batgirl out  
cut one of the villains  
it's too much to handle in one dosage  
it's so much that characters get left behind  
poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way , shape or form  
and elle deserves better  
this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher  
it's also the fourth worst in the series ( and second worst from joel )  
the series has been declining since its stunning debut , followed by the almost-as-stunning sequel and then the anti-climactic third one ( first by joel )  
this one's not anti-climactic - i knew it was gonna suck  
it's up to joel to make it fun though  
 "" batman forever "" was fun  
this is a big bore of over-produced action sequences and shallow characters  
i mean , this one bit  
i'm gonna put all the plot in one paragraph : mr  freeze ( ah-nold ) , who's wife was dying of some disease , has become the new big villain these days  
he's a huge ex-scientist who fell into some weird liquid ( hello ? 
joker ? ) and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body  
batman ( george ) and robin ( chris ) fight him a bit but find they're growing apart  
meanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he's used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had  
she emerges from her chemicals ( don't ask 'cause i can't tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who's poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people  
she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo  
meanwhile , alfred's dying of the same disease mr  freeze's wife has ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and his niece , barbara ( alicia ) , comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not really soon , it takes her 2 hours ) becomes batgirl  
meanwhile , in an unfinished subplot , bruce ( batman's alter-ego , if you forgot ) has been dating the lovely julie madison ( the even lovlier elle macpherson ) who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing  
end of her for all we know  
mr  freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population ( don't ask ! ! ! )  
the trio must team together "" as family "" to beat them  
there ya go  
not the whole story but no big context clues  
too much , right ? 
right ! 
the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels  
however , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one  
he gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that's it  
maybe some stunts  
for all this , i can't even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy ! 
and when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say  
i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode  
george is in between them "
-1,"this is an adaptation of h  g  wells' acclaimed novel 'the invisible man'  
the actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue  
the director is paul verhoven  
that , plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer , should be enough to lure us into the theatre  
the problem is to keep us there  
i can't imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time  
working on a top secret military project , sebastian caine ( kevin beacon ) -- an eccentric genius , that calls himself "" god "" , has discovered the secret to invisibility  
the first two faces are completed  
now , it is time for "" the next logical step "" -- human  
caine volunteers for this risky experiment  
but when he is made invisible , something goes wrong  
while his ex-girlfriend linda ( elisabeth shue ) desperately tries to find something to return him to normal , he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower  
but that's not the bad thing -- an unexpected side-effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania  
he is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers , just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine  
soon every sense of decency is forgotten  
the little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien-rip-off , where caine is walking like a half finished terminator , spooking , scaring and killing everybody  
though it's based on a novel called 'the invisible man' , the title has been ironically changed to 'hollow man' that sums up the film very nicely  
this is a very silly production  
laughable , actually  
apparently verhoven's imagination doesn't stretch too far  
for him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls' locker room undetected  
it is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie  
being invisible , gives you the opportunity to be who you are , to do what you want without being influenced by society  
in many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences  
the nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about  
all that , the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat  
caine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man  
but since this is a modernization , in other words a dehumanization , he doesn't stop there  
he becomes a rapist  
and then , of course , a murderer  
you'll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place  
shue's talent is barely seen , josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent  
kevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully  
his face is not seen for the most part of the film , and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice  
there are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing  
in the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place  
being probably the best technical achievement since "" jurassic park "" , they are absolutely amazing "
-1,"in french , the phrase "" film noir "" literally means "" black film  "" 
webster defines it as "" a type of crime film featuring cynical malevolent characters in a sleazy setting and an ominous atmosphere that is conveyed by shadowy photography and foreboding background music  "" 
classic film noir , including such memorable fare as "" the big sleep , "" the original "" cape fear , "" and orson welles' striking "" a touch of evil , "" employed black and white photography to emphasize the long shadows associated with the genre  
color came into play with neo-noir films like "" chinatown "" and "" blade runner  "" 
 "" l  a  confidential , "" easily the best film of 1997 , is a wonderful piece of contemporary neo-noir filmmaking  
for a textbook example of how to take all the elements of neo-noir and create an absolute mess , there's "" palmetto  "" 
based on "" just another sucker , "" a short story written by british author rene raymond under the pseudonym james hadley chase , "" palmetto "" shows what happens when a filmmaker puts style ahead of substance  
director volker schlondorff ( "" tin drum , "" the handmaid's tale "" ) stated "" we weren't even sure for a long time if it was going to be a thriller or a comedy  "" 
it shows  
 "" palmetto "" is too preposterous too be taken seriously as a thriller and too ponderous to work as a comedy  
the story begins when journalist harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is released from prison  
someone turned state's witness and revealed that harry was framed , a "" reward "" for blowing the lid on corruption in the small florida town of palmetto  
bitter and broke , harry plans to hitchhike to miami and start his life over , but ex-girlfriend nina ( gina gershon ) appears to return him to palmetto  
while hanging out at a bar , he notices that a beautiful woman has left her purse in a phone booth  
harry pockets her cash , only to have the woman reappear and catch him with her money in his pocket  
no problem , though  
the radiant blonde is rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue , ) the young wife of a very rich older man with heart problems , and she has a proposition for harry  
rhea needs "" a threatening voice and someone to collect the ransom "" for the staged kidnapping of her teenage stepdaughter odette ( chloe sevigny  ) 
the girls want to bilk a half-million dollar "" ransom "" from the old man and will happily give harry $50 , 000 for helping with the scam  
things go wrong , of course  
odette is found dead , leaving harry frantically trying to dispose of the corpse and cover his tracks  
in an ironic twist , harry is asked to work for the local d  a  's 
office  
they need a press liaison to field questions about odette's kidnapping and feel that harry is the perfect man for the job  
not a bad set-up for a noir film , if only schlondorff knew how to handle the material , but he never settles on a consistent tone  
the actors don't know what to do with their characters either , muddling the proceedings even further  
as if that wasn't enough , the story suffers from major problems in logic  
woody harrelson is a talented actor with an admirable willingness to take on risky parts , but he's lost here  
presented as a crusading journalist who was horribly wronged , it makes no sense that harry would be stupid and dishonest enough to get caught up in this scheme  
harrelson clearly doesn't know what to do with harry's character , so he spends most of the film glowering , sweating and generally acting miserable  
meanwhile , elisabeth shue gives a goofy performance , behaving like a vamp on nitrous oxide  
as the stepdaughter , chloe sevigny lays on so many slurpy quirks that she comes off like juliette lewis jr  despite a number of steamy scenes , there's no chemistry between harrelson and the women  
to make matters worse , schlondorff badly dubs in dialogue while the character's lips are running over each others bodies  
two particularly bad scenes highlight the film's problems  
while driving with a body in his trunk , harry has a minor car wreck and a cop shows up "

he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain  
with teaching mrs  tingle , his directorial debut , williamson has reached the end of his rope  
what used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here  
the components are all there , including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to  
but where are the thrills ? 
the laughs ? 
both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge  
and what a shame that is  
i loved the scream films - heck , i even enjoyed the sci-fi goofiness of the faculty  
kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office  
teaching mrs  tingle , a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers , may put an end to his reign  
or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties  
i still have my faith , but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past  
the title character of his pet project is a vicious , uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over-the-top by british actress helen mirren  
mrs  tingle is basically every student's worst nightmare : a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard-working of her pupils  
the principal ( michael mckean ) is horrified of her , and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members  
i enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way  
mirren's performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink  
in other words , it's a poor substitute for williamson's best work  
the plot is a big problem here  
material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director  
the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann , an over-achiever hoping to get a college scholarship  
but typical mrs  tingle says her history project , which she worked on for countless hours , is laughable  
later on while studying in the gymnasium , a classmate ( barry watson ) offers her a photo-copied duplicate of mrs  tingle's final exam  
leigh ann's best friend ( marisa coughlan ) encourages her to use it  
alas , the old hag herself finds the three scheming , and snatches the test , and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning  
in the morning    
how convenient ! 
the three students head to mrs  tingle's house , attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann's name  
things get out of hand , and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle  
the plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her  
of course , not everything goes entirely to plan  
besides pointless sub-plots involving the football coach ( jeffrey tambor , horribly wasted ) , there is little by way of actual progress "

-1,"i went to blair witch project 2 : book of shadows with the highest of hopes  
the original film , released last summer , was genuinely scary and terrifying ; i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor  
unfortunately , my hopes were soon dashed  
as the movie opens , the audience is shown pseudo-documentary clips of burkittsville , maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie  
it's a mostly humorous , self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film  
during this segment , we are introduced to the protagonist , a young man who sells blair witch-related memorabilia from his website  
the movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously  
we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia , but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies  
we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him  
we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him  
no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution ; in fact , these scenes are barely referred to again  
i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally , a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting , filthy interiors , and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie  
the movie cuts again , this time to the present  
the young man , whose name is jeffrey ( played by jeffrey donovan -- as in the first movie , the character names are identical to the actors' names , although this movie admits up front that it is fictional , so there's no reason for the practice this time around ) , is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the "" blair witch hunt , "" which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website  
we meet tristen and steven , a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience  
steven is a skeptic , believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria  
tristen , on the other hand , believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence  
she is wan and soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly  
 ( she also complains that she feels nauseated ; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant , and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out  
how did i know ? 
because in bad movies , nauseated women are always pregnant  ) 
the fourth member of their party is erica , a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch , not evil  
they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery  
kim is dressed completely in black , has extreme goth-style makeup on , and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities , but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch  
presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; it's never explained  
the party of five heads off into the woods as promised  
they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr's house and set up camp , complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night's events  
there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well , but after a few words are exchanged , the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere  
the movie veers off at this point to spend many long , long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down  
sexual innuendoes are tossed around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consumed , and nothing much else happens  
this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary  
the next day , the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed , and that steven and tristen's manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds , like snow  
the videotapes are missing , but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim , they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house , "" right where the original blair witch tapes were found ! "" 
ooh  
spooky  
the team goes back to jeffrey's house -- a creepy old civil war-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and review the tapes  
they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night  
wacky hijinks ensue  
tristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch , everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on their bodies , steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations , and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket  
throughout the entire ordeal , jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes , which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps ; eventually tristen wanders in , mutters something about "" reverse , "" and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards  
when they do this , they discover what really happened during the five lost hours "

-1,"54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring  
a greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives , flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors  
i , however , would rather cut to the chase  
54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring  
there is nothing in it -- not a glimpse of depth , nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight  
there is no electricity in any of the scenes , or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots  
and it's underdeveloped , and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they're in this year's boogie nights  
they are so wrong  
the picture has been assembled by mark christopher  
based on this film , i don't know how he got a job in the business  
54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name , which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s  
i don't know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released , but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson's brilliant work in every possible way , from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography  
what it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great : depth , intelligence , energy , fascinating characters , and challenging themes  
54 can't even measure up to the last days of disco , which is flawed , but still smart and entertaining  
it's remarkably bad timing , i'd say , to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind  
i have exaggerated , though : there is one interesting character , and one terrific performance  
that character is steve rubell , played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves  
steve rubell is the owner of studio 54 , and if christopher had focused on him , then myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself  
alas , we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane ( ryan phillippe ) , a going-nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club , thanks to rubell's homosexual impulses  
it's here that he meets his friends , the array of uninteresting characters : his co-worker , greg ( brecklin meyer ) , his wife , anita ( salma hayek ) , and , of course , the love interest , julie black ( neve campbell )  
shane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning , and he has a reasonably sturdy home life  
 ( some of the scenes with his father border on interesting , while heather matarazzo , who plays his sister , pushes phillippe off the screen  ) 
but he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene , and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs  
why his "" friends "" push him into drugs is never really explained , but the fact that they are "" friends "" is questioned only is superficial ways ( greg gets really mad at shane because he's been elevated to bartender status )  
there isn't a single conflict that takes center stage , except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works  
most of the film is dumb , and most of the dialogue is inane  
there's a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black , and , in the next scene , they're arm-in-arm without a bit of development  
then , they're kissing in a bowling alley ! 
this is five minutes of material , thrown into the picture at the last minute ( well past the one-hour mark , and this isn't a long film to begin with )  
campbell is a talented actress , but she needs a role that gives her a little depth  
this one doesn't  
and phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever ; this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg's star-making role in boogie nights  
he seems dumb and misguided , and his voice never changes tone  
i guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body , but he seems pretty lanky to me  
he's all wrong for a lead role , but it doesn't help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters  
by the end of 54 , shane's most notable trait is his stupid , fake accent  
the rest of the performances are wasted  
hayek is an energetic , talented young actress , and does almost nothing here  
meyer is endearing , but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard  
only myers , by sheer force of talent , manages to rise above christopher's wading-pool of a script "
-1,"conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that children's items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty-five or thirty years after the item was made  
that's when the kids of that time have jobs , disposable income and a desire to re-visit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives  
check out the prices of toys from the late sixties and you'll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks  
there's a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen  
boomers are now mostly in their forties and fifties and have lived in the work-a-day world for a long time  
they'd like to re-capture some of that fun they remember from days of yore  
hollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them  
directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that time  
and for the most part they're messing it up

none of these successfully capture the originals  
none of these are even good films

super secret agent john steed ( then-patrick macnee ) and his third partner , emma peel ( then-diana rigg ) are the pair that the american audience fell for  
surrealistic and witty , the series fit the mood of the times  
the leather-clad rigg probably didn't hurt the ratings either  
after all it's not a coincidence that you can't pronounce her character's name without "" appeal ""  
now we're in the nineties  
steed ( now-ralph fiennes ) and peel ( now-uma thurman ) are battling evil genius sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) who is screwing with england's weather  
that's about as much of a plot as we have  
there's some footage about a lot of other things that either don't make sense or make even less sense  
we get betrayal for some unknown reason  
evil clones appear and vanish and have no connection to the film  
remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason  
there's a high tech hot air balloon , but i have no idea why anyone's in it  
the spy agency is run by a man called "" mother "" who is in a wheelchair and a woman named "" father "" who is blind    at 
least in some scenes  
there's probably a reason for all of this , but we'll never know it  
macnee makes an appearance of sorts  
he is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing  
a group of villains sits around a table , all clad in huge pastel-colored teddy bear outfits  
at first it's humorous to watch the teddies waddle around , but then it becomes goofy  
the movie is a medley of clutter , confusion and wrong decisions around every corner  
it feels like major portions of the film are missing  
the storyline jumps rather than flows

-1,"and i thought "" stigmata "" would be the worst religiously-oriented thriller released this year  
turns out i was wrong , because while "" stigmata "" was merely boring and self-important , "" end of days "" is completely inept on all fronts  
it's a silly , incomprehensible , endlessly stupid mess  
for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best , it's extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up  
for the first time in recent memory , an arnold action movie ( and "" batman & robin "" doesn't count ) is no fun at all  
 "" end of days "" is a major stinker  
the movie opens in vatican city , 1979  
some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy , which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation  
if he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 , 1999 , the world will be destroyed  
the pope orders protection of this girl , though some priests believe she ought to be killed  
in new york , that very night , a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy  
twenty years later , we meet jericho cane ( schwarzenegger ) , a suicidal ex-cop with a drinking problem  
now working as a security guard for hire , he is protecting a local businessman ( gabriel byrne ) , who is actually possessed by the devil  
an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after , christine york ( robin tunney )  
recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine ( including ownership of the same music box , apparently ) , jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her  
there are so many problems with this film it's hard to know where to begin , but how about starting with the concept ? 
casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with  
schwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea  
arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions  
in other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake  
harrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they've all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger  
there are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho's character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine's location by offering him his old life back  
none of these scenes really work , because arnie isn't up to the task  
the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before  
this one isn't at all believable the way arnold plays him  
the supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all  
as the prince of darkness , he's suave and confident  
he acts like one would expect the devil to act  
the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain  
byrne out-performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil  
byrne's speech about the bible being "" overrated "" actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold's attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the "" 'tis not ! "" 
variety ) are feeble at best  
the only problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares  
kevin pollack plays jericho's security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after about an hour  
robin tunney isn't given much to do except look scared  
in fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , save for byrne , is given anything interesting to do  
performances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it  
this being an action blockbuster , it's no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script , which starts off totally confusing , and when some of it is explained ( and not much of it is ) , it's utterly ridiculous  
why is the devil coming on new year's eve , 1999 ? 
because it's exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which isn't 666 , it turns out  
some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the beginning , and you've got 1999 ! 
if you don't buy this explanation , you're not alone  
it's convoluted and silly at the same time "

-1,"play it to the bone is a punch-drunk mess of a movie  
containing a good cast but awful acting ; an interesting premise but terrible execution , ron shelton ( white men can't jump ) gives us a rocky story with not one rocky but two  
rocky no  1 is vince boudreau ( woody harrelson , edtv ) , a bald , tattooed , newly converted christian , whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as a curse word    
something that he has not yet successfully achieved  
rocky no  2 is caesar dominguez ( antonio banderas , the 13th warrior ) , best friend of vince who is currently dating vince's ex-girlfriend , grace  
both men are nearing the end of their "" almost "" careers when a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity  
when both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated , the fight promoters need to find a quick replacement  
our boys are tapped to fight each other , the winner of which is "" promised "" a shot at a future title fight  
the film is divided into two sections  
at first , we have a buddy road picture as our two heroes , in grace's "" sassy grassy "" green muscle car , travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day  
along the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by  
once in vegas , the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince and caesar  
both mr  harrelson and mr  banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past , not that we'd know it from their work here  
mr  harrelson is uncomfortably awkward , apparently never having gotten a firm handle on vince  
the christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable  
mr  banderas is uncharacteristically non-charismatic as caesar  
weak and ineffectual , there is little life in his screen performance  
the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another  
tom sizemore ( saving private ryan ) , robert wagner ( austin powers ii : the spy who shagged me ) , and richard masur ( fire down below ) are crooked promoters , lucy liu ( payback ) is a sex-starved hitchhiker looking for a good time , and lolita davidovich ( gods and monsters ) , is the shared girlfriend who can't make her mind up which boxer she prefers  
because of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them , the film flounders with all the appeal of a dead fish until the boxing match actually begins  
but even then , because the outcome is so predictably obvious , the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other  
writer/director ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed , well-choreographed , well-edited , and well-performed  
if only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film  
as it is , the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak and laughable  
the title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film  
the phrase , "" play it to the bone' is a reference to seeing something all the way through or not quitting until you've achieved your desired goal  
that is a biblical principle  
 "" know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ? 
so run , that ye may obtain  "" 
1 corinthians 9 : 24 [kjv] 
achieving anything worthy in life requires "" playing it to the bone ""  
we need to develop fully persuaded mindsets and commitment levels in order to endure and persevere past the obstacles and distractions which lay between us and our stated objectives  
this is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in the developing maturity of our spiritual lives "

no , this isn't the lineup for monday night football  
rather , these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in "" the 13th warrior , "" a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory  
based on michael crichton's book , eaters of the dead , this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought  
their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword  
luckily for the vikings , however , their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film  
antonio bandaras is ahmed , a travelling ambassador  
accompanied by his friend ( omar shariff in a cameo ) , they eventually come across a small viking village  
we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude  
they laugh heartily , revel in their arrogance , and sing songs of battles won  
but their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land  
help is needed quickly  
an elderly , fortune-telling witch arrives  
after a brief incantation , she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more "" not of norse blood "" are needed to ensure victory  
personally , i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity  
nonetheless , 12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th  
the group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives  
of course during their ride , ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other 12 burly viking warriors  
but he ably shows that it's not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog  
he is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings , but will his skills ( and that of the group ) be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside ? 
it does not look promising  
these creatures , resembling bears , are strong and have high morale  
they are fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies  
they attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon  
the warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods  
they are ready to sacrifice their lives  
 "" this is a good way to die , "" says one of the fallen warriors  
despite the larger-than-life battle sequences , i was unmoved by the entire experience  
at many points , i was even confused  
for example , somewhere in the middle of the film , a sub-plot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land  
he seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis  
however , the sub-plot never fully materializes , and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion  
there are other questions that i had , but the real problem was that the story ( little of it that there was ) offered no characters to love or hate  
the leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma  
however , banderas's role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special  
an entire rewrite of the ahmed character is in order  
also , much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night , which made battles very difficult to follow  
i would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy  
as it stands , the film manages more confusion than intensity  
it would make thor cry "
-1," "" my name is jack carter , and you don't want to know me "" says our brooding anti-hero ( sylvester stallone )  
take his advice ! 
to know this guy is as rewarding as being thrown over a terrace  
and to watch this film is almost as painful  
 "" get carter "" is a gloomy looking , unimaginative film that offers no joy  
jack carter is as tough as tough guys come  
he works out of vegas as a self-described 'financial adjuster'  
explaining his duties , he says , "" people make promises and break them  
i help them remember  "" 
he has a chiseled body full of tattoos  
he has the weathered look indicative of a man who has seen his share of hard times  
he speaks in a hushed but menacing tone of voice  
in other words , this is sylvester stallone acting like    sylvester 
stallone  
and like most of his previous roles , his character is a shallow , one-dimensional thug whose modus operandi is to talk tough , hassle a few hapless people , find out what he needs to know , and then dispense his own kind of justice  
with the charisma of a pit bull , being tough is all that jack carter knows  
yet , even tough guys know when to put family first  
as the story begins , we learn that jack's little brother has died in a car accident  
the police attribute it to heavy drinking  
however , jack is suspicious , believing that he was 'taken out'  
he takes a break from his vegas duties and tries to see if he can find the truth  
as he pokes around , he runs into several lowlife characters  
they include a shady business partner , a prostitute , a dweebish millionaire molded after bill gates , and an oily owner of a porn website  
any one of them may know something about his brother's death  
all of them have the means of carrying out the deed  
but don't expect an exercise in sleuthing where well-placed clues lead carter to the truth  
he's all brawn and no brains , so there are no epiphanies during his investigation  
instead , he uses intimidation to muscle his way forward , cycling through this circle of suspects  
flustered with his lack of progress , he cycles through them again and again  
this all gets tiring fairly quickly  
by the time the film launches into its final act , we're numb from its pedestrian pace  
oddly , as a tough-guy thriller , it starves us for action  
admittedly , there is one nifty chase sequence , but this is related to a tangential and needless plot ( carter's vegas ties send thugs to retrieve him )  
the story also fails to generate any kind of emotion  
stallone has the personality of a slab of stone  
and the look and feel of the film is perpetually downcast  
the weather is constantly overcast or rainy  
meanwhile , most shots take place at night , in dimly lit rooms , or in dark alleys "

-1,"i suppose it's unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk , which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it's 1991 release  
michael lehmann's action-comedy was quick to win the title `biggest box office flop of all time' , or close thereof  
the movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk , who's just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation ( `let me put it this way , ' he explains , `i never saw et' )  
greeting him is his old friend and partner in crime ( played by danny aiello ) , who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes  
these are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags , cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences  
it appears as if director lehmann didn't know when to stop all the absurd silliness , and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line  
if at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn't get goofier , you'll soon be eating your words  
but , i'm inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it's box office numbers suggest  
it's fast-paced and entertaining , if you've got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor  
for the first portion of this review , i'm going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk  
wish me luck  
first and foremost : bruce willis is a good sport  
while i'm not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co-wrote this script , willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big , fat , ugly joke  
he constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out-of-place , which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions  
another plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character  
they meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican , and their relationship escalates in interest from there  
it's unfortunate that mcdowell's one-note character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot-twist , and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis  
but now i'm rambling on again about the negative things , aren't i ? 
enough of the charade - for the most part , hudson hawk is an excruciating experience  
it's stupid , pointless and repetitive  
i can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater , because this film really doesn't have the potential to please anyone  
action fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90% comedy , and even the action sequences are skittery , rushed and poorly edited  
and those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache-inducing hi-jinks  
don't get me wrong , this film is not devoid of laughs  
it's too bad most of them are unintentional , or just plain forced  
the impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed  
it's understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber , but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn i'm not entirely sure  
coburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play , and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie  
especially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown , and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film  
things get more bizarre when we're introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars , including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless , card-flipping kit-kat  
if that's not enough for you , there's richard e  grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover  
their crotch-biting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here  
wait , maybe the only big laughs    
i'm not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk  
i can't even begin to start about the film's absurd plot ; but let's not get into that  
i suppose there's some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise , if they were that desperate  
but hudson hawk never even has a clue of where it's going from minute one , and from there it's 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck "

mission to mars 
a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman 
there's a world of difference between artists and technicians  
the artist has a vision to create something new  
he may not do it well , it might be sloppy , but it's something you've never seen before  
a good technician can make it look good , but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else , it's going to be just a xerox  
obviously successful films need both skills  
brian de palma is a masterful technician  
he's spent his career copying others , most notably hitchcock  
he usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work , but only because he has learned it by rote  
aside from rare flashes of originality , his films are often soul-dead  
in de palma's latest , he turns his attention to stanley kubrick  
to tell the truth , i enjoyed portions of this movie , but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called "" 2001 ""  
i enjoyed it even more when it was titled "" close encounters ""  
nasa has set its sights for mars  
when the first crew meets with disaster , a rescue mission is sent to the red planet  
they don't do so well either , but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut-gone-rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe  
and it's all so boring  
there are so many scenes that just don't work , it's difficult to begin  
when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside-down martian tornado ( which looks remarkably like a sandworm from "" dune "" ) destroying everything in its path , they just hang out watching  
error  
the most interesting character ( and that's not saying much ) is killed off  
error  
the alien is laughable  
error  
the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable  
error  
there's some nice eyecandy  
the face on mars , which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head , looks cool  
a three-dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world  
maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic  
but there's so much more that feels as if we've been there before  
from "" 2001 "" , there's the rotating space station , the blinding white room  
>from "" close encounters "" , they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens  
the list goes on  
the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues

be forewarned  
 "" quick , robin ! 
the anti-shark repellant ! "" 
- adam west in the 1966 batman feature film , casually kicking at a pathetic-looking rubber shark attached to his leg 
i had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness , but in many instances batman and robin nears , and at some point even exceeds this standard  
this is a disasterously bad film , easily the worst in the series to date , and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive - it's loud , garish , and obnoxious , with pointless , gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill  
batman and robin features the caped crusaders ( george clooney debuting as batman , with chris o'donnell returing as robin ) squaring off against another bevy of chemically-induced villains - the nefarious ice-cold mr  freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) , armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights , and the slinky poison ivy ( uma thurman ) , who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her ( not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result , but whatever ) , and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss  
by ivy's side is the giant steroid monster bane ( jeep swanson ) , a grunting hulk of a beast  
the villains' goals are noble ones - freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit ( in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees ) , so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife ( vendela ) , dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation , and ivy's intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth , albeit by destroying all human life  
meanwhile , on the homefront , life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth ( michael gough ) , and the arrival of his niece barbara ( alicia silverstone )  
akiva goldsman's screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad , with astonishingly terrible dialogue , lame jokes , and an awful by-the-number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement  
it makes goldsman's screenplay of batman forever , which i thought was dreadful , look positively inspired in comparison  
i am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i'd seen used in - no joke - an episode of gilligan's island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production  
joel schumacher's direction of batman and robin is horrific , with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance  
there is a clear conceit towards neon in this film , even moreso than with his previous batman forever , with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo ( just in case , i suppose , if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin ) , and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly-pointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivy's chosen new abode  
another action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late-night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons  
mr  schumacher's focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible , to the detriment of the story - there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all-out camp and heartfelt drama , with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective  
it is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film's opening , even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered  
is batman and robin supposed to be campy ? 
i think it is - it's hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously  
 ( one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted "" bomb ! "" 
each time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory  ) 
is it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be ? 
i somehow doubt it - the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn't attempting to be the utter farce which it is  
arnold schwarzenegger is top-billed in the film as the villainous mr  freeze , and is bland and uninteresting , perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be  
mr  schwarzenegger's attempts to be menacing are laughable , and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable ; frankly , everything he does onscreen is laughable  
by the end of the film , i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen  
the bulk of his performance consists of uttering near-unintelligble puns and one-liners featuring every possible permutation of "" cool ! "" 
in the least inventive way  
george clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin , being overshadowed by the villains , and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film  
his batman is hardly an imposing figure  
chris o'donnell is unimpressive in a one-note performance , while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all  
the film's one saving grace ? 
undoubtably uma thurman's entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy  
her work in batman and robin is certainly over-the-top , but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film  
ms  thurman's comic timing is impeccable , and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully  
 ( i'm already starting to positively reassess jim carrey's performance in batman forever  ) 
her amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film , and when she's offscreen the film greatly suffers  
i figure that if one has to die , being kissed to death by uma thurman isn't a half-bad way to go  
while batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulse-pounding excitement , i must admit that i was not bored watching it , although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening - my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or one-liner , and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat  
it's been a long time since i've laughed so much at a movie "
-1,"when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects  
while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don't think that they are completely to blame for this movie's failure  
it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the "" unseen "" terrors , and it was about as scary as a dust bunny  
so special effects or not , if the story isn't the least bit scary , you aren't going to end up with a very frightening movie  
the thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern  
dern is always great , and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie  
as i sat through the seemingly endless , albeit fairly impressive , special effects , i kept wishing that this movie was about dern's caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast  
never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie  
liam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear  
he decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion  
he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia  
and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings-on  
catherine zeta-jones , lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects  
like the original , taylor's character is the star of the movie  
but since she doesn't quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms  zeta-jones , their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original  
and let's face it , probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta-jones  
i'll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren't in it  
but the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets  
they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients  
there really isn't much of a story here  
just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with  
and the special effects are great  
in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere  
in other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the "" cool shots "" quota  
at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary -- funny , maybe  
but not scary  
then we have the set  
when i first saw the house , i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it  
but it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did , and decided to take the idiotically overdone route  
this included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves  
what part did these rooms play in the story ? 
absolutely none  
they were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie  
then we have the actors  
lili taylor has never been one of my favorites  
and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in , she comes in around the average or slightly below mark  
i have no idea why liam neeson took this role  
he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus  
his character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him "
-1,"capsule : annoyingly unentertaining , obvious and paper-thin buddy/cop/drug/sexy-witness movie  
presence of director michael bay shows none of the talent he demonstrated in the rock  
i've seen this movie already , i said , as i looked at the box art  
no , i haven't even seen a trailer for the movie ; i don't even know what it's about , but i can look at the way they're promoting it , and i know i've seen it already  
i thought : it's about these two cops  
and they're buddies , sort of  
they're at each other's throats a lot , but they really do like each other  
and everyone else in their department hates them 'cause they're hot-shots  
and they have some kind of diametric opposition in their relationship  
and one day they're in the middle of cop business as usual when they get mixed up in this plot that involves a really sadistic bad guy with lots of henchmen who can never hit anything with the billions of rounds of ammo they are always carrying  
and the bad guy is a drug lord  
and there's a witness , and she's this sexy thing who rubs both of them the wrong way  
and their supervisor wants their badges for breakfast when they blow up half the town bringing this guy down  
i only missed the bit about the badges  
the rest i got dead-on  
and i hadn't even left the video store yet  
the cops in this movie are will smith and martin lawrence , and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo  
smith plays a cop who has a trust fund and is thus not a cop for the money ; martin l  is a family man ( shades of the now-tired lethal weapon dynamic here ) whose wife and he are at total odds  
this leads to some strained scenes about lawrence's "" not getting any "" , and some totally unneccesary bits with him skulking around his own house , thinking his partner is now his wife's "" back door man ""  
not funny ; tiresome  
bad boys gets some of its incredibly meager selling points from the presence of will smith and martin lawrence  
will smith is a natural , and i'm happy to see him in movies like six degrees    
and men in black  
he's funny and charming without trying to be ; he really does seem to be enjoying himself  
martin lawrence is a different story ; he's so uptight and verbally constipated that sitting through his improvised riffs are a trial  
movies like this are not about originality  
i know this  
they are about style and energy and synergy between actors  
i know this , too  
and yet , while watching bad boys , which its glamorous photography and impossibly exact stunt choreography , i felt fed up  
i'd seen con air , which despite being completely implausible , was still great fun , because it tried however feebly to put some new life into the mix  
bad boys is a dry run -- and overlong , too , clocking in at just over two hours with a lot more by-play than i felt could be justified  
i could write this movie  
you could write this movie  
many people have  
many people will continue to write this movie , over and over again "

-1,"i'll be the first to admit it  
when you mention the book great expectations , i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class , where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch  
yes , it's a classic of literature , but it was a rather dry one , shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine  
certainly , the experience wasn't truly that bad , but , to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book , "" i'm not going to tell the story the way it happened    i'll 
gonna tell it the way i remember it  "" 
anyway , to return from nostalgia lane , and get back to the present , hollywood , in it's trendy attempt to modernize the classics , now presents an updated film version of great expectations  
instead of pip , this time the central character is named finn ( played as a boy by jeremy kissner , and by ethan hawke as an adult )  
finn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie , or should that be mrs  joe , ( kim dickens ) , and her boorish fisherman husband , joe ( chris cooper )  
the setting is the florida coast during the mid-70s  
finn is a blooming artist , and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish ( one of his two favorite subjects )  
during one of these escapades , he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal ( robert deniro )  
borrowing a page from the superhuman max cady , deniro's criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity , and favors hiding on the ocean floor  
ok    maybe 
that's an exaggeration , but he certainly beats any of houdini's records in the opening scenes of the film  
and that's nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finn's motorboat , but i digress  
anyway , finn does the convict a good deed , just to show that he's a really swell guy  
and then the plot moves on  
enter miss havisham    or 
ms  dinsmoor here ( anne bancroft )  
abandoned at the altar some 26 years ago , ms  dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid  
with bizarre clothing , eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup , anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role  
although she ends up nowhere near a believable character , she does add some humor to the film  
joe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner , but the insane ms  dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece , estella ( raquel beaudene as a young girl , gwyneth paltrow as an adult )  
for no apparent reason , other than to provide the main plot of the film , finn is instantly stricken for the estella  
perhaps it's her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person , or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before  
in any case , neither as children nor adults , chemistry simply doesn't exist between the two , and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her  
even when , as an adult , finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor , reacquaints himself with estella , and draws her portrait in the nude , there's nothing  
in fact , there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnear's gay artist during a similar scene in as good as it gets  
at this point , the audience has grown as cold and detached as estella's character , and couldn't care less about the two characters "

-1,"a few months before the release of star wars episode 1 , the phantom menace , 20th century fox decides to release another space film , that is a complete rip off of star wars  
what is the point of this ? 
i do not know , but i wish it hadn't been done , considering wing commander is definitely the year's worst film so far  
to attract people to this horrible movie , they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace  
wing commander will draw large crowds , because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time  
the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight  
many people do not know that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game  
i found this very interesting , considering this fact almost says that wing commander is a star wars movie  
it is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though  
freddie prinze jr  stars in the film as christopher blair  
wing commander was a huge mistake for freddie  
this was definitely his worst performance to date  
after january's she's all that , i actually saw a good actor in freddie , but now all those visions have been crushed  
 ( for now anyway  ) 
christopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi , a group that is trying to destroy the earth  
blair's parents also fought in the space battles , and also died there  
his parents were pilgrims , so many people disrespect him because of this  
blair is under the command of "" angel "" , played by saffron burrows , and he is friends with another pilot , todd "" maniac marshall "" , played by matthew lillard  
matthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie , and he does in this one too  
his character as stu in 1996's scream ( a+ ) , was a great one , but now , it seems like that same role is being played again , only in a space movie  
the three are just a small part of a large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth  
this plot is very flimsy , and doesn't give a whole lot to work with at all  
this explains why wing commander drags on , seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on  
the acting is horrible in wing commander  
many lines seem out of place , and are completely meaningless  
the acting and dialogue was so terrible , i even found myself laughing at it  
the other things which are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music  
the special effects are very unrealistic  
when looking at two ships flying side by side , it is simple to tell they are hanging and a blue screen is behind them  
the explosions look very unrealistic as well  
a ship will be blown up , but there will only be fire present four about one half of a second  
this is very unrealistic  
music pretty much accompanies the film the entire time  
the music also felt like video game music , and it was very corny and annoying sounding  
after we are given the plot , the film repeats itself for another hour , without any plot twists , interesting scenes , or anything important to the film  
blair is forced to make jumps over other planets , and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft  
for the entire length of the movie , it takes place in space  
it is truly like you are in a video game , because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for a long , extended period of time  
it's not much fun to watch at all "

like the three musketeers , they've been together through thick and thin  
but , when darren meets an attractive , but cold-blooded and manipulative , psychiatrist , judith ( amanda peet ) , the long time friendship is placed in danger  
it's up to wayne and j  d  to rescue their best friend in "" saving silverman  "" 
 "" silverman "" has its heart in the right place , but the story , by newcomers hank nelken and greg depaul , is too lightweight to sustain the tale of the battle for darren's soul  
based on their experience of a friend making a major marital mistake , the story is centered on the three , life long amigos  
when wayne introduces darren to judith , he doesn't realize that he has opened a pandora's box of disaster for himself and j  d  judith was once in a relationship where her boyfriend was the dominant figure until he died in a kick boxing match  
since then , she has sought a new mate - someone she can boss around and mold into her own vision  
enter darren silverman  
once they realize the magnitude of their error in judgement , wayne and j  d  try everything they can , including threats and bribery , to get judith to free darren  
nothing works until the duo come up with a plan - kidnap judith and get darren back together with the girl he called his one and only , pretty sandy perkus ( amanda detmer )  
the only problem here is that sandy is about to take her vows to become a nun  
things spiral out of control as judith repeatedly attempts to escape while wayne and j  d  play cupid  
the boys even bring their idol , neil diamond , into the picture to help resolve things  
thinking about it , this is a real mishmash of contrivance and coincidence that is held together solely by the comedic efforts of steve zahn and jack black  
the pair is able to elicit the film's only laughs with their goofy antics and child-like behavior  
they are relegated to providing slapstick guy humor and the two are more than equal to the task  
steve zahn has been steadily honing his comedic acting skills and gives some complexity to wayne , the "" brains "" of the gang  
jack black has the big-guy moves of a chris farley , giving j  d  an amusing physical presence  
the neat thing is that the two actors are able to get fresh laughs from stale material  
the rest of the cast doesn't fare as well , though  
jason biggs is the straight man of the musketeers and gets very little to do ; though having watched his previous films ( "" american pie "" and "" loser "" ) i'm not sure what attraction biggs actually has  
amanda peet is caustic as the manipulative judith  
there is no humanity at all to her character as she single-mindedly strives to recreate darren into her mind's image  
she's a monster that wayne and j  d  must defeat to save their friend "
-1,"the following review encompasses two versions of dune : 
dune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book  
the film's visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative  
dune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television  
it was disowned by director david lynch but it's considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline  
quality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web  
 * * * the review * * * 
released in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert's cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans  
director david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico  
the screenplay was lynch's own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected  
dune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors  
the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that's home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange  
the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe  
it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it  
most importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to "" fold space "" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish  
lynch's film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story's two main strands  
one is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis  
the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen  
the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom  
unfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended  
the thinking among universal's oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office  
with lynch's initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made  
what a great idea ! 
why not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ? 
the most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters  
thus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul's father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless  
the end result is a distinct chill : we can't warm to most of the cast and we don't care much for them  
and it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book  
dune is also a very serous film  
the constant "" self-talk "" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment  
the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them  
humour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen's mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find  
you may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus' star wars trilogy  
the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however  
it still possesses enough of lynch's stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi  
special effects whiz carlo rambaldi's giant sandworms are an awesome sight  
both the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original  
and the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years  
with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses  
see it in the widescreen format if you can  
and despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen  
sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who's secret aim is to manipulate paul's destiny for its own shadowy ends  
as paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade "
-1,"capsule : an insult  
a stupid and incompetent movie that doesn't even have the benefit of being trashily enjoyable  
weslely and woody would do well to leave this off their resumes  
money train is one of the worst movies i have ever seen  
it's not simply idiotic , it's contemptuous of its audience  
it tries to make us swallow things that a better movie would be stopped cold by or just plain omit entirely  
it's a waste of wesley snipes and woody harrelson , who are enjoyable actors in their own rights but are nauseating here  
it's not even fun as trash  
woody and wesley star ( maybe that's not the right word ) as new york city transit authority police  
they have a job which could actually be the core of a really interesting movie : one of them plays drunk possum to attract chain-snatchers and the other does lookout  
i had a whole headful of legal and ethical questions surrounding this , raised by a documentary i'd seen on the subject once , but the movie does not waste any time with being intelligent or thought-provoking  
see if you can follow this  
they chase a kid down the tunnel and into the station where the "" money train "" , the heavily armored car that picks up all the cash from the token books , is parked  
the guards on the train see this kid running at them , lift their machine guns , shout "" halt ! "" 
and then open fire when the kid doesn't stop running at them  
blam , the kid's dead  
then woody and wesley show up , and of course the other ta cops hate them ( why ? ) , and a pushing match starts , and someone gets decked , and    i covered my face  
i'd seen enough  
i've never seen a movie work so hard and in so little time to destroy , systematically , any chance of being credible or interesting  
fed up with the bs at their job ( most of it their own goddamned fault ) , woody and wesley hatch this plot about how to rob the money train  
hence the title , in case some of you ( all two of you ) didn't figure it out yet  
then there's this subplot about a maniac who torches token book clerks , * and * a love story , * and * a holdup -- no , two holdups , sorry , easy to lose track in a movie this braindead -- * and * a mob boss who wants his money  
there wasn't a minute when i gave a horse's ass about any of it  
neither woody nor wesley play characters that are interesting for a single minute  
we do not care about them  
they are not interesting  
they are noisy , loud , stupid , foolish jerks who whould have flunked out of the police academy  
they deserve to get shot -- or run over , as the case may be  
they only exist to rehash the kind of dynamics that was * written * into a movie like white men can't jump , and which simply does not exist here  
they are idiots , and we're expected to root for them  
bullcrap  
the movie is completely schizophrenic in its tone and texture  
what exactly is this mess ? 
a cop movie ? 
police procedure is not given a moment's genuine thought anywhere  
a thriller ? 
the subplot with the token booth killer is inept , a throwaway that should have been ditched in the rewrite  
a comedy ? 
the few jokes that do work are wasted  
a drama ? 
all dramatic tension between both principals is freeze-dried and off-the-rack  
there's not a moment in the movie where i felt like i was listening to genuine human beings talk ; it's all screenwriterese , that bizarre analect where every sentence ends in a punchline and the primary mode of expression is the unique conjunctions of four-letter words "

it's cheesy all right , but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch  
that's a shame , because , in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more  
woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise , roy munson  
the movie opens in the fifties with roy's dad dishing out the reader's digest/gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls , shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever  
the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray , as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken  
it's thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good - he gives the wry , derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy  
mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job , then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy's hand  
then it's fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat , balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand  
he's hopeless until he meets ishmael ( randy quaid ) , an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege  
so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno , picking up pretty hustler claudia ( vanessa angel ) on the way  
with the exit of bill murray , the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go , and that's    
dumb and dumber  
yes , indeed , kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour , peter and bobby farrelly , the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle  
so , prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands , distended nipples , ridiculous hair and bull semen  
get set for stock fish-out-of-water situations when city-boy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community , or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking , striptease and unchristian neighbour-socking  
now , don't get me wrong , there's nothing wrong with cheap humour , and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy  
the trouble is that these jokes aren't bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction  
it lurches from sports movie to amish-mocking to road-trip to sentimental melodrama , ( pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal , and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack ) , never quite getting it all together  
some gags fall flat from a lack of build-up , while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply don't do anything  
why the long , unfunny fight in the car park ? 
why two of these ? 
why does that guy wear mascara , or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it ? 
the film is full of these half-thought-through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer , grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying , "" wouldn't that be funny ? ""  
well , no , actually  
the actors don't do the movie much favours either  
woody harrelson comes off okay , plausibly acting dumb , smart , cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it , but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham , and vanessa angel has no talent ( like schwarzenegger , she seems more convincing playing a computer-creation than a human -- take the tv series weird science    please 
 )  
even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movie's climax  
all in all , a fairly useless attempt at comedy , and a certified no-hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance  
we'll have to look to a reinspired john waters , or perhaps somebody from down under ( "" strictly bowling "" , anyone ? ) for the definitive bowling comedy  
the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video  
 * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 
 * * * pretty good , bring a friend  
 * * * * amazing , potent stuff "

-1,"actually , i'm fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie  
 "" baywatch "" babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her double-d's on the small screen  
at least there you don't have to pay to see her cleavage  
and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless , hate to burst your bubble , but there are no full-fledged nude scenes in barb wire  
you wouldn't be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in  
i can't go back in time and reverse my mistake , but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there  
they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude , it's so quick you can't even tell for sure whether you're seeing her andersons or not  
a nipple hallucination sort of thing  
barb wire was adapted from a comic book , interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life , even wearing low-cut leather to do office work ( businesswoman bondage wear ) and having unreal body proportions  
yes , like the mona lisa , pamela anderson is a man-made beauty , probably in more senses than one  
she is a definite beauty , though , and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience  
you'd just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn't have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie , because it's obvious she wasn't pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills  
i mean , she shows off more cleavage here than a jeweler's convention  
the movie is set in the year 2017 , "" the worst year of my life , "" pam says  
 ( "" the worst movie of the year , "" i say  ) 
america is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation ( silicone valley , i think )  
she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right , posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute  
but don't call her "" babe  "" 
she hates that , and reminds us of that fact way too many times  
imagine , a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred to in such a sexist , demeaning term  
a liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldn't have to hear words like "" babe "" during a strip tease , especially since that movie about the talking pig was such a success  
the plot ( ha-ha ) revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorate's retina scanners  
in the words of one of the characters , they're "" more than meets the eye  "" 
reminds me of the "" transformers "" cartoon , and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent , but that never happened  
no , the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela van-damme , big-busted kickboxer , and her resistance accomplices , ex-boyfriend axel ( tamuera morrison ) and cora ( victoria rowell )  
thank god they didn't name her cora reef  
one bad character name is more than enough  
pamela originally doesn't take sides , giving some speech about she's only loyal to the money they pay her , but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother , jack noseworthy of bon jovi "" always "" video fame  
i still don't know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy , but he definitely is nose worthy ( even if he isn't sponge worthy )  
pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi-automatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest  
it's not rambo    
it's bimbo ! 
mark my words , barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in a year  
it's got all the elements of the direct-to-video releases featured on hbo's bastard cousin , the cable channel i'd never watch if it didn't somehow come free  
it's got the non-titillating scenes of voyeurism , laughable flashbacks , bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo  
there's even a narrator at the beginning setting up the movie's premise while the words scroll up the screen  
someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this ain't star wars  
if you've seen any action flick of the past fifteen years , you'll recognize plenty of lifted elements "

mean , an evil man  
he vows revenge on that man and is taught the ways of the musketeer by some old dude who used to be one himself ? 
anyway , fourteen years go by and    arrgh , well , you know the rest    swish-swish-zzzzzzz ! 
critique : this is a pretty bad movie  
let's see , where should i start ? 
okay , first of all , the story is just plain boring  
it's not original , is entirely predictable and lacks energy  
okay , what's next ? 
acting , you say  
hmmmm , well , the main actor , justin chambers , is basically an uncharismatic version of chris o'donnell but with less range ( think about that ! ) , and mena suvari , is just plain off  
not as bad as thora birch was in dungeons & dragons , but entirely miscast , with bad deliveries , awful sequences and a piss-poor accent that comes and goes  
now i'm not sure if this was ms  suvari's fault or the director's , but i've definitely seen her at a much higher level than in this film  
the only semi-saving grace actor-wise is tim roth as the irrepressible "" bad guy "" , but once again , it's not something that we haven't seen before    a 
thousand times    by the same guy ! ! 
tim , please    for the love of god , beg your agent to ask the marketplace for some modern day "" american roles "" for you as a "" nice guy "" in a romantic comedy or something

we all know that you can do much better than this gunk  
alright , what else was bad in this film ? 
oh yeah , the score ! 
yikes , how's about taking it down a few notches there , fellas ? 
this thing blares in your ear whenever it feels the need to accentuate a certain scene , but actually does little more than annoy  
i think it's important for the man behind the music to recognize that this film isn't a "" real epic "" by any stretch of the imagination  
it's a fluffy rehashed cake-walk created by some "" shrewd "" studio heads who decided to take advantage of the whole "" kung-fu "" phenomenon in films , and test it out on an old classic

-1,"underwater science fiction stays submerged 
sphere a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman 
one of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents  
you keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered  
psychologist norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of a plane crash  
when he arrives at the site , he discovers that there is no plane , but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting 1 , 000 feet below the surface for almost 300 years  
having written a paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact , he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship  
his group as outlined in his report , consists of beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist ; harry adams ( samuel l  jackson ) , a mathematician ; and ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist  
unfortunately it turns out that the writing was a blow-off project for goodman who did it for the money and named his then-colleagues to the team  
 "" after all , "" he explains , "" who reads government documents ? "" 
lead by harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , a top secret federal operative , the group descends to a mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel  
once there they stroll over , knock on the door and explore the still-operational ufo  
discovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere  
when adams enters the sphere , the weirdness unfolds  
a storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer  
 "" my name is jerry  
i am happy "" flashes across the screen  
this is unsettling for the psychologist  
 "" what happens if jerry gets mad ? "" he asks  
barnes is more pragmatic : he needs a last name because he can't put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry  
then the situation turns bad  
deadly beasts appear from nowhere  
a gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel  
lethal sea snakes attack goodman  
a giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading "" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea ""  
the suspicious scientists turn against each other  
this has all the makings of a first-rate thinking man's science fiction film  
however even the finest ingredients don't go very far in the hands of a chief who doesn't seem to care about his product  
director barry levinson has churned out a mish-mosh that doesn't engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes  
the first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification  
it's much like speed-reading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances  
it doesn't get any better when the action scenes begin  
while the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles , the people are still flat  
oddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them  
after adams experiences the interior of the sphere , no one bothers to ask him what happened  
their history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited  
even goodman and halperin's ill-conceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing  
her psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing  
there's a truism that items shown early in a movie must be used before the ending , but here they are far too obvious  
when an emergency mini-sub is explained , you know what's going to happen  
the movie affectations are nothing more than distracting "

-1,"synopsis : sullen julie james , still haunted by nightmares of the killer ben willis from i know what you did last summer , perks up when her new best friend karla wilson wins a trip for four to the bahamas  
arriving at the start of the hurricane season , julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize they've walked into a trap set by the rainslickered slasher with a huge hook for a hand  
comments : i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here , but i have never seen an episode of the fox tv series "" party of five  "" 
i am only vaguely aware of the show's premise , and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i half-paid attention to while watching the tube  
 "" party of five , "" i do know however , seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre  
neve campbell , scream queen of the 90s and star of scream , scream 2 , and the craft , is a regular of the show  
so too is jennifer love hewitt  
lo and behold , following in the footsteps of campbell , hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own : the i know what you did last summer line  
though the original film , released last year , was watchable enough , this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater's glowing red exit sign longingly throughout  
jennifer love hewitt is a very good-looking young leading lady ; however , unlike neve campbell , hewitt struggles with acting  
she just isn't convincing in this film ( and she wasn't in the original either )  
this puts many young males , including myself , in a paradoxical quandary : she's very attractive , but the annoying , spoiled , valley girl-type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize , exploitatively , her figure  
add to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy , another rising teen tv star , and you get one frustrated male audience  
i've spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for a reason  
i still know what you did last summer , though cashing in on the success of the original , ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses  
nothing else here is original or interesting  
this movie , in fact , makes other recent so-so horror films like urban legend and john carpenter's vampires seem like stunning works of high art  
i still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches : an isolated location , a storm , parentless teenagers , false alarm nightmares , lots of blue-lighted darkness scenes , a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him , knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere , etc  you get the picture  
the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killer's hook  
they may as well have huge targets painted on them  
like scream and its numerous knockoffs , these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief  
unfortunately , i still know's characters aren't all that funny  
in particular , one character , a chain-weed-smoking guy , is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesn't die soon enough  
the death scenes , by the way , are relatively violent for a theatrically released horror film  
several of them are uncomfortable to watch , and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser : bloodline , a truly sadistic movie  
this , too , did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for  
and what is the deal with the slasher himself ? 
i know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre , but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror  
come on , the guy looks like the gorton's fisherman , and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate  
though his lightning-lit appearances ellicited much-needed laughter in the theater , his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film , and that's * really * saying something  
so , all that's left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy  
both prance about in tightfitting , revealing outfits or in various states of undress , yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene  
hewitt , however , does do a post-shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite  
  
  titillating  
this scene alone made this one-star turkey earn two stars under my rating system  
otherwise , hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves  
early in the film , for instance , brandy wins the trip to the bahamas "
-1,
-1,"like a good action film should , "" metro "" has action that keeps you involved  
some action films have action sequences that are so conventional , our attention is detracted and diverted by other thoughts  
 "" the ghost in the darkness , "" which opened a few months ago , is a film that s action was so bland and uninvolving , it not only invited my thoughts to divert me , it nearly put me asleep  
but "" metro "" is one of the best action films in a while  
it is hip , sharp , nifty , and has nice little pieces of suspense and comedy  
eddie murphy was in bad shape for a while  
and this invites me to mention last year s "" the nutty professor , "" which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be  
 "" metro "" happens to be a lot better than any film in the "" beverly hills cop "" series  
that is because "" metro "" takes itself seriously , but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun  
eddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible , and controlled people  
the "" beverly hills cop "" movies all featured eddie as a reckless , wild cop , always crossing the line by just an inch  
in "" metro "" he plays a hostage negotiator , so negotiation is his job , not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble  
his character in "" metro "" takes himself seriously  
eddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in "" metro , "" and perhaps it is quite better off that way  
murphy plays scott roper , and as i previously mentioned , he is a san francisco hostage negotiator  
in the first tense situation in the film , we are introduced to roper s kind of work , as he tries to calm down a confused , unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up  
murphy handles the scene seriously , without his usual happy-go-lucky , misfit humor  
the film develops when its villain is established , and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda , a jewel thief , and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim  
 "" metro "" takes different twists and slight turns , and there is one great , virtuoso chase scene , involving the a cable car  
cars flip  
cars crash  
cars turn over  
and it is done so good in this film , i was reminded of "" speed , "" and the speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons  
there are also some other good scenes in "" metro "" that a lot of films would rather choose not to have  
scenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning  
of course , the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling  
the scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice , too  
those are the scenes that make up "" metro , "" which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality  
the actor that i most enjoyed seeing in "" metro "" was michael rapaport , who plays roper s new partner , a lip-reading , book-skimming genius , and a master of observation  
it was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius  
rapaport is an actor who i usually see in the role of the dimwit the really , really dopey dimwit  
i hardly recognized him in "" metro , "" and it was quite a joy to be able to see him in a role like this i feel that i respect him more  
there are two main types of villains in movies like this : the ones that are part of the story , and the ones that are devices  
the villain in "" metro "" is no more than a device , but he is a darn good villain nonetheless  
he is played by michael wincott , whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp , as if he smokes a cigarette between every take  
wincott makes his villain , korda , as mean as could be , the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks , like richard widmark in "" kiss of death  "" 
and , in addition , wincott s physical appearance and mannerisms , in the film , actually reminded my of an arrogant friend i use to have , who is no longer on my good list  
i liked "" metro , "" and i do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy  
his past roles were the great ones but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later take place , possibly from murphy s growing as a person , now having a family "

starring lee kang-sheng , yang kuei-mei directed by tsai ming-liang written by tsai and yang ping-ying cinematography by liao peng-jung 
taiwan , 24/12/99  
the millenium approaches  
an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city  
sectors of the city are being sealed , quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus  
the virus causes people to act like insects : they crawl about on all fours , hide from bright lights , huddle in damp corners  
the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a week's time  
residents are advised to evacuate the area , asap  
this premise--kafka by way of cronenberg--is the background for the hole , which could have been a great movie , but , sadly , ends up as a waste of good ideas  
the quick sketch above suggests a dark , absurd , hallucinatory near-future parable of life in the late 20th century ; in execution , however , it is nothing like that  
the virus , the evacuation , the visual possiblities of the deluge : these are all relegated to the background  
instead , the hole focuses on the lives--for want of a better word--of a man ( lee kang-sheng ) and a woman ( yang kuei-mei ) who live in the same apartment building , and who have no personalities  
the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile : the charmless rooms and corridors of a post-industrial apartment complex , photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible  
it's a vivid setting , but an unappealing one , especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background  
the man lives in the apartment directly above the woman's  
one day , a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of the man's living room , opening into the ceiling of the woman's living room  
this hole--symbol of the solitary opening in the character's lonely , compartmented lives--allows them to interact in unusual ( and mostly non-verbal ) ways  
example : the man , suffering from the onset of the virus ( or so i assume--everything is obscure in this movie ) vomits through the hole  
the woman , wandering around in the dark , accidentally puts her hand on his vomit , and then cleans it up  
this is what passes for meaningful communication  
and they say romance is dead  
much of the film does not even focus on their interactions , such as they are  
there is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people  
they are ciphers  
instead , we are treated to long takes in which we witness their miserable lives ; we watch , for instance , as the woman boils some water , pours it onto some noodles , then eats the noodles  
 ( this is as fascinating as it sounds  ) 
offered as counterpoint--or perhaps relief--to these dreary sequences are a series of musical numbers , fantasies in which the woman lip-synchs to pop songs by grace chan ( popular , so i'm told , in 1950s' china )  
she prances around in grimy hallways and grungy stairwells , incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights  
sometimes , in these fantasies , she is joined by the man  
these scenes are presumably intended to be bright and fanciful , sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality , but they fail  
when the man and the woman dance , it seems half-hearted and listless  
astaire and rogers this is not  
even in imagination , these people are numb , weary , boring  
the hole is part of the 'collection 2000' series , a group of films commissioned by french tv station la sept arte on the subject of the millenium  
others include canada's last night , brazil's midnight , and american hal hartley's the book of life  
the book of life is the only other one that i have seen , and it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry  
witty , energetic , humane , it makes the the hole seem ( ahem ) empty  
american movies with nothing to say try to disguise their lack of content with flashy movements , quick cuts , superficial emotions  
foreign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does : they point the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time , and call it art "

-1,"vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico  
the house has a nest of vampires and jack crow ( james woods ) is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out  
while the initial imagery is a little over-dramatic , it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence  
that is enough action to last us a while and we could , director john carpenter would let us , get to a story line  
but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene  
then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that  
the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end  
and that is something of a pity because the film , based on the book vampire$ by john steakley , gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery  
this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film , but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it  
what carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires  
there is a lot of fighting and lots of gore  
anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans  
this has not always been carpenter's style  
his 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the film's central science fictional question  
jack crow heads a vampire swat team , cleaning up nests of vampires with high-tech spears and crossbows  
in the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek ( thomas ian griffith ) who has been tipped off to who crow is  
now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya ( daniel baldwin )  
to make matters worse , he does not know the people on his own side , tony and his backers , he can trust  
meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico  
if this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions , that's exactly what it is  
the same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin  
but carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film : show people , don't tell them  
just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown  
fundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding , why are the vampires in new mexico--what do they want and why do they want it , what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church , how did crow come to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to it ? 
the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized , but instead are revealed through dialog  
now if all this was not bad enough , carpenter misuses the james wood persona  
woods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well  
but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergio-leone- style mythic posturing  
while his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target  
woods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero  
that is not his style and it just does not work very well  
there are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses  
in one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor  
one female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair  
as the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down  
one also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret  
these vampires do not maintain a low profile  
there are arguably logical flaws in the film  
there is some question in my mind whether carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires  
it would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires , yet in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight "

-1,"kate ( jennifer aniston ) is having some problems  
it appears the twenty-eight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder , and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired  
she learns that her problems are related , as the owner of her advertising agency , mr  mercer ( kevin dunn ) , explains to her that her single status does not bode well with the company  
her freedom would make her more likely to leave the company , taking clients with her  
a solution presents itself in nick ( jay mohr ) , a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coincidence and gets photographed with  
kate's boss , darcy ( illeana douglas ) , uses the photograph to fabricate a wedding engagement between kate and nick  
kate is at first repulsed by the idea , but after getting immediate positive results , she pursues it  
her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan  
the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc ?  
at a dinner with kate's bosses he will provoke a fight and they will break up  
she meets nick to propose the plan  
he accepts  
kate's new status brings unexpected results in other areas  
the office bad boy , sam ( kevin bacon ) , who wouldn't give kate the time of day , now does  
now that she is engaged , he pursues an affair with her , as doing so would destroy her good girl image , hence sam's sudden interest  
things start to fall apart for kate , as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her , and does not wish to break up with her  
after some provoking nick does oblige , but problems continue for kate  
it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available  
or maybe kate does like nick , but "" reconciliation "" will force her to admit her lies to her employer  
adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother ( olympia dukakis ) , who wants her to get married and settle down  
there is a scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is ( from the waist up ) only wearing a bra  
it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one  
there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer  
it's like the director said 'well , we know the story is formulaic and the performances aren't that great so , what the heck , let's show jennifer's assets as often and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating  "" 
quite frankly it's insulting  
i don't think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie  
she did a decent enough job in ed burns' "" she's the one "" because it was a smaller and supporting role , and she just doesn't deliver the goods effectively in this movie  
her performance was not convincing  
unfortunately , as far as romantic comedies go , this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies  
the film is similar to "" my best friends wedding "" in a sense that the leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her actions , gets no sympathy from me when things go awry  
i didn't care for how quickly kate puts down nick's profession by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn't glamorous enough for her co-workers  
at least "" my best friends wedding "" changed the formula a bit and had a somewhat surprise ending  
no such luck with "" picture perfect ""  
every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away , including a couple that really made no sense  
after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company , why would she blindly throw it all away when she should have made sure that nick would even talk to her first , let alone consider a relationship ? 
was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick ? 
throw in the fact that i don't think nick and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of a decision  
i believe that kate liked him , but liked him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away ? 
i doubt it  
and what of the ending scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the couple ? 
are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers ? 
well , i guess of the congregation consists of movie extras and the strangers are the movies two lead stars , then that would make sense  
picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron

i * did * go into this one with high expectations  
i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks  
i sort of expected another exorcist or the shining  
i even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film  
boy , was i wrong ! 
another garbage slasher flick , the only difference being that * this * one has a story ! 
the story , you ask ? 
well , a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk  
he takes it home , somehow getting it past customs : - ) and starts fiddling with it in his attic  
lo and behold , after he takes it apart , three demons appear and start taking him apart , but with meat hooks  
when they're finished , his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling  
they botch up their cleanup job , however , and manage to leave his heart ( or some gland ; i didn't really recognize the organ ) under a floorboard  
the guy's brother and his brother's wife appear at the door soon after , and decide to move in  
they throw away scumball's belongings , and set up house  
turns out that wife is a bit of a nympho , and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage  
she starts having some wild hallucinations  
later , hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards ( slow-mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground--all from the tiny cut on his hand )  
said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumball's organ  
the organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing  
it establishes mind contact with wife , who agrees to help him get more blood , because she really wants to be screwed again  
so , she helps him kill three businessmen  
scumball , at this time , gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back  
problem is , he doesn't have any skin , and even after three or four corpses , still doesn't get any skin  
he finally gets some , though , but strangely enough , he ends up looking like his brother  
guess they couldn't get the original actor back  
who knows  
scumball ( whose name is frank ) is not a nice guy  
he describes his torture by the demons fondly , as the "" ultimate pleasure and pain , since at that level there is no difference between the two  "" 
somehow , i don't see getting torn apart by 90 fish- and meat-hooks a lot of fun  
this guy is * so * bad ( "" how bad * is * he ? "" ) , 
 * so * bad that the * rats * cower in a corner in fear  
for good reason , too ; he crucifies two of them for fun , and carves a third while the nympho's horsing around with hubby  
anyway  hubby's daughter ( who , if course , is not * wife's * daughter ) starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams  
the dumb bimbo meets scumball , and is not impressed  
she manages to escape with the chinese puzzle , and brings out the demons  
at any rate , the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup ; they're normally quite meticulous about that type of thing  
the story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake  
the demons are not , however , the good guys  
the dumb bimbo's the good guy  
she somehow not only gets them to take care of frank , but also banishes them to hell or oblivion , we're not too sure which  
not too shabby for someone with single-digit iq "

-1," ""    because i'm a scientist  
that's what we do ! "" 
--- dr  alexander mccabe ( bob gunton ) , in response to why he created evil bats  
alright folks , stop me if you've heard this one : genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals , assisted by a specialist in the particular animal's field , must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth  
oh yeah , the military is on their way to bomb the town as well , so they are running short on time  
sound familiar ? 
such is the plot of the destination films release of bats  
dina meyer stars as the "" bat specialist "" sheila , who is pulled from her research ( along with her annoying sidekick , played with irritating deftness by leon ) in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently  
with the help of the local sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) , a cdc official ( carlos jacott ) , and a scientist ( bob gunton ) , sheila discovers it is indeed bats ( who have been genetically altered by gunton's character to be more aggressive and omnivorous , in order to be used as a military weapon ! )  
i have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film  
there's not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good  
in this respect , the film never disappointed me  
this film reaches a level that transcends the "" so bad it's good "" level and borders on the downright insane  
the effects are awful , the script is contrived , and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously ( i think )  
i challenge anyone to sit through the scene , where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner , with a straight face  
thankfully , the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with  
dina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in ( johnny mnemonic , dragonheart , and starship troopers    
the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit ) , and this one is no exception  
while one never really gets the impression that meyer's character could be a bat expert in reality , one never really cares to doubt it either  
she gives as good a performance as could be expected , plus she's nice to look at for an hour and a half  
lou diamond phillips is also serviceable here , as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero  
although when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what's going on in town , for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats  
the only bad performance in the film is that of leon's  
he is relegated to the "" i'm not sticking around here ! "" 
character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays  
anyone who can't immediately tell that bob gunton ( the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films ) is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised , but i highly doubt it  
even if he hadn't been the villain in just about every film he's ever been in , so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever  
in fact , his death is welcome , because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale  
if the plot doesn't sound ridiculous to you yet , then check out these little tidbits : a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol  
an entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor's orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated , causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force , killing several townsfolk  
a government official blows off shelia's instructions ( to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats' cave that will kill all of them off ) by pulling a night job , resulting in the death of an entire military unit  
a cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it  
finally , to top it all off , this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it's single screen theater ( for reference , our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens , and we're lucky to even get kevin smith's dogma )  
the most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill-conceived bat puppets  
while the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing ( making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what's going on ) , the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more low-key  
therefore we the audience get loving close-ups of the most unrealistic , rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film "

-1,"writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard  
harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun  
harder than building a bridge over troubled waters  
and incidentally , a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review  
thrillers are all variations on a theme  
you have a smart , resourceful , and powerful bad guy , who has a goal he has to meet  
you have a noble and brave good guy , who has to protect the innocent , kill the bad guy , and not get killed himself in the process  
the trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner  
this simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest , high noon , or silence of the lambs , or big summer blockbusters like men in black , the fugitive , or air force one , or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds , event horizon , kull the conqueror     
is anyone else getting depressed here ? 
point is , it's not enough to follow the formula  
you've got to throw in something extra , something good and new and better than the last version  
something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals  
this is a hard thing to do , but it is absolutely necessary in every way  
without that something extra -- whether it's a great plot or a well-written screenplay , or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs -- the movie fails  
that's why the jackal , with all its starpower , with all its budget , with all its hype , gets a big fat f  
bruce willis is the bad guy , the jackal , a legendary killer for hire  
richard gere is the good guy , a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal  
the jackal is trying to kill someone  
gere is trying to stop him  
will gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal ? 
 ( i'll give you three guesses , and the first two don't count  ) 
there are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal , no moment when you say to yourself , "" i wonder what happens next ? "" 
the script for the jackal isn't ripped straight from today's headlines  
it's ripped off , straight from an episode of millennium  
throughout the movie , we learn what the jackal's plans are and how he intends to accomplish them  
no surprise  
the fun of a movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackal's plan is and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy  
instead , we get two ( count 'em , two ) scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackal's plan just as if he's frank black ( or more likely , just as if he's been handed a copy of the script )  
and we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight  
it's like gere's character is psychic , but neither he nor the fbi ( or the screenwriters ) seem to know it  
and just like in millennium , the bad guy has an overwhelming need to go after the people the good guy cares about , whether or not they are important to what he's trying to do or not  
what's more , in the last half of the movie , the jackal , supposedly a super-smart professional terrorist who never makes a mistake , comes down with a major case of the stupids  
as for the performances    
bruce willis manages to get through the whole movie without a wisecrack , which is a major achievement , but not enough reason to see the movie  
his disguises are good , but not as good or as interesting as val kilmer's in the saint  
richard gere is made to talk the entire movie in an irish accent , which detracts from his otherwise lifeless and dull performance "

-1,"i read the new yorker magazine and i enjoy some of their really in-depth articles about some incident  
they will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail  
it becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested , and what kind of pressure the investigators are under , and just about any other aspect you can think of  
frequently i get the feeling that the article sounded exciting , but i am being told in more detail than i really wanted to know  
often i get to the middle of a story and say , ok , it sounded good but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject  
film is a different medium  
it is a visual medium  
that slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize  
i frequently am surprised to find out how short a film script is and how much of the pages are empty space  
the magazine article and the film script are two very different media  
the insider is a film adaptation of the vanity fair article "" the man who knew too much "" by marie brenner  
it is too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film  
it really verges on being tedious at least at times  
for years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy side-effects  
but they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it  
the business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco  
the tide turned when a former vice-president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking  
the resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at cbs  
who were the major people involved , what were their motives , how was the story almost killed , how did it get aired anyway ? 
that is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider  
this all could have been enthralling , but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well  
and in the end , he failed  
to make a long story short , the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short  
the film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist  
we get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand  
they go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace ( played by christopher plummer )  
there the news team under producer lowell bergman ( al pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it  
this seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story , but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists , we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world  
terrorists can grab the headlines , but the tobacco companies have the real position of power  
incongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home  
we discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly  
he had been a very profitably rewarded vice-president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco ; now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family  
rather than support him his wife liane ( diane venora ) demands of him what are they supposed to do for income  
meanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand  
they offer wigand $12 , 000 just to interpret the data  
wigand's severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings , but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms  
he is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman  
in spite of the secrecy , wigand's former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role  
and so the game begins  
wigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer "

-1,"capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence  
visually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver's travels and treat it as an action film  
that makes it a film without much center  
 , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 
pierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a  k  a  monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire  
it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver's travels  
humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift's island of the houyhnhnms  
the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet  
it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that  
when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish  
the final irony of the original version has become film history  
without it there could never have been a "" planet of the apes "" film series  
i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language  
in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language  
that could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking  
serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film  
justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending  
but serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear  
few viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history  
partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith's best if not his best  
when the film's success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s  
while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases  
the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973  
now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again  
for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton's new version is even less faithful  
first , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes  
he has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes  
that could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes  
as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring  
in 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world's most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes  
then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet  
 ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect  ) 
he quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks  
and the language they talk is earth- english  
apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that  
the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn't occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film  
both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english "

a film which can easily be guessed out by the end of frame number one  
a film which is packed to the cap with predictability , leading to very little tension , excitement , suspense or interest on the part of its paying audience  
in short , a clich ? -ridden formula film  
welcome to my review of the general's daughter  
plot : an undercover army detective and a rape counselor find themselves locked inside an investigation into some bigwig general daughter's rape , torture and murder  
they must delve through all of the unspoken army rules and the hush-hushes , to figure out the conspiracy behind the shocking murder  
critique : by the numbers ( see above )  
this film is just there  
it sits there on the big screen for a couple of hours , floats around , goes away , hopefully never to be heard from again  
it is so predictable that even a blind man could see its plot points coming a mile away  
it's as suspenseful as a leaf dropping from a tree  
it's as action-packed as a canadian curling tournament  
get the picture ? 
i sure did    it's 
too bad that it took my friend and i less than two minutes to figure out the entire plot , and to break down each scene before it was even completed  
easy as pie  
it's unfortunate because james woods and john travolta actually have one extremely enjoyable scene together near the beginning of the film , but alas , t'was not to be ( that scene alone scored two of my four points allotted  ) 
woods chews it up in the few scenes that he's in , travolta passes the test , cromwell plays , well , cromwell , and stowe is window dressing with a smile ( mia since 12 monkeys ( 8/10 ) it seems )  
and this predictability isn't reserved only to those who have seen films like courage under fire or a few good men , it runs deep inside every one of us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug on the big screen  
it's like riding a bike  
other scenarios which sponge out any tension , suspense or interest from this film include every single character eventually "" breaking down "" to the investigators without much reason given , a ridiculously placed background relationship between two of the lead characters , as much action as my grandparents bedroom nightly , and a directorial style that can only reward director simon west with a solid nomination for the "" best poor man's michael bay doing his best poor man's impression of tony scott "" ( add two scenes with sunlight shining through some half-open shades for grit and integrity , and an all-out rainfall for the finale for further chaos , and you're a great director  
yawn  
yeah , whatever tony    i 
mean , simon  ) 
and aren't we all sick of hearing about these army "" bad boys "" and their overdone "" code of silence "" ? ! 
enough already ! 
next subject , please  
see it on video if you wanna fall asleep after seeing a much better movie like an officer and a gentleman ( 8  5/10 )  
otherwise , save yourself the trouble and go take a crap instead  
you'll feel much better afterwards  
trust me  
little known facts about this film and its stars : ironically , john travolta turned down the lead role in an officer and a gentleman , which eventually went to little dickie gere  
ironically on james woods' part , he completed one of his earliest acting roles on tv's "" welcome back , kotter "" , starring none other than john travolta  
actor james woods recently confirmed reports of his "" big dick "" on howard stern's radio program  
unlike rocker tommy lee , woods is also alleged to have an iq of 180

 "" meet joe black "" is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year , with a cinematography , music and cast that will dazzle most of us  
at the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season  
at first you marvel at the elegant direction , graceful cinematography and sensual musical score  
then you'll wait for something to happen for half an hour , but when you finally understand what's going on , you'll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins , brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in a film like this ? 
the script is simply a silly and unresolved story , which is artificially stretched into a three hour long motion picture  
it feels like an eternity  
most of the time it is a pompous soap opera , filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in a high pitched voice and "" meaningful "" winks  
the film is based on alberto caesella's play "" death takes a holiday ""  
the story concentrates around bill ( anthony hopkins ) who lives a fulfilled life as a successful business man , but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears a voice that is saying "" yes ""  
soon he meets a young elegant gentlemen ( brad pitt ) who introduces himself as "" death ""  
it is bill's time  
but death has other plans  
it has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive  
our bill is chosen to be death's guide and in exchange he gets time  
bill introduces death as joe black , who immediately becomes the center of everyone's attention  
bill's business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bill's side , lives in his house and resides at his office  
that is not all , however  
bill's youngest daughter susan ( claire forlani ) falls in love with the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love with her  
this relationship is bound to have some serious consequences  
it wouldn't be fair to say that this film didn't have some interesting moments , such as the scene where joe is invited to join bill's family for dinner  
when joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love , the experience is somewhat different  
it is obvious that a story like this story is very difficult to structure  
it's one thing to say : "" wouldn't it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth   "" 
to create a motion picture out of this is another  
four screenwriters have worked on a script that lacks drive and logic  
it is overlong and too primitive to pass as a serious film  
on the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and a very decent direction by martin brest ( "" scent of a woman "" )  
hopkins looks great in any role , and no matter how shallow or hollow it is , he will complete it  
his talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else , since it actually saves the film from a complete embarrassment  
but pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time  
how can you play death in human form ? 
to me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters  
they are not creatures , but phenomenas  
saying that death takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would take human form  
handling such a ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work  
speaking in a calm , soft voice , portraying death as a lonely , distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters  
he looks and acts more like an angel of death , rather than a demon or a red-eyed executioner  
claire forlani and others are also fine , stretching their stereotypical characters to their limits  
unfortunately their performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self inflicted misery "

patch adams a film review by michael redman copyright 1999 by michael redman 
mediocrity is a pox on civilization  
in our heavily consumer oriented society , there is an enormous demand to churn out "" stuff  "" 
what would happen to our economy if we didn't feel the need to have more things ? 
to make us buy more , businesses need to produce a ton of product  
the sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality  
the film industry is like any other  
in order for studios to survive , they have to make money  
the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit  
some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that , less talented people are used  
there aren't enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary  
for some reason , it's never crossed anyone's mind that the real equation is quality films = more profit  
often , mediocre films are more of a pain for the audience than the horrendous ones  
at you can have a good time making fun of bad movies  
i'm not suggesting that "" patch adams "" was tossed out just to rake in the bucks  
my guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel  
it features an accomplished actor and a potentially engrossing story , but it's as dull as could be  
hunter "" patch "" adams' ( robin williams ) desire to become a doctor has an unusual genesis  
checking himself into a mental institute after a suicide attempt , he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning around  
patch could be a poster boy for co-dependency  
he explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he doesn't focus on his own problems  
he decides that he wants to be a physician , leaves the place and a couple of years later enrolls in the medical college of virginia  
as a med student , patch's antics at the school's hospital catch the attention of his soon to be arch-enemy , straight-laced dean walcott ( bob gunton )  
the dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school although he's one of the top students  
he writes in patch's academic file that he shows "" excessive happiness  "" 
i walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing  
there also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the early seventies  
then it struck me  
it must be based on a true story  
the movie is an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute , a free clinic  
robin williams is an amazing actor  
while he is adept at dramatic roles , his forte is over-the-top free spirits  
that's what makes his failure here so remarkable  
patch is exactly the character he should be best at , yet even the scene where he and another mental patient are battling fierce imaginary squirrels falls flat  
something holds him back  
most of the rest of the cast is two-dimensional  
for a film that champions seeing patients as human beings , it's curious that the ones here are cardboard characters  
peter coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like a real person  
unfortunately he's in the film for only about two minutes  
the audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene  
we're not left to our own emotional decisions : we're hit over the head with them "
-1," "" with all that education , you should know what happiness is  "" 
starring sylvia chang , teresa hu , hsu ming , li lieh , mao hsueh-wei ; directed by edward yang ; written by yang and wu nien-chen ; cinematography by christopher doyle and chang hui-kung 
every country has , eventually , its new wave  
france had its nouvelle vague , brazil its cinema novo , china its fifth generation , and on and on  
some waves just take longer than others , before they wash over us , cleansing us with the balm of discovery  
taiwan's new wave came in the 1980s , in the work of directors like hou hsiao-hsien , wan jen , and edward yang ; that day , on the beach--yang's first feature--is central  
it created a new language for young taiwanese directors , even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and faltering  
later works refined the techniques that yang first explored here , giving taiwan a distinctive international presence  
that day itself is long and frustrating , the document of a nation's attempt to find a voice  
it does not lack ambition  
it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan , in the manner of antonioni , elaborating the alienation that the westernized white-collar middle-class feel as their lives are shaped by old-fashioned roles--dedicated career men , loyal housewives--that they find unfulfilling  
jia-li ( sylvia chang ) is the focus , but the film brings others into its compass--her husband , her brother , friends from her college days--as it charts her discontents  
no one is happy  
jia-li married her husband , we-lei , at a young age  
at the time , her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage , despite his affection for another woman , and so jia-li's marriage seemed , in comparison , a good one : she chose we-lei of her own free will , they loved each other  
but it goes wrong  
that day dutifully presents all the clich ? s : we-lei becomes absorbed in his career , indulges in an affair with a co-worker ; jia-li feels restless and trapped , bound by a choice she made while young , but which no longer seems wise  
the film never redeems these clich ? s by conveying the feel of authentic experience , the intensity of lived pain , and much of it seems trite and belaboured  
it unfolds , awkwardly , as a series of flashbacks , told during a luncheon in vienna , where jia-li meets her brother's old flame ( teresa hu ) , now a concert pianist , whom she has not seen since college  
both women seem rather sad , and resigned to their sadness  
their circumstances ( and those of jia-li's brother and a college friend ) suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices--married the wrong man , chosen the wrong career path , etc  --but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate  
it is not that jia-li married the wrong man ; she didn't  
the problem is that she needed to marry at all--and that if she did not marry , she would still be just as unhappy  
for a woman in modern taiwan , that day tells us , the cards are stacked , the dice are loaded : she can play the game , but the house always wins  
the film's sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan  
seen now , it does not seem provocative  
indeed , it's hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy : it may be ambitious , it may be innovative , but it is also terribly , terribly dull  
and what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us : yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others , and his use of those methods is fumbling , uncertain , undisciplined  
nor does he bring anything new--other than the locale--to the material  
there are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for--in a young couple's first kiss , in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husband's mistress--but they are brief  
too often , yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes--grocery shopping , flower-arranging--in which nothing happens , little is said , no emotion imparted  
perhaps , if the film were content to focus on such reflective , inward moments , leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings , it might have been ambiguous , suggestive , insinuating  
but jia-li and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence : they talk about their problems , at length , in detail , redundantly , and eliminate all subtleties  
at two hours and forty-five minutes , it all seems exorbitantly long , indulgently long-winded  
consider the defining moment for jia-li , the titular day on the beach  
the thrust of the whole film explains , easily enough , what we are to think of that moment , what it means when she walks away from a particular situation  
even so , the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally , in case we may have missed the point  
needless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed , and that is the problem throughout  
the look of the film is as tedious as the drawn-out narrative "

making a pact with malebolgia , a chief demon there , simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn , a general in hell's army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives , chains , and a morphing cape  
sullen , wise cogliostro and flatulating , wisecracking violator vy for spawn's attention  
comments : when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics ( where he had made a name for himself as a first-rate comic book penciller on the "" spider-man "" titles ) to join the newly-formed , creator-owned image comics , a new comic book legend was born : spawn  
mcfarlane's "" spawn "" immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s  
mcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate , allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max  
the early "" spawn "" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane's genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing  
with the popularity of "" spawn "" and the success of the current warner bros  's batman film franchise , a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn  
in the summer of 1997 , hence , new line cinema released spawn , a live-action film based on the groundbreaking series  
this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book , like me , numbed by how much spawn misses the mark  
what happened ? 
why is spawn so bad ? 
todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo  
i don't think , however , that his presence necessarily hurt ( or helped ) the film  
i place the blame , in part , on the recent hollywood trend , fueled by public demand apparently , for special effects blow-out movies utilizing the latest computer technology  
these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else : character , plot , dialogue , etc  spawn , reflecting this trend , shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics  
hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires , explosions , knives and chains appearing out of nowhere , glowing eyes , or constantly transforming demons  
a lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid , don't get me wrong , but , because the script and cast aren't engaging , spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper ( the surface may capture the eye , but nothing exists underneath )  
spawn's translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level  
mcfarlane's spawn was a tortured hero  
a mercenary by trade , al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda  
having died and journeyed to hell , he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda  
simmons , however , discovers that his memories are fragmented , his body a creepy mess , and his wife married  
despite his sometimes violent nature , readers couldn't help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld  
spawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so  
when the characters are developed , they seem absurd rather than touching  
the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot ( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat-16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world ) do not help matters  
spawn , in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman , also unwisely spends too much time on a villain , the violator ( batman favored the joker over batman )  
john leguizamo , like jack nicholson in batman , receives top billing in the cast as the violator ; michael jai white ( al simmons / spawn ) is second  
i ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator  
the film , however , spends so much time on the violator's offensive antics that they grate on the nerves  
apparently meant to be the comic relief in the film ( as nicholson was in batman ) , especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn , the violator's lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny , leaving the audience wishing he would leave  
leguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role , but he is seen far too often in the film  
michael jai white , a relative newcomer to theatrical releases , seems to be an appealing actor , and he handles his role adequately , but we see little of him without various masks on  
more time needed to be spent on white's character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings  
a special note should be made about martin sheen as the over-the-top , obnoxious , evil general wynn  
easily the hammiest performance in the movie , it's hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much ; after all , he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now  
sheen's excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film  
many other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down "

-1,"the haunting , a film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of a horror film : to scare us  
if you've ever seen a movie , which you probably have considering you are on this website , you should know about all of the trivia they post before a movie  
they have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film  
but , the one i always like are the &quot ; other name&quot ; joke that try and rename a particular film  
for instance , the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film , small soldiers  
they had titles like little infantry and can i get those fatigues in a smaller size ? 
well , after seeing the haunting , i had a few particular names for it as well  
unfortunately , i can only post one of them , otherwise , i'd be getting some pretty angry e-mails from overprotective mothers  
that title would be the confusing  
ok , that is a pretty bad title , but it fits this film perfectly  
it basically serves up no purpose , and combined with dry dialogue and a boring and confusing plot , it completes the formula for a cinematic bomb  
liam neeson once again gets wrapped up in a film without any depth , but at least the phantom menace was exciting and had some depth  
the haunting is nothing but trash , but unfortunately , will still make a boatload of money  
before i rant and rave about how bad this film is , let me point out the few , and i stress the word few , bright spots in this film  
first , the house is great- looking  
it looks beautiful , but this is also a dark spot  
it looks so great that it is hard to be frightened by it  
this is something that rears its ugly head at all points of the film  
things look so great , that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight  
haunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful and that is being eerie  
the hill house is not eerie  
it is beautiful , but not the least bit frightening  
ever heard of lili taylor ? 
before this film i did not , but i am glad that i do now  
she gives the only satisfactory performance in the film  
despite the dry dialogue and boring/confusing concept , she manages to light up the screen every time she appears , but unfortunately , her co-stars are usually following right behind  
owen wilson , who plays luke , is the only other cast member even close to giving an admirable performance , other then taylor  
he is basically there for the comic relief , and his character development is poor in all other areas  
all of the characters are desperately underdeveloped  
wilson had potential as luke , but it seems they just needed him to add a few laughs  
liam neeson and catherine zeta-jones suffer from the dialogue and plot and should not have been in this film  
their characters must suffer from wicked mood swings because in each scene they turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave and whatnot  
they just are not believable and this is the final nail in the haunting's coffin  
the plot is terrible  
the opening scene of the film is very important , but the director makes it too obvious by getting close-ups of all the things that will play a major role in the end of the film  
as i sat through the film , i kept wondering what this film was trying to accomplish  
nell , lili taylor's character , goes from the hunted to the savior  
it makes no sense and the director gives the audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that take place in the film  
he forces the viewer to make various assumptions and does not give any in-depth information  
for instance , the beginning of the film gives us a sense of why nell is getting involved in the program  
but , we get zilch for the other four "
-1,"mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival  
as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival  
it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time  
in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry  
toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart  
the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it  
something else is what he did  
the film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life  
she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep  
meanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada  
she wants to build a career as an actress  
betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow  
she does not know who the woman is  
she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is  
they fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not  
meanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own  
he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george )  
these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong  
there is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion  
in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits  
a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun  
lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film  
he just chooses not to  
as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason  
there are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches  
the film is a little long for the subject matter  
toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot  
unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers  
i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale  
mulholland drive spoiler warning  
i have rated this film fairly low  
you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film  
david lynch is in large part a dark satirist  
most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside  
in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre  
what he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? ) 
playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on  
the first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout  
then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something  
the audience expectation is that they will add up "

and , in the future , it's also the name of a spaceship that vanished when it tried to go faster than the speed of light by traversing through its own portable black hole  
naturally , this is the setup for the other event horizon    
the movie  
when the ship suddenly appears at the point that it vanished at , just outside of neptune , the crew of the ship called the "" lewis and clark "" has to go to investigate , and dr  william weir , the creator of the "" event horizon , "" gets to come along for the ride  
if you've glanced at a poster for this movie , you know that , supposedly , what follows is "" infinite terror  "" 
well , i don't know about the "" terror "" part , but "" infinite "" certainly seems to qualify    
event horizon is a mean-spirited , gory , sick excuse for a film  
it starts off as an alien rip-off , and then degenerates into a pointlessly bloody slasher flick after about 40 minutes  
at least for those first 40 minutes it's an * interesting * rip-off of alien  
that's a lot more than can be said for the rest of them movie , which seems to go on forever  
it not a scary monster movie , nor is it a psychological thriller  
it is simply a movie which tries again and again to make the viewers feel sick to their stomach at the site of extreme gore  
you've seen this kind of movie before  
the hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing this sensibility  
this is a kind of movie for which i have no respect , a kind of movie which i had hoped died out years ago  
it is quite possible for a movie to frighten or shock its audience without resorting to nothing more than gore , but event horizon takes the low road , and the viewers pay the price  
there are many good , respectable performances , from fishburne and neill most noticably  
paul anderson's direction is impressive , as it was in mortal kombat  
there are many nice special effects , mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around in zero-gravity  
the sets are beautiful to gaze upon  
and richard t  jones' character ( cooper ) is hilarious and extremely likable ( more so than most characters i've seen in recent movies ) for the little screen time that he has  
and none of this can save the movie from being a d-grade level of film  
the idea of a ship that has some sort of life within its walls , a life that knows the fears and inner skeletons of the human passengers , is a promising one  
a haunted house story in space isn't such a bad idea  
but the final execution is extremely disappointing  
that's not to say that philip eisner ( here making his feature film-writing debut ) doesn't have talent  
for those first 40 minutes , he manages to make a tired premise interesting , adding in aspects of unique flavor into a rip-off story , and that's something that not too many writers can do  
he even has one scene that , though it also tries to sicken the audience , has a honestly tense feel to it ( the scene in question deals with one of the crew being in an airlock while others try to save him from floating into space )  
he definitely has something of a gift , but it's not fully on display here  
i certainly will look forward to seeing more from him , and i hope that his future work fully explores his talent and the story possibilities of the premise "
-1,"i didn't hate the big hit , even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film  
for the entirety of its running time , my eyes were attached to the screen , and i never once got bored  
i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it's entertaining to watch it in the same way that it's entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl  
as a narrative , the big hit is pure garbage , never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries  
it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank , which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways  
it's fine to mix genres , if the film makers know what they're doing  
unfortunately , writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don't seem to know how to handle the material , and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy  
the biggest problem with the amalgamation , in this case , is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place  
but it sure is a fascinating failure  
marky  
  
  
er , mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley , a hitman  
he's a good hitman , apparently , although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious ( he doesn't snipe or make clean kills--he just kicks the door down and shoots everything )  
he works with a few other hitmen--cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) , crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) , and vinnie ( antonio sabbato , jr  )  
they're a nice bunch of muscular guys , who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex  
they all work for a man named paris ( avery brooks ) , who is rich , powerful , and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen  
it is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own ; this , of course , is where the plot comes in  
they decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko ( china chow ) , who has a rich father  
when they do this , it turns out she is paris'  
  
  
goddaughter ! 
it's very bad to have paris against you  
the story is standard action film stuff  
it's nothing new , and nothing particularly offensive ( but certainly not the slightest bit compelling )  
clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it's a john woo-type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy  
it's true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face/off and the replacement killers , which are both far superior )  
there are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story  
they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns  
melvin is also very good at breakdancing , and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives  
like i said , it's not boring ; most disasters aren't  
what makes it so bad is its genre-shifting madness  
it seems to start out as a quirky-but-realistic action comedy , as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains  
then , as soon as they go to their first hit , it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere  
then , somewhere in between , it turns back into comedy  
keiko turns out to be a spunky little girl ; in one amusing scene , she is forced to read a letter out loud , indicating that she has been kidnapped , but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words  
and scenes like this work alone , but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious , or not be in the film at all  
one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped ; when cisco gets there , paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it , but they let him out of there , telling him to find the perpetrator "

-1,"renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean-claude van damme on the action star's 1997 pairing with dennis rodman , _double_team_ , and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick , stylish , and somewhat diverting action timekiller  
tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels , _knock_off_ , but this time around , style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous , and at worst incomprehensible ; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances  
writer steven e  desouza's fairly straightforward plotline isn't as outre as _double_team_'s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison , but it makes about as much sense , which is little  
van damme plays marcus ray , a hong kong-based sales rep for a jeans company ( ! ) who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip-sized bombs in hk product exports to the u  s  --dolls , electronic equipment , and , yes , jeans  
it's all part of some type of ransom scheme , but all i remember is--and i kid you not--graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world , bombs detonating , and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter    
    which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_  
while all of van damme's films have its share of unintentional laughs , mostly due to the stiff acting "" skills "" of the physically agile van damme , _knock_off_ delivers more than usual ( though not as many as van damme's embarrassing directorial effort , 1996's _the_quest_ )  
a lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza : "" i smoked that badass like a roman candle ! "" 
and "" entrepreneurship , babycakes ! "" 
standing out among my favorites  
but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _knock_off_'s laughs  
van damme is true to laughable form , perhaps even worse than usual  
early scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with co-star rob schneider ( improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus's business partner ) , and the sight and sound of the still-heavily-accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way  
even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug  
paul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneider's cia superior ; and lela rochon , playing an investigator for the jeans company , spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode  
in rochon's defense , though , her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs , exquisite bone structure , and perky bosoms , the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage  
tsui picks up where he left off visually in _double_team_ , juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work  
here , though , tsui's visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill , coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise  
for each nifty trick tsui pulls off , such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices , there are others that are completely superfluous  
this is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context  
for instance , one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box  
as he puts his hand in , the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen  
it's undoubtedly an interesting visual , but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something  
the test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences , but surprisingly , those in _knock_off_ leave much to be desired  
tsui does what he can to make something of them , employing freeze frames , blurred motion , and unconventional camera angles , but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza  
there isn't anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger/land mine fight in _double_team_ , let alone anything remotely close to tsui's legendary hong kong works ( but that's a given going in )  
if tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo's stateside success , he would do best to break free from van damme    
before it's too late  
if he continues his involvement with b-grade movies such as _knock_off_ , the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish   "
-1,"five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a strange box gets delivered there ( is this starting to sound familiar ? ) by mistake  
the girls accidentlly open the box ( big surprise , huh ! ) and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one ( betcha didn't see that one coming ! )  
hard to die , i found out while watching the film , is a sequel to sorority house massacre 2 : nightie nightmare ( r  a  m  r  # 
1521 )  
two of the actresses from sorority house massacre 2 are in this film , robyn harris and melissa moore , but they play different characters here  
orville ketchum is also back as ( get ready for this ) orville ketchum ( yes , the same character from number two )  
yes , he is also built like a tank in this film too  
i'm telling you , a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn't harm him at all ! 
the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act , well they seemed to have lost that ability  
thankfully , for my sanity , i also saw the film warlock , which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film  
the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks  
any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line  
the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out , analyzed , and discarded before it happens  
there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot  
while we are on the subject of the story , the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress  
the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager's office  
i'm sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary , ridiculous , and hurts the story more ( if that is still possible )  
the script for this film is completely pathetic  
the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible  
the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along  
here is an example of the wonderful dialog  
the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a * really * big gun  
the line is "" my dad used to be a marine , i bet i can work it  "" 
this line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy  
now , we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan ( ? ! ! ? ) has been presented  
one comment from an actress is "" not a lot of strategy involved , but i like it  "" 
i'm afraid folks that this is about as good as they get  
now lets talk about the great special effects for this film  
this obviously wasn't a big concern of the film makers  
the killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewer's intelligence  
a girl gets hacked with a knife and enough blood comes out to do one friday the 13th movie  
are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get ? 
the continuity department was obviously asleep ( along with the viewers ) when watching this film  
in one shot , actress has cloths on , camera angle changes , actress seems to have lost clothing  
very impressive trick ! 
the one ( half ? ) 
plus that this film has going for it , is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious  
the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny , and so the viewer can get some enjoyment ( ? ! ! ? ) from the film  
however , this doesn't make it worth the rental fee of over a penny  
in the acting department , the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down "
