-1,"welcome to your oh-so typical sequel  
it tries to be twice as big as it's predecessor , yet ends up twice as shallow  
shallow     hmm    now there's an idea  
maybe if the ill-fated cruise liner in this movie had struck a shallow reef early on things may have turned out better  
the first thing that struck me    and 
surprised me , was that the camera work ( for the opening sequence anyway ) was terrible  
looked like the cameramen were drunk and kept tripping on their own feet       very 
different to the original movie  
the characters ? 
well , not many of the characters actually * had * characters , but here's a rundown  
annie , who was the highlight of the the original , must have seriously banged her head in the train crash at the end of the first movie  
why ? 
because something's got to account for her losing that many iq points  
even though annie wasn't exactly a rocket scientist in speed , here some of her actions just make you want to beat your head against a wall  
for instance , after successfully using a chainsaw to cut a hole in a door so that a group of people can escape noxious gases - she stands in the middle of the opening for about five minutes till someone reminds her that the people can't get ut till she get's the chainsaw out of their faces     bang 
bang bang 
in point of fact sandra's character is turned into little more than one of those scantly dressed extras from hercules , who constantly has to be rescued  
jason patric ? 
all i can say is bring back keanu  
keanu reeves might have the emotional range of a tree stump    but 
that's one more tree stump than jason has  
i don't think he changed facial expressions all movie - jason , smile for the cameras ! ! 
now frown !    i said frown     oh    you are    bang 
bang bang   
wooden just doesn't describe this guys performance , but it'll have to do  
the bad guy      ahh    william 
dafoe - there's a bright move  
how can you go wrong with the star from that acknowledged classic , body of evidence ? 
 ( yes , that is sarcasm )  
his wide eyed maniac of a character doesn't start out too bad     but 
goes steadily downhill as the movie progresses  
in the end he degenerates to chasing annie around for a hostage , even though he already has the money and can escape     bang 
bang  
though i'd like to give this movie a double thumbs down , there were some nice sequences  
considering the movie cost over 100 million dollars - you'd hope there'd be at least a couple  
the real eye-popper for me , even though it was given away in the trailer     bang 
bang      was the sequence where the cruise liner sideswipes the oil tanker  
this looks terrific and i was very surprised to hear that the cruise liner in it was     completely 
computer generated ! 
wow     i 
don't think i've ever seen a cg model look so real before  
the sequence where jason patric in trying to disable the propellers from under the ship is also terrific , and the only time during the entire movie where you get that feeling of     speed  
this lack-of-speed problem affects many sequences  
such as the oil tanker part      it was - "" oh no , we're going to hit the oil tanker ! "" , 
20 minutes later - "" oh no , we're going to hit the oil tanker ! "" 
20 min     you 
get the point  
this movie failed simply because it didn't live up to it's name     there 
was very little feeling of speed  
in the original movie , the lead characters had to make split second decisions to survive      in this movie it felt more like - "" well people , we're gonna run into that there island in a few hours - i think i might stroll over to engineering and see if i can't turn off the engines    i'm 
passing the cafeteria on the way , can i get anybody anything ? "" 
the ending of this movie really is terrible  
even though it features what i've since found out is one of the most expensive sequences ever in a movie - it just doesn't work at all  
the part where the liner crashes through the town looks very realistic , but     surprise 
surprise - it just takes waaaaay too long  
it seemed to go for 15 minutes before the ship finally stopped  
one thing that struck me as extremely poor scriptiing was that as the ship crashes through the harbour and town , around 25 people are killed by the ship     and 
there's only 15 or so people left on the ship  
so when it stops safe and sound and the characters are all cheering - the audience is sitting back and thinking - "" wait a sec   "

-1,"kate ( jennifer aniston ) is having some problems  
it appears the twenty-eight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder , and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired  
she learns that her problems are related , as the owner of her advertising agency , mr  mercer ( kevin dunn ) , explains to her that her single status does not bode well with the company  
her freedom would make her more likely to leave the company , taking clients with her  
a solution presents itself in nick ( jay mohr ) , a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coincidence and gets photographed with  
kate's boss , darcy ( illeana douglas ) , uses the photograph to fabricate a wedding engagement between kate and nick  
kate is at first repulsed by the idea , but after getting immediate positive results , she pursues it  
her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan  
the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc ?  
at a dinner with kate's bosses he will provoke a fight and they will break up  
she meets nick to propose the plan  
he accepts  
kate's new status brings unexpected results in other areas  
the office bad boy , sam ( kevin bacon ) , who wouldn't give kate the time of day , now does  
now that she is engaged , he pursues an affair with her , as doing so would destroy her good girl image , hence sam's sudden interest  
things start to fall apart for kate , as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her , and does not wish to break up with her  
after some provoking nick does oblige , but problems continue for kate  
it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available  
or maybe kate does like nick , but "" reconciliation "" will force her to admit her lies to her employer  
adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother ( olympia dukakis ) , who wants her to get married and settle down  
there is a scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is ( from the waist up ) only wearing a bra  
it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one  
there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer  
it's like the director said 'well , we know the story is formulaic and the performances aren't that great so , what the heck , let's show jennifer's assets as often and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating  "" 
quite frankly it's insulting  
i don't think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie  
she did a decent enough job in ed burns' "" she's the one "" because it was a smaller and supporting role , and she just doesn't deliver the goods effectively in this movie  
her performance was not convincing  
unfortunately , as far as romantic comedies go , this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies  
the film is similar to "" my best friends wedding "" in a sense that the leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her actions , gets no sympathy from me when things go awry  
i didn't care for how quickly kate puts down nick's profession by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn't glamorous enough for her co-workers  
at least "" my best friends wedding "" changed the formula a bit and had a somewhat surprise ending  
no such luck with "" picture perfect ""  
every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away , including a couple that really made no sense  
after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company , why would she blindly throw it all away when she should have made sure that nick would even talk to her first , let alone consider a relationship ? 
was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick ? 
throw in the fact that i don't think nick and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of a decision  
i believe that kate liked him , but liked him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away ? 
i doubt it  
and what of the ending scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the couple ? 
are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers ? 
well , i guess of the congregation consists of movie extras and the strangers are the movies two lead stars , then that would make sense  
picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron 
kate                         jennifer aniston nick                         jay 
mohr sam                         kevin 
bacon mercer                      kevin
