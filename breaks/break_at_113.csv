1,"most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts  
my family , for the most part , hates him and his movies  
i think he's very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years  
so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of  
unrestrained by physical boundaries , allen's humor comes shining through  
those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen's intelligent observations of life  
those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one  
in 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they'd never seen before  
toy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present  
many critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture  
antz , however , has upped the ante considerably  
disney's a bug's life isn't due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal  
by beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience's thirst for computer-animated films  
but don't let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared  
in the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios  
in 1997 , it was the volcano duel  
in my opinion , dante's peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality  
volcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations  
in 1998 , there are twice as many competing films  
first was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it's cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact  
but now , it's even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks )  
who will prevail ? 
time will tell , but i'm sure that mr  mouse has nothing to fear  
this may sound like i didn't like antz ; on the contrary , i'd put it up there with toy story  
but due to it's pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn't appear in disney's version  
some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film  
sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd  
the humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended  
this is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents  
antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen's shtick and franz kafka's metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug  
z ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker  
 "" when you're the middle child in a family of five million    "" he comments about his neglected childhood  
one night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life  
in walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown  
bala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader  
after discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there's a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony  
in order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants  
but to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her  
he and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed  
the queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony  
meanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him  
so z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites  
the battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence  
however , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence  
the second half of the film revolves around z's kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia  
there , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants  
the adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass  
looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i'm just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally )  
the ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground  
visually , it's an exciting rush of adrenaline  
but don't be fooled    
little kids shouldn't see this , as they may just try and copy it  
after seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again  
hopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel  
as an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date  
visually , it's as stunning as what dreams may come  
the best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren't limited by gravity  
they can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible  
one great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball  
the animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball  
however , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy's shoe  
it's truly a great example of film making at its finest  
with computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices  
the best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover )  
at one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores    
do they ? )  
barbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body  
young kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course )  
disney's a bug's life looks good , but i don't know if they will be able to best dreamworks' newest animated feature in terms of animation  
if not , then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do : go head to head with the big mouse , and knock him down ( yes , anastasia was good , but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney )  
vocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line-ups seen since toy story  
in fact , it far exceeds that one  
woody allen has always been funny , but here he transcends most of what he's done in the past few years  
without a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing  
in fact , i'm pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines  
sharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress  
sylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star  
after a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is  
gene hackman is superb as the gruff-talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona  
christopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns  
anne bancroft has a minimal role , but she's effective nonetheless  
danny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job  
dan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro-trash bees--both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd  
jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people won't recognize her voice either  
many people will recognize grant shaud's voice as the foreman  
he played miles on the tv show murphy brown  
this is definitely a huge cast with some high-profile names , and it will definitely help it's grosses  
of course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $60 million budget went to , also  
directors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers ( though guterman did direct a 1994 feature , headless ! )  
but both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture  
tense at times , and very funny throughout , the two hold this film together like professionals  
the screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot , but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults  
kids will delight in the animation , while parents can laugh heartily at the humor  
most of it will go over young children's heads  
does that mean you shouldn't take kids to see it ? 
not at all  
they will have a lot of fun watching this one  
what is great is the themes that are given to us  
part social commentary , part romance story , and part moral drama , antz gives everyone something to talk about , whether it be the animation , or the discussions of individualism and community  
thankfully , it's not subtle in either aspects  
antz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action  
sometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie , but the violence is what should keep kids at home  
the battle scene has ants melting in acid , and bugs being speared to death  
and the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight  
but other than that ( and some sexual innuendos ) , it's a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters  
i doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough , but it's still advisable to leave really young children at home  
have i confused you enough ? 
if you do take your kids , i recommend seeing the film with them , because more than likely , you'll enjoy it the most "

1,"alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters  
i saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i didn't like it  
of course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault  
in order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor  
james cameron's aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series  
i am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality  
many thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action  
both are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well-written  
as for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion  
perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped  
on the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn't see  
it was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh  
i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities  
don't get me wrong--i'm not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting  
however , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters  
as a result , alien 3's only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters  
we never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie  
there were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt  ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films  
the other character was dr  clemens ( charles dance ) , but because we like him , the inevitable occurs  
alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off  
the prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry  
without using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film  
an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card  
we see lt  ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments    
 ( title )    
a shot of an alien egg    
 ( title )    
alien legs stretch up into the air    
 ( title )    
and so on and so on  
during these first ten minutes , i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed  
it's quite a remarkable opening , and one which will remain in my mind for a long time  
because of this face-hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens , the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod , and sent down to the nearest planet : fiorina fury-161 , an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison  
however , the face-hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo-tubes , and is sent down with the escape pod  
unfortunately , during the landing , all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed  
ripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery  
of course , you need a carrier for this face-hugger , and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates  
ripley is revived and asks to see the ship  
after seeing a mysterious acid-eaten section , ripley asks to see the dead bodies , and then have them cremated  
this cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films  
featuring a monologue from dillon ( charles s  dutton ) , a prisoner who has found god , the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dog's demise  
it's one of the most memorable moments , as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog  
and this is where alien 3 succeeds  
fincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films , and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock ( in fact , he is the mixture of both )  
fincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it , and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films  
alien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images  
by doing so , fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise  
many people have criticized fincher's filming of the death scene of ripley ( i reveal nothing by saying this ) as looking too fake , but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal  
showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch , but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron , a great deal of symbolism is derived  
i feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron  
however , most people seem to want to witness ripley die ( which creates a paradox , as she is the character i didn't want to see die )  
why she is killed is one of the surprises of the film , and i don't plan on spoiling that in this review  
>from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever  
in alien , it was , of course , the moment the alien burst out of kane's stomach  
in aliens , it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine  
alien 3 has several , but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley  
ripley is pushed up against a wall , and the alien stands inches away from her  
why it doesn't kill her is a shocker , which later leads to a surprise ending  
fincher apparently loves to use close-ups of actors' faces ( michael douglas and the clown face-off in the game in the same style ) , and by shaving off the actors' hair , the only thing we have to look at is their faces  
many critics didn't like all the actors being bald , but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot  
most of alien 3 works when you take it in context of the story , but when you try to compare it to its predecessors , fincher's turn seems a bit gloomy and dark , though that's not always a bad thing  
the plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films , with some major twists  
again , we are setup with several different characters , and one by one , they are picked off  
however , while the first two had tons of arsenal ( especially cameron's film ) , alien 3 takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this run-down prison  
as a result , no weapons are to be found  
this creates a lot of tension , although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense  
as an alien film , alien 3 is the worst of the series , but by itself , it is an extremely well-made motion picture , with a lot more merits than not  
the unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the one-dimensional characters  
i never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about  
despite this , ripley was the central figure , and that's what is important  
we care for her , even though she began to act just like one of the guys  
again , the technical side of this film is remarkable , and better than the two previous versions  
while cameron's version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary , fincher uses brilliant camera angles , terrific lighting , and moody sets  
the cinematography , by alex thomson , is very well done , with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie  
the confusion of the ending draws the viewer in , as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around  
the yellows , reds , and oranges of the lights create a dark mood , and by themselves create a lot of suspense  
shadows dance on the walls , and yet those shadows could easily be the alien  
the alien is different from its predecessors this time around , and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense  
the camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien , racing after the characters  
the sets are quite incredible , which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien  
the narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed  
the sets appear to be in the future , but not too far in the future  
one of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien ( nothing surprising there )  
sigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance , equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens  
she was snubbed at the oscars for this one , mainly because the film was a critical bomb  
her reactions are far more realistic in this film , with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter  
it's quite touching really  
charles s  dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates , and i was on the brink of actually caring for him  
charles dance turns in a nice low-key performance , and as a result , i cared for him immediately  
lance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii , but he was more entertaining in aliens  
the rest of the cast is pretty stale , though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world  
alien 3 is rated r for strong violence and language , and sex  
although it has its flaws , alien 3 is highly entertaining with rich symbolism  
this film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movie  
while kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films , fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out  
it's a film like fincher's which reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity ( the final scene ) "

-1,"welcome to your oh-so typical sequel  
it tries to be twice as big as it's predecessor , yet ends up twice as shallow  
shallow     hmm    now there's an idea  
maybe if the ill-fated cruise liner in this movie had struck a shallow reef early on things may have turned out better  
the first thing that struck me    and 
surprised me , was that the camera work ( for the opening sequence anyway ) was terrible  
looked like the cameramen were drunk and kept tripping on their own feet       very 
different to the original movie  
the characters ? 
well , not many of the characters actually * had * characters , but here's a rundown  
annie , who was the highlight of the the original , must have seriously banged her head in the train crash at the end of the first movie  
why ? 
because something's got to account for her losing that many iq points  
even though annie wasn't exactly a rocket scientist in speed , here some of her actions just make you want to beat your head against a wall  
for instance , after successfully using a chainsaw to cut a hole in a door so that a group of people can escape noxious gases - she stands in the middle of the opening for about five minutes till someone reminds her that the people can't get ut till she get's the chainsaw out of their faces     bang 
bang bang 
in point of fact sandra's character is turned into little more than one of those scantly dressed extras from hercules , who constantly has to be rescued  
jason patric ? 
all i can say is bring back keanu  
keanu reeves might have the emotional range of a tree stump    but 
that's one more tree stump than jason has  
i don't think he changed facial expressions all movie - jason , smile for the cameras ! ! 
now frown !    i said frown     oh    you are    bang 
bang bang   
wooden just doesn't describe this guys performance , but it'll have to do  
the bad guy      ahh    william 
dafoe - there's a bright move  
how can you go wrong with the star from that acknowledged classic , body of evidence ? 
 ( yes , that is sarcasm )  
his wide eyed maniac of a character doesn't start out too bad     but 
goes steadily downhill as the movie progresses  
in the end he degenerates to chasing annie around for a hostage , even though he already has the money and can escape     bang 
bang  
though i'd like to give this movie a double thumbs down , there were some nice sequences  
considering the movie cost over 100 million dollars - you'd hope there'd be at least a couple  
the real eye-popper for me , even though it was given away in the trailer     bang 
bang      was the sequence where the cruise liner sideswipes the oil tanker  
this looks terrific and i was very surprised to hear that the cruise liner in it was     completely 
computer generated ! 
wow     i 
don't think i've ever seen a cg model look so real before  
the sequence where jason patric in trying to disable the propellers from under the ship is also terrific , and the only time during the entire movie where you get that feeling of     speed  
this lack-of-speed problem affects many sequences  
such as the oil tanker part      it was - "" oh no , we're going to hit the oil tanker ! "" , 
20 minutes later - "" oh no , we're going to hit the oil tanker ! "" 
20 min     you 
get the point  
this movie failed simply because it didn't live up to it's name    "

-1,"a hotshot lawyer gets an obviously guilty child molester acquitted , and shortly after during the victory celebration gets offered an opportunity to show his prowess in new york city  
the lawyer , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is not offered a job yet , he is asked to simply pick a jury  
he accepts  
the jury he selects work out well and before long he is offered a job with the firm  
making his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money , but a gorgeous apartment  
he convinces his wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) to make the move to new york  
the first case given to him is a big test ; a "" winless "" case concerning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement  
the charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal  
his new boss and partner in the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing , explaining many of his philosophies on law , women and sex , and angles the promise of a blissful , wealthy life  
kevin's next case is a dream case , given to him by milton himself ( much to the chagrin to his colleagues ) , defending a triple murder suspect who has had a history of problems with the law  
although kevin's career is taking off , his home life is not doing very well  
mary ann is starting to have numerous problems  
she is experiencing severe depression over kevin's long hours , and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls , their faces becoming horribly disfigured  
kevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife  
he does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with , then focus all of his attention on his wife  
not helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer ( connie nielson ) also working with the firm  
mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home  
kevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife , and gets disturbing news from his mother ( judith ivey ) about the mystery concerning the identity of his father  
he also starts to lose control of his case  
kevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man  
that man is his boss , mr  milton , a truly evil character who just may be the devil himself  
kevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store  
but how do you defeat the devil ? 
why is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd ? 
do filmmakers really believe that "" normal "" courtroom drama doesn't fit the bill and they have to juice them up ? 
the courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in a real courtroom , which wouldn't have been too bad if it weren't keanu reeves trying to pull it off  
i give reeves credit for trying hard , but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character , just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short  
charlize theron defines the term "" over-the-top "" in her performance as mary ann lomax , a disappointment in contrast to her good performance in "" 2 days in the valley ""  
the only good performance in the movie is by al pacino , but i kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess ? 
maybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil , and you can tell he is having fun doing so , but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him  
it's pretty standard stuff , including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom  
please read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled , but i have to get something off of my chest  
in 1986 i remember watching a movie called "" wisdom "" with emilio estevez and demi moore , and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do  
what i like to call "" guess what , it was all a dream "" scenario  
in "" wisdom "" the two lead characters are killed at the end , only to have one of the characters "" wake up "" from an apparent and say "" gosh , i'm glad that didn't really happen ! ""  
i considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with  
well , the same thing happens in "" the devils advocate "" , and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream ( perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan , since it failed and he is the devil ) , but the point is that the last 90% of the film didn't happen  
i know it's a stretch , after all it is a movie and nothing really happened , but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that  
of course , the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one  
as i recall , "" wisdom "" was a decent film  
 "" the devil's advocate "" is not  
the devils advocate

 "" it's just    
the way    
we are  "" 
--- a rapist ( matt frewer ) responds to supergirl's ( helen slater ) query as to why she's being attacked , an example of the mind-numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl  
i'll admit it    
i love superman iii  
i know it's hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor , but i still think it's a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise  
supergirl , a spin-off film of sorts from the series' same producers ( alexander and ilya salkind ) , doesn't even rival superman iii in terms of quality , let alone superman or superman ii  
supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time  
as the film begins we see the residents of argo city , a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in "" inner space "" , go about their daily lives  
ok    
what ? 
so these are exiles from krypton , which blew up right ? 
were they living there before krypton exploded ? 
how do you get to "" inner space "" ? 
this whole "" inner space "" notion is never explained , particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world  
how do they know where superman went ? 
how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ? 
these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me  
argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron  
one day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o' toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman's cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art  
kara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of "" whatever "" that protects the city  
in the chaos , the omegahedron sails out through the opening , dooming the argonians to death    
in three days time , or something  
kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world  
the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who , immediately before her dip was ruined , announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook )  
selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination  
selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she's arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume )  
supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives  
ok    
huh ? 
why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ? 
attention movie : explain yourself ! 
i'm sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much  
i can't buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to  
knowing that she needs a secret identity , supergirl basically "" wills "" herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle ) , picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school  
she's given her dorm assignment , and who happens to be her roommate ? 
lois lane's sister , lucy  
ok , coincidence is one thing folks , but we're getting really contrived now  
what follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks    
complete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason , of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! )  
best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks  
at this point i'm rapidly wondering why i'm bothering with this nonsense  
there is some credit to give to the film however  
one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an "" evil "" bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its "" prey "" is very well done  
also , its commendable to see genders reversed in the film , whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools  
hart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara's love interest , a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film's more ridiculous moments , when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some "" menacing "" bumper cars )  
then there were numerous little things that bothered me  
the flying effects are never convincing for a moment    
it's all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires  
instead of having her look like she's flying , the filmmakers wanted her to be "" graceful "" , so she poses a lot and does ballet-type maneuvers  
also , who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth ? 
a pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a "" wacky "" demise  
there is also some rampant product placement in the film , most notably for popeye's , tylenol , and a&w root beer , with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? ! )  
finally , just one word : monsters  
faye dunaway and peter o'toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o'toole overacts he's entertaining and when dunaway does it she's annoying ( her character actually says the line "" seize them ! "" 
at one point )  
dunaway's henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty's otis character from the first two superman movies  
helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she's written to be , as she's able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable  
believability aside though , it's still annoying  
now despite all this negativity ( and i'm not alone here    supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd ! 
they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself    
yet i'm still unclear as to why , since this movie is so awful )  
the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u  s  theaters  
the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2  35 : 1 , is enhanced for 16x9 televisions , and has been remastered in full thx glory  
extras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and "" special project consultant "" scott michael bosco , the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! ) , 5 trailers , 3 tv spots , talent bios , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie ) , and assorted still galleries  
the transfer on this international version is incredible    
you'd think you were watching a new release  
images are sharp , colors jump off the screen , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts  
only some special effects sequences show the wear of time , and there just isn't much that can be done about that ( unless you're obsessive like george lucas )  
the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places , however you'll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to john williams' classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films' golan-globus production )  
the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries  
bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there's no dead air on the track  
bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation  
although , at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc , and is surprised when he doesn't get that response  
we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track , most notably the "" almost "" appearance in the film by christopher reeve  
great detail is given about superman's proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out  
as it stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission  
for the sake of brevity , i won't even get into that one  
szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own , replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy "" whimsical fantasy "" nonsense  
bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along , claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office  
again , for the sake of brevity , i won't even get into that one  
anchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 , 000 copies pressed ) two-disc set  
disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release  
disc two features the never before seen director's cut of the film , which runs 138 minutes long  
the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don't add much of note , except for a few moments which lengthen peter o'toole's screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances )  
the print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono , but fans of the film won't care  
one question though    
shouldn't the director's commentary be on the director's cut of the film ? 
i'd never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd  
i was nine when it was released to theaters , and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it  
so when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect  
i knew the film wasn't beloved and i never had any interest in it before , but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc  
as the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong  
come to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo    
so i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started  
at the end of the film , supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron , and flies back to argo city "

-1,"kate ( jennifer aniston ) is having some problems  
it appears the twenty-eight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder , and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired  
she learns that her problems are related , as the owner of her advertising agency , mr  mercer ( kevin dunn ) , explains to her that her single status does not bode well with the company  
her freedom would make her more likely to leave the company , taking clients with her  
a solution presents itself in nick ( jay mohr ) , a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coincidence and gets photographed with  
kate's boss , darcy ( illeana douglas ) , uses the photograph to fabricate a wedding engagement between kate and nick  
kate is at first repulsed by the idea , but after getting immediate positive results , she pursues it  
her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan  
the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc ?  
at a dinner with kate's bosses he will provoke a fight and they will break up  
she meets nick to propose the plan  
he accepts  
kate's new status brings unexpected results in other areas  
the office bad boy , sam ( kevin bacon ) , who wouldn't give kate the time of day , now does  
now that she is engaged , he pursues an affair with her , as doing so would destroy her good girl image , hence sam's sudden interest  
things start to fall apart for kate , as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her , and does not wish to break up with her  
after some provoking nick does oblige , but problems continue for kate  
it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available  
or maybe kate does like nick , but "" reconciliation "" will force her to admit her lies to her employer  
adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother ( olympia dukakis ) , who wants her to get married and settle down  
there is a scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is ( from the waist up ) only wearing a bra  
it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one  
there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer  
it's like the director said 'well , we know the story is formulaic and the performances aren't that great so , what the heck , let's show jennifer's assets as often and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating  "" 
quite frankly it's insulting  
i don't think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie  
she did a decent enough job in ed burns' "" she's the one "" because it was a smaller and supporting role , and she just doesn't deliver the goods effectively in this movie  
her performance was not convincing  
unfortunately , as far as romantic comedies go , this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies  
the film is similar to "" my best friends wedding "" in a sense that the leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her actions , gets no sympathy from me when things go awry  
i didn't care for how quickly kate puts down nick's profession by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn't glamorous enough for her co-workers  
at least "" my best friends wedding "" changed the formula a bit and had a somewhat surprise ending  
no such luck with "" picture perfect ""  
every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away , including a couple that really made no sense  
after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company , why would she blindly throw it all away when she should have made sure that nick would even talk to her first , let alone consider a relationship ? 
was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick ? 
throw in the fact that i don't think nick and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of a decision  
i believe that kate liked him , but liked him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away ? 
i doubt it  
and what of the ending scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the couple ? 
are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers ? 
well , i guess of the congregation consists of movie extras and the strangers are the movies two lead stars , then that would make sense  
picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron 
kate                         jennifer aniston nick                         jay
